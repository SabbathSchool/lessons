### READINGS.
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 98-104; "Great Controversy," pp. 613-652.

### NOTE.
Note that the book of Genesis is a definite revelation. It is just as precise and sacred a history as the book of Revelation is definite and divine as prophecy. It is the only authentic record of the world before the Deluge, and perhaps for a long time thereafter. It is beautiful in its simplicity, and glorious in its expression of the infinite thought of God towards man in the gospel of creation and redemption.

The flood of waters reveals to us the present state of the world as no geological or astronomical science can. The wonderful changes wrought in the earth can only be imagined from that which is now seen in the things of nature, or known from divine revelation itself.
