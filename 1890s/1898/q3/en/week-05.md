### NOTES.

1. "Cain and Abel represent two classes that will exist in the world till the close of time. One class avail themselves of the appointed sacrifice for sin; the other venture to depend upon their own merits; theirs is a sacrifice without the virtue of divine mediation, and thus it is not able to bring man into favor with God. It is only through the merits of Jesus that our transgressions can be pardoned. Those who feel no need of the blood of Christ, who feel that without divine grace they can, by their own works, secure the approval of God, are making the same mistake as did Cain. If they do not accept the cleansing blood, they are under condemnation. There is no other provision made whereby they can be released from the thraldom of sin.

"The class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain includes by far the greater portion of the world; for nearly every false religion has been based on the same principle,—that man can depend upon his own efforts for salvation. It is claimed by some that the human race is in need, not of redemption, but of development,—that it can refine, elevate, and regenerate itself. As Cain thought to secure the divine favor by an offering that lacked the blood of a sacrifice, so do these expect to exalt humanity to the divine standard, independent of the atonement. The history of Cain shows what must be the result. It shows what man will become, apart from Christ. Humanity has no power to regenerate itself. It does not tend upward, toward the divine, but downward, toward the Satanic. Christ is our only hope. 'There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.' 'Neither is there salvation in any other.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 72, 73.

2. "'And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.' How easily the temper of the disobedient toward God is stirred when his plans do not carry, and he is disappointed in his expectations!

"The Lord saw the wrath of Cain; He saw the falling of his countenance. Thus is revealed how closely the Lord marks man's every action, all his intents and purposes, yes, even to the expressions of his countenance. This, though man may say nothing, expresses his refusal to do the way and will of God.

"Mark the words of the Lord. 'And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?' These questions may be addressed to every one who, like Cain, reveals his passion because he is not commended by others when acting out the promptings of Satan, and which are in direct opposition to the requirements of God."
