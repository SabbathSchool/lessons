### READINGS.
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. ___ or "Christian Education," pp. 190-197.

### NOTE.
"If God's revealed will is so difficult to be understood, certainly men should not rest their faith upon mere suppositions in regard to that which He has not revealed. God's ways are not our ways, neither are His thoughts our thoughts. Human science can never account for his wondrous works. God so ordered that men, beasts, and trees, many times larger than those now upon the earth, and other things, should be buried in the earth at the time of the flood, and there be preserved to evidence to man that the inhabitants of the old world perished by a flood. God designed that the discovery of these things in the earth should establish the faith of men in inspired history."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1, p. 90.
