"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 117-124. "Empires of the Bible," pp. 1-5.

### NOTES.

1. "The flesh of dead animals was not the original food for man. Man was permitted to eat it after the flood, because all vegetation had been destroyed... Since the flood the human race has been shortening the period of its existence. Physical, mental, and moral degeneracy is rapidly increasing in these last days."—Mrs. E. G. W.

2. "His [God's] love is the glory of the rainbow encircling the throne on high... In the rainbow above the throne is the everlasting testimony that 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'... Point to the throne, arched with the rainbow of promise, the righteousness of Christ. As the bow in the cloud is formed by the union of the sunlight and the shower, so the rainbow encircling the throne represents the combined power of mercy and justice. It is not justice alone that is to be maintained; for this would eclipse the glory, of the rainbow of promise above the throne; men could see only the penalty of the law. Were there no justice, no penalty, there would be no stability to the government of God."—Mrs. E. G. W, in Review, 1892, No. 49. See also "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 106, 107.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY.

1. How many great curses rested upon the earth when Noah came out of the ark?

2. What took the place of affection towards men on the part of the animal creation? See also James 3:7.

3. What does the bow of promise mean to us?—It is the covenant of righteousness and peace. See Isa. 54:7-10; Luke 2:14; John 14:27.

4. Show that the distinction of beasts into clean and unclean was known before the flood. See Leviticus 11 for Bible classification.

5. Was the division of animals into clean and unclean a part of the ceremonial law? Give reason for your reply.
