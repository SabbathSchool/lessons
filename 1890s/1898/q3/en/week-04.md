### NOTES.

1. God, knowing all things, did not consult with Adam and Eve with reference to the laying of the plan of salvation; but even before announcing to them their punishment, He lovingly pointed them forward to the Life-giver, to the "Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world." In this promise, the "enmity," is contained the whole plan of salvation, and that mighty struggle between the powers of light and darkness which will finally result in the utter destruction of sinners and Satan, of sin and death.

"When the Lord Jesus visited our earth, He brought with Him renovating energy. He put enmity between the seed of the woman and the serpent. But there is no enmity between fallen angels and fallen men. Both, through apostasy, are evil; and wherever there is evil, with no disposition to repent, it will always league with Satan against God."—Review, Jan. 26, 1897.

"God declares, 'I will put enmity.' This enmity is not naturally entertained. When man transgressed the divine law, his nature became evil, and he was in harmony and not at variance with Satan. There exists naturally no enmity between sinful man and the originator of sin. Both became evil through apostasy... It is the grace that Christ implants in the soul which creates in man enmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and renewing power, man would continue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his bidding. But the new principle in the soul creates conflict where hitherto had been peace. The power which Christ imparts, enables man to resist the tyrant and usurper. Whoever is seen to abhor sin instead of loving it, whoever resists and conquers those passions that have held sway within, displays the operation of a principle wholly from above."—Great Controversy, pp. 505, 506. God's love in the heart constrains the righteous, but, not being in the hearts of the wicked, it only restrains them.

2. "The halo of glory, which God had given to holy Adam to cover him as a garment, departed from him after his transgression. The light of God's glory could not cover disobedience and sin." When the plan of salvation had been announced to Adam and Eve, God made them coats of skins, in order to turn their minds back to Christ, through whom only they could be clothed with the robes of His righteousness.
