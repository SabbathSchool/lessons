### READINGS.
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 138-144. "Mount of Blessing," pp. 55-66.

### NOTE.
The salvation which comes to this world through grace is by that faith which works through the love of God, and is manifested in Christ, through the Holy Spirit, through the angels, in those who are represented in the sermon on the mount as being "the salt of the earth," "the light of the world." All the power is of God. Christ said, "For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth." God blessed faithful Abraham, as He does every child of faith, that he might be a blessing to others. This can be accomplished only by the vitalizing power and influence of the Holy Spirit, represented by the golden oil flowing through the golden tubes into the golden bowl—by the grace, love, and righteousness of Christ brought to others by the personal contact and association of the Christian with them. For the sake of the righteous, the Lord preserves the world; and as soon as they are taken out of it, the world will be destroyed. "Were it not for the few righteous who inhabit the earth, the wrath of God would not be delayed a moment from punishing the wicked."

### ADDITIONAL STUDY.
1. The chronology used in the Bible is known as that of Usher. (a) Show that Noah came out of the ark A. M. 1657. Gen. 7:11; 8:14. (b) Show that Arphaxad was born A. M. 1659. Gen. 11:10. (c) Show that Terah was born A. M. 1879. Verses 12-24. (d) Show that Abraham was born A. M. 2009. Gen. 11:32; 12:4; Acts 7:4. (e) Show that Abraham left Haran to go into Canaan A. M. 2084. lb. (f) Note that the four hundred years of Gen. 15:13-16 must date thirty years after the call of Abraham out of "Ur of the Chaldees." (g) Note the precision with which the genealogy and chronology of the ancestors of the promised Seed are given. This is the only line so preserved; could any other than a divine hand have kept it? For a more extended study of this subject see "Sacred Chronology," pp. 45-68.

2. Note Abraham's anxiety for the salvation of those wicked cities. The more nearly one approaches the perfection of Christ, the greater will his love be toward the sinner.

3. Who were the three men? Gen. 18:13; 19:1.

4. Abraham's talking with God is an illustration of what He asks all to do: He says, "Come, let us reason together."

5. Why did the Lord make such wonderful revelations to Abraham? to his prophets? Amos 3:7. Abraham was not only a friend of God, but a prophet. Gen. 20:7.

6. Cite examples of how other holy men felt in the presence of God or of angels. In whose presence are we always? Give proof.
