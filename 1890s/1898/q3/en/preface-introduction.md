# SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF GENESIS

For Senior Classes

THIRD QUARTER, 1898

## PREFACE

The book of Genesis is a sacred history, and a divine revelation of the "beginning of things." It makes known man's high origin as the offspring of God in creation. Compared with secular history, it is indeed prehistoric, and in the positive truthfulness of its statements it antedates the discovery, and puts to shame the assumptions, of geological science.

Speaking of the record of creation, Weidner well says, "We have a plain, simple account of the works of God, and though it is deep and beyond our comprehension, nevertheless, from this first page of the Bible a child may learn more in an hour than all the philosophers of the world were able to discover without it in four thousand years." It is the book of the Bible, adapted alike to the study of old and young. Its history, description, and biography fascinate the children, while its divine philosophy and grand summaries of the infinite thought captivate, astonish, and confound even the noblest soul of the most intellectual man. That it is inspired, and that it was written by Moses, is here taken for granted.

In studying this series of lessons the following order is thought by the writer to be best: 
(a) Read carefully the verses in Genesis several times. 
(b) Question every thought individually, and in its connections with other portions of the lesson. 
(c) Read and answer the questions on the text in the lesson pamphlet. 
(d) Outline the lesson on paper. 
(e) Ask and answer questions from your outline. 
(f) Fix your outline in memory, and recite the lesson mentally from it. 
(g) Look over the questions for "additional study," and trace out those lines of thought in which you may be especially interested. 
(h) Critically read the notes. 
(i) Set apart a definite time during the week for reading the articles referred to in "Patriarchs and Prophets," etc. 
(j) Be sure to review mentally every week, the previous lessons from the outlines you have already made and learned. 
(k) Study to know the truth and to obey it, remembering that "if any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching." Those who have courage enough to follow the above plan will not fail to receive much good from the study of the book of Genesis.

References to "Patriarchs and Prophets" are to the subscription edition.

## PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF THE S. S. LESSONS

SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of the Sabbath.) Read carefully the lesson for the next Sabbath, and assign verses to be memorized during the week.

SUNDAY.—Name the persons and places mentioned in the lesson, and locate the places on the map. Pronounce and define the hard words.

MONDAY.—Let each tell what he can of the lesson, and then read it over, carefully noting the points which were not remembered.

TUESDAY.—Repeat verses already committed to memory. Read the "Spirit of Prophecy" on the lesson, or study the lesson from the Instructor or Little Friend.

WEDNESDAY.—Let each give a synopsis of the lesson, or tell the lesson story. Look up the ancient manners and customs referred to.

THURSDAY.—Name again the persons mentioned, and tell what each said or did. Give time and place of each event.

FRIDAY.—Ask the questions from the lesson book, study the notes, and repeat the memory verses.

SABBATH.—Let each repeat as much of the lesson scripture as possible. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson. Relate personal experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been helpful.

(This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily, systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school lessons.)
