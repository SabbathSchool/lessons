## Additional Questions and Suggestions

1. In verse 20, where we have "how many thousands," the Greek has "myriads" instead of the word for thousands. A myriad is ten thousand. So what the elders really said as to the number of the believing Jews in Jerusalem, was, "Thou seest, brother, how many ten thousands of Jews there are which believe."
2. If Paul had not heeded the advice of the elders to try to prove to the people that he was law-abiding, could he have gotten into any more difficulty than he did? What lesson may we learn as to going out of the way to do something merely to show that we are right, that is, doing a thing merely for effect?
3. What occasion is referred to in verse 25? Recall Peter's words on that occasion which largely influenced the decision. He said, referring to the Gentiles, "God... put no difference between us and them." Was the advice given to Paul by the elders (Acts 21:24, 25) in harmony with what was said in that assembly?
4. Note that although Greek was the common language even among the Jews in Paul's day, he spoke to them in Hebrew. Why was this?
