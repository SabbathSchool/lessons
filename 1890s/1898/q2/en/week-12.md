# Lesson 12 - June 18, 1898

## Review
(Acts 1-14)

Noteâ€”In the course of the year there have been many review questions besides the quarterly review, the object being to keep the mind of the pupil continually on the text. We have now covered the entire book of Acts in fifty lessons, of which three have been review lessons. Whether the lessons have been well learned or not, all will find it very profitable to devote the remaining two weeks of the quarter to review. If the book has not been thoroughly studied, then the review is especially necessary; if it has been carefully and thoroughly studied, then the reviews will be especially welcome, because the task will not be difficult, and because there is no portion of the Bible from which one can learn so much as from that which has been already well learned. The Bible is an inexhaustible mine. The deeper you go, the richer and more abundant are its treasures; the more you have, the more there is for you to get; for "whosoever hath, to him shall be given."

Each of these review lessons covers fourteen chapters, so that the student will have two chapters a day during each week. Of course it is understood that even the most faithful student has not mastered the entire book; that is in fact impossible; yet it is possible to acquire so thorough a knowledge of it that whenever any chapter is mentioned, the mind will at once recall its contents, or, if any event is referred to, or any statement quoted, it can at once be located, and the connection given. No one should be satisfied short of this. When this is gained, then can one really find satisfaction in studying the book. It can thus be seen that the study of the book must by no means end with this series of lessons. Indeed, the only way to keep what you already have is to continue the study, and gain more. The questions that follow are only suggestive. There is no end to the number that may be asked. It would be well in each class to have a brief outline of the chapters. This need take but a few minutes. Go through the questions in order and then ask promiscuous questions. Then the teacher can use his judgment as to what topics he will call special attention to. In a review lesson of all lessons, the teacher should confine himself strictly to asking questions.

1. Tell the chief things recorded in Acts 1.
2. To what one thing is the second chapter devoted?
