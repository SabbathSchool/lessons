## A Card

Are you a worker for God? If not, why not? He has a great work yet to be done, and many effective ways of accomplishing it. What He wants is mediums that He can useâ€”men, women, and children who will give their hearts to Him and will co-operate with Him in one or more of His many ways.

One favorable opportunity for work that He has placed within the reach of all, is the distribution of literature. What is more effective in this line than a weekly paper; and where can you find a neater, nicer paper, a more comprehensive and effective instrument in this work for souls, than the SIGNS OF THE TIMES? If all the 26,000 who receive this pamphlet and who read this card, would do something, secure one or more subscribers, what a grand work would be accomplished! Try it at your first opportunity. Write for special terms to agents, sample copies, etc.

## An Invitation

### The Story of Redemption

Is the title of our latest book. Its object is to preach Christ to the world, to assure the sinner that the plan of redemption was planned for him. It abounds with new and beautiful truths concerning the redemption of man, and will leave the reader an inspiration for a higher and nobler life.

One chapter is entitled "Righteousness Received through Christ," and so plainly and carefully is the wonderful truth explained that it seems impossible for the honest reader to misunderstand it. In fact, it is a practical book, an evangelical book, and a book that will draw men to Christ. It does not present many doctrinal points, it is true; but as we have other books thoroughly covering those things, the author has not deemed it necessary to treat them here.

A great effort has been made to illustrate the work in a way that will impress upon the mind the truths of the text. The utmost care has been taken in the printing and binding, that they, also, may appropriately set forth the Gospel.

Having done all we can, we invite you to give this book to the world. For terms, territory and prices, address your State Tract Society or the publishers.
