## Additional Questions and Suggestions

1. What striking comments have we in this lesson on "Roman justice"?
2. Note how lightly Festus put the cause of contention between Paul and the Jews. It was concerning "one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive." How much more, if any, is there to the Gospel than the statement of this question? Is Jesus alive? How do you know?
