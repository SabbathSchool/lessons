## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. "Too superstitious." Revised Version, "somewhat superstitious;" margin, "religious." Nearly all other translations have it, "very religious," or "greatly devoted to the worship of the gods." While it is true that all heathen worship is superstitious, we may be sure that the apostle Paul did not begin his discourse with words calculated to arouse the anger of his hearers, and so we may know that the words did not convey to their minds the same idea as the expression, "Ye are in all things too superstitious," does to ours. The statement, "Ye are very religious," was the truth, and naturally opened the way for what followed.

2. "If haply they might feel after Him and find Him." Notice exactly what is said here. Is the doubt implied as to whether men would find the Lord, or as to whether they would feel after Him? If men feel after the Lord, is there any question as to the certainty of their finding Him? What makes it more than sure that they who seek the Lord will find Him? Isa. 65:1.

3. "The times of this ignorance God winked at." The Revised Version and some others have it, "overlooked," which is an exactly literal rendering of the Greek. Several translations have it "bore with," which also expresses the sense. Compare Acts 14:16 and Heb. 5:2.
