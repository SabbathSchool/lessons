"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." Deut. 6:6, 7.

"Parents, set apart a little time each day for the study of the Sabbath-school lesson with your children."â€”Mrs. E. G. White.

## PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF THE S. S. LESSONS.

| Day | Study Activity |
|-----|---------------|
| SABBATH | (After church services or at the close of the Sabbath.) Read carefully the lesson for the next Sabbath, and assign verses to be memorized during the week. |
| SUNDAY | Name the persons and places mentioned in the lesson, and locate the places on the map. Pronounce and define the hard words. |
| MONDAY | Let each tell what he can of the lesson, and then read it over, carefully noting the points which were not remembered. |
| TUESDAY | Repeat verses already committed to memory. Read the "Spirit of Prophecy" on the lesson, or study the lesson from the Instructor or Little Friend. |
| WEDNESDAY | Let each give a synopsis of the lesson, or tell the lesson story. Look up the ancient manners and customs referred to. |
| THURSDAY | Name again the persons mentioned, and tell what each said or did. Give time and place of each event. |
| FRIDAY | Ask the questions from the lesson book, study the notes, and repeat the memory verses. |
| SABBATH | Let each repeat as much of the lesson scripture as possible. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson. Relate personal experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been helpful. |

(This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily, systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school lessons.)

# SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS.

## TO BE READ BY ALL.

STUDY the text thoroughly. Although the lessons may seem long when considered in relation to the half hour allowed to them in the Sabbath-school, they are really very short when considered in relation to the entire week, which may be devoted to the study of each one. It should be a comparatively light task for anybody to become thoroughly familiar with the book of Acts in an entire year. At the close of that time, every one who has followed the lessons through, ought to be able to locate off-hand any passage or incident, or to give the main features of any chapter. Each one who conscientiously works to this end, will find that the entering of the Word gives light.

To avoid confusion, it is best in general to get the text of the lesson well in mind before launching out to other scriptures. It is the book of Acts we are studying, and this should be studied and learned first of all. Then it will furnish a good nucleus around which to gather other portions of scripture. One portion well fixed in mind, will help to hold many others.

Don't confine yourself to the questions given, only let all your questions be directly on the text. These questions are suggestive, and not by any means exhaustive. He who can dispense with the lesson book entirely, and question directly from the Bible, does the best work; but let him not fail to stick to the Bible. Ask questions on the text, and only such as can be answered by the text of the lesson, or by some parallel scripture.
