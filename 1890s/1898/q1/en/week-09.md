## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." What had John proclaimed in his preaching? Matt. 3:11. Could these twelve men, then, ever have seen or heard John the Baptist? Could they have been at all acquainted with John's teaching? Had they, judging from Acts 19:4, 5, even heard anything about Christ? In whom, then, had they been blindly believing?

2. "'Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?' The two verbs are in the aorist tense, and therefore denote instantaneous acts. The Authorized Version therefore gives an entirely wrong idea, as there is no question about what happened after believing; but the question relates to what occurred when they believed. Hence (Revised Version) rightly, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed? 'We have not heard.' Also the aorist. We did not hear, referring back to the time of their beginning. 'Whether there be any Holy Ghost.' But, as Bengel observes, 'They could not have followed either Moses or John the Baptist without having heard of the Holy Ghost.' The words, therefore, are to be explained, not of their being unaware of the existence of the Holy Ghost, but of his presence and baptism on earth. The word estin, there be, is to be taken in the sense of be present, or be given, as in John 7:39, where it is said, 'The Holy Ghost was not yet (onpo in),' and where the translators rightly render, 'was not yet given.'" â€”Vincent.
