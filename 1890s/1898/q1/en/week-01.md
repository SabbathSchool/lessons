## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Prejudice and opposition usually have the effect of discouraging workers, or at least of causing them to think that the field is not a profitable one to remain in; what was the effect on the apostles? Note verses 2, 3. "The unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected towards the brethren. Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord."

2. Note especially the influence of the preaching as indicated in verse 4. It was not for nothing that the apostles abode in Iconium a long time, in spite of, or, rather, because of, the prejudice. They remained until all in the city had taken their stand either for or against the truth. Can the "multitude of the city" mean any less than all in the city? Does the statement that "the multitude of the city was divided, a part held with the Jews, and a part with the apostles," give any indication of the proportion of believers in the city?
