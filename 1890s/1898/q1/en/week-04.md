What was the difference between the reason for which he circumcised Timothy and that given by the men who came from Judea to Antioch?

3. "Forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia." As a matter of fact they were in Asia all the time, that is, they were in the continent of Asia; but as used in the Acts, the word "Asia" signifies what is known as Asia Minorâ€”the extreme western part of the continent. In Biblical maps this portion of the country is designated as Asia.
