4. "Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them." Why was this? Gal. 2:5.

5. The brethren "determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem." Was it in consequence of this decision of the brethren that Paul went up to Jerusalem at this time? See Gal. 2:2.

6. Who was one of the brethren who accompanied Paul? Gal. 2:1.

7. As they went they declared "the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy unto all the brethren." Note that instead of dwelling on the new opposition that had arisen, they proclaimed "good tidings of great joy."
