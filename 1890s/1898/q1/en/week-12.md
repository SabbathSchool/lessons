## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Nothing more sublime and touching can be found than this account and the words of the apostle as he talked, with the certainty of persecution before him. The instruction is most valuable, and so concise that not a single word can be passed lightly over. Special thought and study should be given to it, so that every sentence may be fixed in the mind exactly as the apostle spoke it.

2. Compare verse 19 with the Revised Version, and note how the word "temptations" is used in its original signification of "trials."

3. Compare verse 24 and Phil. 1:12-20.

4. What is the church of God called? What are the elders or overseers to do for it? What is one who feeds a flock? What is an overseer? Has it any such meaning as taskmaster or ruler? Compare 1 Peter 5:1-5.
