### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 204-208.

### NOTE
The life of Jacob is a vivid illustration of the utter futility of human planning to accomplish the designs of God. "The wisdom of any human agent is not sufficient for the planning and devising in this time. Spread every plan before God; with fasting, with the humbling of the soul before the Lord Jesus, and commit thy ways unto the Lord, and the promise is, 'He shall direct thy paths.'" "The Lord will work in this last work in a manner very much out of the common order of things, and in a way that will be contrary to any human planning. . . . God will use ways and means by which it will be seen that He is taking the lines in His own hands. Workers will be surprised by the simple means that He will use to bring about and perfect His work of righteousness." It is by prayer that we know the will and plans of God. It is the prayer, and not the planning, of Jacob that turns the heart of Esau.
