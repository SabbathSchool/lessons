### NOTE
Make a careful study of the fulfilment of this last prophecy of Jacob in the future history of the several tribes. Meyer says: "Reuben, though the first-born, never excelled; no judge, prophet, or ruler, sprang from his tribe. Simeon was almost absorbed in the nomad tribes of southern Palestine. The cities in which the sons of Levi dwelt were scattered throughout all the tribes. Vestiges of terraced vineyards still attest how well the hilly province assigned to Judah suited the culture of the vine. Zebulun embosomed the Lake of Galilee, and stretched away toward the coast of the blue Mediterranean. Esdraelon, the battle-field of Palestine, where Assyria from the north and Egypt from the south often met in deadly feud, lay within the limits of Issachar. Dan was small as an adder, but, like it, could inflict dangerous wounds on any invader who had to pass by it towards the heart of the country. Gad, much pressed by border war. Asher, notable for fertility. Naphtali, famous for eloquence. Benjamin, cruel as a wolf. All these justified the prophecy of their dying ancestor, whilst the mighty tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, springing from the sons of Joseph, inherited to the full 'blessings of heaven above; blessings of the deep that lieth under; blessings of the breast and of the womb; blessings to the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills.'" Jacob's "paternal tenderness would have found expression only in words of encouragement and hope; but the power of God rested upon him, and under the influence of inspiration, he was constrained to declare the truth, however painful."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 237.
