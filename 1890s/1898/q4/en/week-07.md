### NOTES
1. "As the lad stood before his brothers, his beautiful countenance lighted up with the spirit of inspiration, they could not withhold their admiration; but they did not choose to renounce their evil ways, and they hated the purity that reproved their sins. The same spirit that actuated Cain was kindling in their hearts."

2. Stephen says that the "patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt." Acts 7:9. Envy signifies: (1) "Malice; ill-will; spite." (2) "Chagrin, mortification, discontent, or uneasiness at the sight of another's excellence or good fortune; a repining at the prosperity or good of another." Who can stand before envy? Prov. 27:4. The beginning of the history of the children of Israel was marked with envious hatred against their younger brother, just as the end of their history was characterized by the most intensely bitter hatred, even unto death, against their Elder Brother. Joseph was the tender and most-beloved son of his father, through whom he desired communication with his children; but his brethren sold him for twenty pieces of silver: Jesus was the only-begotten Son of God, through whom He emptied His heart of infinite love upon His fallen sons of earth; but they sold Him for thirty pieces of silver.
