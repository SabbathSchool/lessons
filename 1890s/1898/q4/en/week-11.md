### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 229-232.

### NOTES
1. "This cup was supposed to possess power of detecting any poisonous substances placed therein. At that day cups of this kind were highly valued as a safeguard against murder by poisoning. . . . 'What deed is this that ye have done?' he said; 'wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?' Joseph designed to draw from them acknowledgment of their sin. He had never claimed the power of divination, but was willing to have them believe that he could read the secrets of their lives."

2. It is probable that the fame of Joseph had gone out all over the world as an interpreter of dreams, and a preserver of life, on account of his connection with the true and living God. Note the impression which comes into the soul when one recognizes that his life is in accordance with the divine plan. The revelation of God to Joseph in those two dreams of his boyhood, seems to have given direction to his entire inner and outer life. In these verses we see the large-hearted sympathy of Joseph standing out in vivid contrast to the cold-blooded envy which once found lodgment in the hearts of his brethren. His was a high ideal of the Christian life; and his high mission was recognized, not only by himself, but by Pharaoh and his subjects, as well as by Israel and his sons. See Gen. 45:7; 41:45; 47:25; 45:27, 28; 50:18-20.

3. "Another act of humiliation remained for the ten brothers. They now confessed to their father the deceit and cruelty that for so many years had embittered his life and theirs. Jacob had not suspected them of so base a sin; but he saw that all had been overruled for good, and he forgave and blessed his erring children." He no doubt remembered his own course of life which had resulted in so much sorrow and trouble to himself and his loved ones. "Jacob had sinned, and had deeply suffered. . . . Over and over he saw repeated among his sons the sins of which he himself had been guilty. But, bitter as had been the discipline, it had accomplished its work. The chastening, though grievous, had yielded the peaceable fruits of righteousness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 232, 237, 238.

9. Joseph's life is an illustration of the sublime and glorious truth that when Satan seems most successfully to have hidden the light that is burning in the soul loyal to its God, then the flame bursts forth, and the light is lifted up, to be seen both near and afar off, even if it becomes necessary for every nation of the earth to be stricken with famine.
