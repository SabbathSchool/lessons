### NOTES
1. This is the only way back to God. "Here the Redeemer identifies Himself as the mystic ladder that makes communication possible between heaven and earth." "In assuming humanity, Christ planted the ladder firmly upon the earth. The ladder reaches unto the highest heaven, and God's glory shines from its summit, and illuminates its whole length, while the angels pass to and fro with messages from God to man, with petition and praise from man to God. Through the divine nature, Christ was one with the Father; and by assuming humanity, He identified Himself with man. He 'being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.' In the vision of Jacob was represented the union of the human and the divine in Christ. As the angels pass to and fro on the ladder, God is represented as looking down with favor upon the children of men, because of the merit of His Son."

"The sinner can not take one step unless the Spirit draws him; he must cling to Christ if he would be saved. If he ascends to heaven, it must be by mounting up step by step the whole height of Christ's work, so that Christ shall be his wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. The gaining of eternal life is no easy thing. By living faith we are to keep on reaching forward, ascending the ladder round by round, seeing and taking the necessary steps; and yet we must understand that not one holy thought, not one unselfish act, can be originated in self. It is only through Christ that there can be any virtue in humanity. Without Christ we can do no good thing, but with Him we may do all things."—Review, 1890, No. 44.

2. Note the number and the order of the promises made to Jacob in verses 13-15, and the fitness of each to comfort and encourage him ever after that memorable night. What must have been his state of mind and heart on the night previous, in order to receive so glorious a revelation concerning the future of himself and his posterity! (a) He felt lonely; but God said, "I am with thee." (b) He was fearful; but God said, "I will keep thee." (c) He felt forsaken; but God said, "I will not leave thee." (d) He had no property with him; and his father's blessing seemed lost forever; but God said, "I will do that which I have spoken to thee of." (a) He thought that he might be slain; but God said, "In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed." How terrible must Jacob's misdeeds have seemed to him after that angel vision! but how precious the plan of salvation!

### ADDITIONAL STUDY
1. Trace carefully the causes of Jacob's exile. Are we in banishment? If so, why?

2. From the human standpoint, who was most prosperous then, Jacob or Esau?

3. Note that Jacob was forced from lack of faith to do what Isaac was forbidden to do—go to Haran, thus risking his spiritual to save his natural life.

4. What did Jacob take with him when he left home, (a) of the earthly inheritance, (b) of the heavenly birthright? Gen. 28:18; 32:10.

5. Note the order of the causes and effects of sin in the human soul—lack of faith, lack of love, distrustful of man, human planning, human working, bitter hatred on the part of his brother, distrustful of God's protecting care, fearful, fleeing for life.

6. Note the order of return to God; distress, humility, loneliness, repentance, prayer, visions of glory.

7. In what special promise did Adam and Eve see Christ? Did Abel? Enoch? Noah? Abraham? Isaac? Jacob? We?

8. What does every one behold who really sees Christ? See John 1:51. There are two ways of seeing Him—by fear and by love. "This is the finger of God," said the tremblingly opposing Egyptian astrologers; and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened. Ex. 8:19. Love discerns Him. "It is the Lord," said the loving and beloved disciple; and the hearts of the disciples were melted with joy. John 21:7, 8. Behold the ladder; study the ladder; walk upon the ladder; see the angels with you on the ladder; behold God above the ladder.
