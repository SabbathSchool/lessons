### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 213-219.

### NOTES
1. Joseph was comely, winsome, well-favored; but he did not exalt himself. In all Old Testament history there is no life more universally admired for its frank, open, humble simplicity, and the fragrant beauty of its purity; and, withal, in its growth more "strong in a strength not its own." It was his upright and holy life that gave him power with God. But every young man and woman may, by following his example, be like him. "He [man] may be enlightened by science, ennobled by virtue, and make progress in mental and moral dignity, until he reaches a perfection of intelligence and a purity of character but little lower than the perfection and purity of the angels. With the light of truth shining upon the minds of men, and the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, we can not conceive what they may become, nor what great work they may do."

2. What the Lord needs to-day is young men like Joseph and Moses in Egypt, Daniel and his fellows in Babylon, John the Baptist in Judea, and Paul in the civilized and heathen portions of the world. In order to be this, they must, like Joseph, have God with them in the prison; like Moses, endure as seeing Him who is invisible; like Daniel and his fellows, swerve not from duty, though cast into the lions' den, or into the fiery furnace; like John the Baptist, stand before and reprove kings; and, like Paul, pass undaunted through that long category of trial and persecution, counting it all joy that he is considered worthy to suffer for Christ's sake.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY
1. Make an outline of this lesson.

2. In what sense was Joseph a slave? In what sense were his brethren slaves? What is the only real freedom?

3. Consider the life of Potiphar; of Pharaoh.

4. Describe the jail in which Joseph was imprisoned. See Ps. 105:18-20.

5. What was the office relation between Potiphar and the keeper of the prison?

6. The interpretation of the dreams of the butler and the baker were fulfilled within three days. How was it with the interpretation of Joseph's own dreams?

7. Trace the different steps in Joseph's humiliation. Such an experience is a preparation for service.

8. What kept Joseph? What will keep us? Psalms 121, R. V.
