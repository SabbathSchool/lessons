### NOTE
Joseph had learned the lesson of submission to the will of God, so that he did not seek to lay plans, or to concoct schemes, for extricating himself from difficulty; but he left his case to be decided in the higher court. He seemed to be going down the ladder, yet when, to outward observation, he had taken the last step in that direction, he had reached the topmost round even of earthly fame. He followed the law of true greatness—that of service, which is the law of true goodness. Slavery in the dungeon was followed by service on the throne. See Matt. 20:26, 27; 1 Peter 5:6-10; 2 Cor. 12:9; 1 Sam. 2:30; Luke 14:11.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY
1. See how Joseph hid self in God (verse 16), and honored Pharaoh (verse 25).

2. Notice that Potiphar, the keeper of the prison, the butler, and Pharaoh, all alike, recognized the hand of God with Joseph. This illustrates the fact that ability is recognized; and we are generally estimated for all that we are worth.

3. Trace the different steps by which Joseph rose to the premiership.

4. When the Lord gives a man a vision or a dream, it causes him to feel that it is full of meaning.

5. How long was Joseph in Egypt before he was made governor? Note the meaning of the name which Pharaoh gave to Joseph. Gen. 41:45.

6. Who was this Pharaoh?
