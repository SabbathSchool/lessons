### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 177-182.

### NOTE
"There was no arbitrary choice on the part of God, by which Esau was shut out from the blessings of salvation. The gift of His grace through Christ is free to all." Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. This was his own voluntary act. The success of Jacob in defrauding Esau of the blessing which he desired did not deprive him of the privilege of securing God's blessing. See Isa. 55:6, 7; Rev. 22:17. "Man turns from God, not God from him." The responsibility now is with man. God hated Esau only in the sense that He hates sin. See "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 207, 208.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY
1. Read Genesis 26, and note how Isaac followed in the way of his father.

2. What was the nature of Isaac's love for Esau? Gen. 25:28. What effect did Isaac's love for flesh meat have upon his spiritual discernment?

3. Note carefully the meaning of the birthright. See "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 178, 179.

4. What class of people did Esau represent? Jacob? Was Jacob converted at this time? Was his course such as to win Esau to righteousness? What is the meaning of their names?

5. What effect does godly sorrow have upon heart, mind, and character? See 2 Cor. 7:9-11. Is weeping a sure sign of repentance? What is?

8. What lessons are there in this chapter for you? (a) In the life of Esau? (b) In the life of Jacob? (c) In the life of Rebecca? (d) In the life of Isaac?

9. Note that Isaac blessed Jacob in the name of God, but Esau only in his own name, and that this was in harmony with their desires. The one was spiritual, the other carnal. Isaac's words were prophetic. Heb. 11:20.
