## THE BLESSINGS OF THE GOSPEL
### Isaiah 40:1-10

**MEMORY VERSES**: 3, 4

**GOLDEN TEXT**: "And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together." Isa. 40:5.

1. What message does God give his people through the prophet? Isa. 40:1.

*NOTE* - Jerusalem, as the center of worship, the chief city of the kingdom, stands for the people of God. Her sins are the sins committed by them. If the Jews had proved faithful to God, old Jerusalem would have stood forever (Jer. 17:24-27), but as Israel continued to transgress, Jerusalem was destroyed. But this unbelief did not make the promise of God of none effect (Rom. 3:3); God's promises to the faithful are fulfilled through Christ in the new covenant, and to the new covenant city, New Jerusalem, the mother of us all (Gal. 4:24). See Isaiah 54 and Revelation 21.

2. What has been the condition of all God's people here? Isa. 53:6, first two clauses; Rom. 3:23.

3. Though accepted of God, what is their lot? Acts 14:22; 2 Tim. 3:12.

4. Who is their comforter? Isa. 51:3, 12; 61:1-3.

5. How does God comfort them? Isa. 40:2, see margin.

*NOTE* - For the latter part of the verse, compare Jer. 16:18 with 17:18. Jerusalem's double punishment seemed to be double destruction to the earthly city. The prophet looks beyond this to the heavenly Jerusalem.

6. By virtue of whom are all these sins pardoned? Isa. 53:4, 5.

7. In what are these blessings included? Luke 2:10, 11, 14; Rom. 1:16, 17.

8. What herald should go before this coming Redeemer? Isa. 40:3; Matt. 3:1-3.

9. What work must be done for the people in their own hearts, or be done by the power of the Son of God when he comes to reign? Isa. 40:4; Luke 3:5. See note.

*NOTE* - The figure used is that of the advance guard of an army or king's retinue preparing the literal way before him. It doubtless meant that those who received Christ must put away their traditions, their errors, their sins. When this is not done by the grace of Christ in the hearts of those who accept him, it will be done by his glory when he comes.

10. What should be revealed through Christ? Isa. 40:5.

11. What does Jesus say of himself? John 14:9; 12:32. Ans.â€”That he represents the Father, and therefore, if lifted up, would represent to the world in that lifting up God's love and mercy.

12. What does John say of Christ in this respect? John 1:14.

13. What especial phase of God's glory was manifest in Christ on earth? Eph. 1:6.

14. When will the ultimate glory of Jehovah be revealed through Christ? Matt. 16:27; 25:31.

15. What will this full revelation of glory mean to the people of God? Luke 3:6; 1 Peter 1:5, 7-9.

16. In view of these wonderful promises of the gospel of Christ, what command does God give to his heralds? Isa. 40:6-8.

17. In what does the apostle declare this word is preached? 1 Peter 1:24, 25.

18. What message and spirit should animate the people of God in heralding these tidings? Isa. 40:9, margin. See also Matt. 3:1, 2; John 1:29.

19. What message will precede Christ's second advent? Isa. 40:10, compare with Rev. 22:12.

20. Having all these assurances of the word of God, in what may his people rest? Isa. 40:8; 51:6-8.

21. And what will that same blessed gospel reveal to us through all eternity? Eph. 2:7 and golden text.
