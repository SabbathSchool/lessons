3. For what may we rejoice as that coming draws nigh? Luke 21:28.

4. For what have the children of faith ever looked? Heb. 11:16; 13:14.

*NOTE* - The looking and longing for the continuing city of God is like that of a child longing for its mother, which the New Jerusalem is to the child of God. Gal. 4:26; Isa. 54:5; 62:4. Here the people of God have been pilgrims and strangers, they have seen earth's fairest, strongest cities fall and perish, and the brightest glories of earth fade away; no wonder, then, that they look and long for the haven of rest, where, in the presence of Father and Redeemer, they will "delight themselves in the abundance of peace," in that city which continueth ever. Note the contrast between the "strong city" of God and the "lofty city" of men mentioned in verses 5 and 6 of the lesson scripture.

17. What assurance has the righteous that God regards his faithfulness? Isa. 26:7; Ps. 37:23.

18. What will be the heart longings of those who are looking for Christ's coming? Isa. 26:8, 9.

*NOTE* - This Scripture lesson fixes the time of this song of salvation in connection with the coming of Christ. The characteristics of the people who will be saved at that time are thus expressed: "Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:12. One of God's commandments, namely, the fourth, presents the name, title, and extent of the authority of the Giver of law. The Psalmist (111:4) says that God has "made his wonderful works to be remembered." The fourth commandment and other scriptures show that God has given, as the memorial of his wonderful works, the holy Sabbath. His faithful people will remember this in the last days, and, therefore, in this time of trouble, while longing for his coming, will sing: "Yea, in the way of thy judgments ["highway of thy commandments," Spurrell], O Lord, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance ["memorial," Rev. Ver.] of thee."

19. What is God's "remembrance" (or "memorial," Revised Version)? Ps. 111:4; Ex. 20:8-11.

20. Whom will this lead us to acknowledge? Ans.—The Creator and Redeemer, Christ Jesus our Lord. Col. 1:14-17; Eph. 2:10.

21. How do God's judgments and favor affect men? Isa. 26:9 (last clause), and verse 10.

*NOTE* - It is ever true that the man who is willing, or wills, to do God's will, will be brought to see it. The goodness of God or the judgments of God will bring him to his senses and to repentance; but he whose heart is to do evil, will do evil still. Like Pharaoh, he will harden his heart under God's judgments, or, like Judas, under God's favor. Others will be brought to repentance under God's mercy, like Peter, or under his judgments, like Manasseh. Whichever it may be that comes to us, whether prosperity or calamity, God desires that we shall learn of him righteousness and truth.
