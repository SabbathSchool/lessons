2. How old was Hezekiah when he began to reign? and how long did he reign? 2 Kings 18:2.

3. What was the character of his reign? Verses 3-6.

6. How did God regard him? 2 Kings 18:7, first part.

7. What noted event occurred in the early part of his reign? Verses 9-12.

*NOTE* - Hezekiah seems to have been at least outwardly friendly to Shalmanezer and Sargon, successors to Tiglath-pileser, and to have paid his tribute as a subordinate power. His faith had not yet reached the point of relying on God alone.

8. What did Hezekiah do when he thought himself strong? 2 Kings 18:7, last clause.

*NOTE* - Rawlinson points out that at the time of Sennacherib's accession to the throne nearly all of the kingdoms south and west of Assyria, which had been tributary to that empire, were in open revolt, and Hezekiah seized upon such a time to declare Judah free. He was at this time, however, forced to yield, for he trusted in his own strength and the strength of allied powers, instead of resting wholly upon God. See 2 Chron. 32:1-8 and Isaiah 20. See also on Hezekiah in "Kings of Israel and Judah," by Rawlinson.

9. What action did Sennacherib take with reference to this? Verses 13-16.

*NOTE* - After this victory, according to Assyrian records, Sennacherib returned to Nineveh, where Hezekiah sent his tribute.

12. Who did Rab-shakeh (the cup bearer of the king) say had sent him against Judah? Verse 25.

13. What showed that he not only lied, but that he had no faith whatever in Jehovah? Isa. 36:14, 15, 18, 20.

*NOTE* - Rab-shakeh not only did not go by command of God, but he reproached and blasphemed Jehovah by classing him with the gods of the heathen.

14. How did this boastful chief, with his mighty army, affect Hezekiah? Ans.—Hezekiah humbled himself greatly, sought God in the temple, and sent his leading men clothed in sackcloth to inquire of Isaiah the prophet. See Isa. 37:1-5.

15. How did God regard this humility of soul? Verses 6, 7.

16. As Rab-shakeh departed, what threatening letter did he send to Hezekiah? Verses 9-13.

17. What did Hezekiah do with this blasphemous letter? Verses 14, 15.

18. How did he plead with God? Verses 16-20.

*NOTE* - Hezekiah appealed (1) to God's majesty and omnipotence; (2) to God's honor, which had been insulted; (3) he admitted the truth of all Sennacherib's victories, but exalted God above him; (4) and, lastly, he pleads God's mercy to his people, and asks that the salvation granted may be such that all the nations of earth might know that Jehovah was God alone.

19. What answer did the Lord through his prophet give Hezekiah? Verses 21-35.

*NOTE* - He assured the king of Assyria that the virgin daughter of Zion laughed him to scorn; that as he had blasphemed the Holy One of Israel and reproached the Lord, in whose power was all nations, so would God overcome Assyria, and lead him back as a man would a beast, with a hook in the nose; and that the Lord would defend Jerusalem for his own sake.

20. How did the Lord fight for his people? and what became of this proud king? Verses 36-38.

21. Why did God thus come to the help of Hezekiah? Verse 21.
