# Lesson 8 - August 20, 1892
## The Apostles Persecuted
### Acts 5:17-41 (Memory Verses, 29-32)

**Golden Text**: "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

1. When the high priest and his associates saw the wonderful progress of the gospel, how did they feel and do? Acts 5:17, 18.

**Note**: The first time the apostles were seized, the rulers were "grieved." This time they were "filled with indignation." The apostles had been guilty of contempt of court. They had deliberately disobeyed the orders of the council. The council no doubt thought that they were dealing very mildly with the disciples. They had not done anything to them the first time, but had threatened them, giving them fair warning for the future. In the apostles' persistent preaching they could see nothing but obstinacy, especially as the apostles had plainly said that they would not obey.

2. How did the Lord show that he did not want them in prison? Verses 19, 20.

**Note**: The Lord is the best deliverer and defender. When he has work elsewhere for his servants, he will not allow them to lie in prison. The council wanted the apostles in prison; the Lord wanted them to preach in the temple; so they left the prison as easily as they would have left their own houses. When Paul was in prison at Philippi, the Lord opened it by an earthquake, and let him out. But he left him in prison at Caesarea two whole years, because he wanted him to preach the gospel to Nero at Rome, and the only way that Paul could reach him was as a prisoner.

3. What took place in the morning when the council assembled? Verses 21-23.
4. When the council learned where the apostles were, what did they do? Verses 25-27.
5. What question did they ask them? Verse 28.
6. What reply did the apostles make? Verse 29.
7. What had they already told the council? Acts 4:19, 20.
8. Whom did they at once begin to preach? Acts 5:30.
9. What did they say that God had done for Jesus? Verse 31.
10. What does God through Christ give to men? Ib.
11. Was it only to the Jews that God gave repentance? Acts 11:18.
12. In whom are all the blessings of God contained? Eph. 1:3.
13. To how many is Christ given? John 6:51; Heb. 2:9.
14. Then to how many have God's blessings been given?
15. For what purpose does God give his blessing to men? Acts 3:26.
16. Then how is it that all men are not saved? John 5:40; 1:11, 12.
17. Who did the apostles say were witnesses to the truth they spoke? Acts 5:32.
18. What must a witness always tell?

**Note**: "And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost." A witness must tell only what he knows. No one can know Christ except by his Spirit; therefore no one can be a witness for Christ who has not made his acquaintance through the Spirit.

19. Then what must also always bear witness whenever men really witness to the truth? 1 Peter 1:11; John 15:26.
20. What effect did the apostles' preaching have on the council? Acts 5:33.
21. By whom was their murderous purpose checked? Verse 34.
22. By what argument did he restrain the wrath of the council? Verses 35-39.

**Note**: From this lesson it appears that it is sometimes allowable for a lawyer to plead in behalf of one who is accused on account of the gospel. But God must choose the man. When God moves a lawyer to interest himself in a case, his plea will amount to something. It is very likely that if the apostles had been going to secure the services of a lawyer, they would not have chosen Gamaliel. And if they had, his words would not have had half the weight that they did coming voluntarily and without the knowledge of the apostles. The fact that so learned and conservative a man as Gamaliel would of his own accord intimate the possibility that to persecute those men might be to fight against God, would set some to thinking over the matter.

23. Although the men of the council agreed to Gamaliel's advice, what did their anger lead them to do? Verse 40.
24. How did the apostles receive this? Verse 41.
