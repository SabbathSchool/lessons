# Lesson 13 - September 24, 1892
## The Lord's Supper Profaned
### 1 Cor. 11:20-34 (Memory Verses, none specified)

**Golden Text**: "And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me." 1 Cor. 11:24.

1. What existed in the Corinthian church? 1 Cor. 11:19.
2. As a consequence, were their meetings profitable or otherwise? Verse 17.
3. What was it impossible for them to do while in such confusion? Verse 20, Revised Version.
4. What unseemly actions were indulged in at their professed celebration of the Lord's Supper? Verse 21.
5. Where should bodily hunger be satisfied? Verse 22.
6. Where had the apostles received that which he delivered to the Corinthians? Verse 23.
7. When Jesus, on the night of his betrayal, took bread, what did he say and do? Verses 23, 24.
8. What did he next do? Verse 25.
9. What does the apostle say of this cup and this bread? 1 Cor. 10:16.

**Note**: The Lord's Supper is called the "communion," since Paul declares that it is the communion of the body of Christ. That is, it is the symbol of our oneness with him. Eat and drink Christ by his word (John 6:63), and this is to be done constantly. So the Lord's Supper is only the occasional symbol of a continual feast.

10. Then what must all those be who truly eat the Lord's Supper? 1 Cor. 10:17.
11. In that case can there be any division? 1 Cor. 12:25-27.

13. What did Jesus say of those who do not eat his flesh and drink his blood? John 6:53.
14. In thus acknowledging Christ's death, what else do we also acknowledge? Verse 53; Gal. 2:20.
15. Why should a man examine himself before eating the Lord's Supper? 1 Cor. 11:27, 28.
16. How does one eat and drink unworthily? Verse 29.

**Note**: "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body." Strangely enough, many take this to mean that no man who is not worthy can eat the Lord's Supper. In that case no one could eat it. To eat the Lord's Supper is to feed upon the body of Christ. The eater must discern the Lord's body. Now Christ's body was given for sinners. Rom. 5:6. Christ alone is worthy. The man who comes to the Lord's Supper thinking that he himself is worthy is the one who eats and drinks unworthily, for he does not discern that the Lord's body was a sacrifice for sinners. That man eats and drinks worthily who comes acknowledging that he is nothing, and is not worthy of anything, but that Christ is everything, and that Christ is his.

17. Then in what respect should a man examine himself? 2 Cor. 13:5.

**Note**: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat." This, as indicated above, cannot mean that a man is to take an inventory of his deeds, good and bad, so as to know how worthy he is to eat the Lord's Supper. The Lord does not want men to come as Pharisees. Neither has he abdicated the throne of judgment in favor of any man. He has not constituted a man the judge of his own actions any more than he has made him the judge of other men's actions. For what, then, shall a man examine himself? Paul says, "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith." 2 Cor. 13:5. Let a man believe that Christ is the Saviour of sinners,—and he does not unless he believes that he is his Saviour,—and he will eat and drink worthily.

18. For what purpose did Christ come into the world and die? 1 Tim. 1:15
19. When will the salvation be complete? Heb. 9:28; 1 Peter 1:3-5.
20. Then to what time does the celebration of the Lord's Supper necessarily direct the mind? 1 Cor. 11:26.
