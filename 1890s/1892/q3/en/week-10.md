**Note**: We must not understand that none of the Samaritans had been converted until Peter and John came down, although they had not received the gifts of the Holy Ghost. That was to fit them for work. When Simon saw what the apostles did, he wanted to learn how to impart the same power to others. He saw that if he only had the ability to do what Peter and John did, he could make it exceedingly profitable to himself. But that showed that he did not know the first principles of the gospel. The apostles never received the power until they were completely emptied of self; but he was wholly filled with self. The grace of Christ is to give riches to others, and not to seek it for self. 2 Cor. 8:9. Christ came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. Matt. 20:28. God does not give his Spirit to men to use for their own selfish interest.
