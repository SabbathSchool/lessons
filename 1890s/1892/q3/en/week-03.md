# Lesson 3 - July 16, 1892
## The First Christian Church
### Acts 2:37-47 (Memory Verses, 42-47)

**Golden Text**: "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved." Acts 2:47.

**Introduction**: The title of this lesson is a misnomer. The Christian church antedated Pentecost by many hundred years. In Acts 7:37, 38 we read of the "church in the wilderness" in connection with Moses. And in Heb. 11:24-26 we read that when Moses cast in his lot with the people of God, suffering affliction with them, he was sharing the reproach of Christ. Thus it is clear that believers in the days of Moses constituted the Christian church just as surely as in Peter's time, or today. It was several years after this Pentecost before the disciples were called Christians; but whatever is described by the term had existed for hundreds and even thousands of years. Ever since there have been believers in God and in his power to save through Christ, there has been a Christian church.

1. Give a brief synopsis of Peter's sermon on Pentecost.

**Note**: The student who does not study carefully and thoughtfully Acts 2:22-36 will lose very much of the force of this lesson. Let us briefly summarize Peter's discourse. As seen in last week's lesson, the apostle cited Joel's prophecy as an explanation of what was taking place. Next he referred to the facts of the ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Acts 2:22-24. These he mentioned as well-known events. Then in verses 25-28 he quotes the words of David in Ps. 16:8-11. He shows (verse 29) that this would not apply to David, because he was dead, and his sepulcher was with them till that day. There was no one to whom the words could apply except to Jesus, who was raised from the grave before he saw corruption. Therefore, David was speaking prophetically of the resurrection of Christ. Verses 30-32. In harmony with the words of the Psalmist, Jesus was exalted to the right hand of God, and it was from him that this manifestation of the Spirit had come. Verse 33. Still further it is shown that Christ must be the one referred to, because he had not ascended into the heavens, but in Ps. 110:1 he had said, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." Therefore the irresistible conclusion which produced such sharp conviction was, "God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."

2. What was its effect upon the multitude? Acts 2:37.
3. What question was asked? Ib.
4. What reply did Peter make? Verse 38.
5. What comforting assurance did he give them? Verse 39.
6. How many does the Lord call? Rev. 22:17; Isa. 55:1.
7. Is the whole of Peter's exhortation recorded? Acts 2:40.
8. How was his exhortation received? Verse 41.
9. How many were added to the church as the result? Ib.
10. In what did they continue? Verse 42.
11. How did such power in the church affect the people? Verse 43.
12. How did the believers hold their property? Verse 44.
13. Does this indicate an equal dividing of property among all the believers? Verse 45.

**Note**: "And all that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need." Several reasons might be given to show that this was not a dividing up of the property in the church, so that each member has an equal share, according to the modern communistic idea. It is sufficient, however, to note that believers were being added every day, and such a plan would have involved an inventory and a redistribution every day, which would have been an impossibility. They simply parted with their possessions "as every man had need." It was the natural outgrowth of the Spirit of Christ in the church, making all feel that they were members of the same body. It was the pure unselfishness of Christ. The trouble with modern "anti-poverty" societies is that they try to do arbitrarily and by resolution that which can be accomplished purely by the Spirit of God. They try to produce results without the cause. The results at which they aim are often good, but they cannot be produced in unregenerate, selfish hearts, and no pledge or compact can take selfishness out of the heart.

14. What description is given of the daily conduct of the believers? Verse 46.

**Note**: Many questions will doubtless be asked in regard to the breaking of bread,â€”was it the Lord's Supper? or was it only a common meal? Such questions are useless. All we have is the simple statement that they broke bread from house to house. A child who is old enough to read can tell as much about it as a Doctor of Divinity can; he can reply in the words of Scripture. Innumerable evils have arisen and still arise from guessing at the meaning of texts of Scripture, and expressing an arbitrary opinion.

15. How were they regarded by the people? Verse 47.
16. How often were additions made to their number? See golden text.
