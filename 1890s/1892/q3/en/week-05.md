# Lesson 5 - July 30, 1892
## Peter and John Before the Council
### Acts 4:1-22 (Memory Verses, 8-12)

**Golden Text**: "There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12.

1. What did Peter say in closing his sermon to the people who had gathered around the lame man that was healed? Acts 3:25, 26.
2. While the apostles were speaking, who came upon them? Acts 4:1.
3. What had aroused the priests and Sadducees? Verse 2.
4. What did they do with Peter and John? Verse 3.
5. Nevertheless, what was the effect of the discourse? Verse 4.
6. When the apostles were brought before the council the next day, what question was asked them? Verses 5-7.
7. Whom did Peter have to conduct his case before the council? Verse 8.

**Note**: It is worth while to note carefully the defense which the apostle made when brought before the council. In this, as in each succeeding instance, they simply preached the gospel. They did not act at all as if they were on trial, or as though their lives were in the least danger. One cannot detect the slightest difference between Peter's preaching before the council and his preaching on Pentecost. They had no thought of their own safety. Self did not appear at all. Whenever they were arraigned, they recognized that as an opportunity to preach the gospel to men who would probably never hear it in any other way. There are sincere, candid men in every walk of life. Even in courts where bitter prejudice seems to exist against the truth, there are misguided men who are susceptible to its influence when it is brought before them. But their business absorbs all their time; and from what they have heard about the gospel, they do not think it worth while to go where it is regularly preached. Hence it must be carried to them. Therefore whenever any of God's people are brought into court because of the truth, they should remember that that is God's means of bringing the truth before those men. God has graciously allowed them to be the agency through whom his truth is to be presented to men who would not otherwise be reached.

But only God, who knows the hearts of men, can tell what will reach those men. Therefore he must be allowed to speak in his own way, through his own instrument. He wants to speak through the one whom he has allowed to be brought into court. For that person to secure somebody else to speak for him, is to work directly against God. If he hires another to plead his case, he shows that he does not appreciate the situation. It is not he that is called in question, but God's truth; and it is the truth, and not himself, that is to be defended. And God by his Spirit is to conduct the defense. No matter how humble a man may be, if he is brought into court for the truth's sake, God wants him to bear a testimony there, and he will speak through him. He who created the heavens and the earth is as able to speak through a laboring man as through a scholar, provided that man is acquainted with him. If the man is there solely on the Lord's account, the Lord should be allowed to conduct the case.

8. How much time is it to be supposed that Peter spent preparing the line of argument that he would pursue? Matt. 10:19, 20; Luke 21:12-15.
9. Why was it that the apostles were suffered to be brought before councils? Matt. 10:18.
10. How did Peter answer the question of the council? Acts 4:9, 10.
11. By what name was it that the impotent man stood before them whole? Verse 10.
12. What else is obtained only in that name? Verse 12.
13. From what does it save us? Matt. 1:21.
14. What is sin? 1 John 3:4.
15. Then when a man is saved from sin, from what is he kept? Ans.â€”From transgressing the law.
16. How do all men by nature compare with the impotent man, in their ability to keep the commandments? Rom. 5:6, 8; 7:8; Gal. 5:17.
17. What alone will work righteousness in us? Acts 4:10-12; Eph. 2:10.

**Note**: "By grace are ye saved through faith." Eph. 2:8. Salvation is from sin, and sin is the transgression of the law. If a person is saved from transgressing the law, it necessarily follows that he is made to keep the law. Therefore salvation by faith means righteous acts performed by faith. This is indicated by what follows the verse first quoted in this paragraph. "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." Eph. 2:10. The power of faith to work righteousness, and the reality of that righteousness, are shown by the miracles of healing wrought by faith.

18. How sure may we be that that name will produce actual righteousness, if we have faith in it? Acts 3:16.
19. What did the council perceive from the boldness of Peter and John? Acts 4:13.
20. What could they say in reply to Peter's words? Verse 14.
21. Of what was this a fulfillment? Luke 21:15.
22. What conference did the council have over the matter? Acts 4:15-17.
23. What did the disciples reply to the command laid upon them? Verses 18-20.
24. With what did the council content themselves at this time? Verse 21.
