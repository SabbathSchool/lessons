# Lesson 9 - August 27, 1892
## The First Christian Martyr
### Acts 7:54-60; 8:1-4 (Memory Verses, 57-60)

**Golden Text**: "He kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge." Acts 7:60.

1. What is the subject of the sixth chapter of Acts?
2. What wonderful prominence had Stephen? Acts 6:8-10.
3. When he was brought before the council on a false charge, what did he do?
4. What plainly appeared from his rehearsal of the history of Israel?

**Note**: The whole of Stephen's discourse was calculated to fix the minds of his hearers directly upon Christ. There were also direct references to Christ as in the prophecy of Moses: "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear." He was not pleading for his life, but was preaching the gospel. Indeed, at the close of his discourse the Holy Spirit made him an accuser, plainly showing that his judges were the guilty ones.

5. With what charge did he suddenly terminate his discourse? Acts 7:51-53.
6. Who was it that was thus accusing the judges? Matt. 10:19, 20; Acts 7:55.
7. How did Stephen's words affect the members of the council? Acts 7:54.
8. Where was Stephen's gaze directed? Verse 55.
9. What did he see? Verses 55, 56.
10. What did the angry mob then do? Verses 57, 58.
11. What did Stephen do while he was being stoned? Verse 59.
12. What spirit did he exhibit toward his murderers? Verse 60.

**Note**: While the mob was clamoring for Stephen's life, he was calmly gazing into heaven, entirely lost to all his surroundings. Only for a moment did he seem to take notice of what was going on, and that was to pray for his persecutors. But most wonderfully expressive of perfect indifference to all that was going on around him, and of a soul resting in perfect peace, is the sentence which describes his death,â€”"He fell asleep." The mob was howling with rage; a jargon of sounds appalling to the ordinary ear must have issued from it. Added to this was the pelting of the stones upon Stephen's body. But amid all this noise and tumult, Stephen calmly fell asleep. Happy is the man who is so completely lifted out of and above self.

13. Whose Spirit was thus manifested? Luke 23:34.
14. Who was one of the leaders in the persecution of Stephen? Acts 7:58; 8:1; 22:20.
15. What began with Stephen's death? Acts 8:1.
16. Who was the leader in this persecution? Verse 3; Acts 26:10.
17. How did he feel toward the church? Acts 26:11; Gal. 1:13.
18. What led him to do this? Acts 26:9.
19. Did this persecution succeed in suppressing the gospel? Acts 8:1, 4.

**Note**: Satan thought to put out the fire that had begun to burn so brightly in Jerusalem. The result was that he kindled thousands of others. He scattered the firebrands everywhere. Thus persecution worked out God's plan. If the disciples had stayed in Jerusalem, they would have stagnated. There would not have been enough scope for their activity to keep their piety alive. The church is the salt of the earth, and salt is of no use unless it comes in contact with that which needs preserving.

20. What was thus demonstrated? 2 Cor. 13:8.
