# Lesson 12 - September 17, 1892
## Stephen's Discourse
### Acts 7:2-50 (Memory Verses, none specified)

**Golden Text**: "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." Heb. 8:1.

(In the schedule of the lessons a review is indicated as the lesson for this week; but as Stephen's discourse before the Sanhedrim was entirely omitted in the regular course, it has been thought best to insert a lesson on that subject at this time.)

1. Where was Abraham when God first appeared to him? Acts 7:2.
2. What did God at that time say to him? Verse 3. Compare Gen 12:1-3.
3. To what place did Abraham finally come? Acts 7:4.
4. How much of the land of Canaan did Abraham possess? Verse 5, first part.
5. Yet how much had God promised? Verse 5, last part.
6. By what had that promise been confirmed? Heb. 6:13, 17.
7. Was it possible that God could lie in this matter of the inheritance? Verse 18.
8. Then what conclusion must be drawn from Stephen's statement in Acts 7:5?

**Note**: Stephen's statement in Acts 7:5 most conclusively proves the resurrection. God promised Abraham an inheritance, yet Abraham died without having received a foot of it. But God cannot lie, therefore his promise will be fulfilled, and that means a resurrection for Abraham, and not only for Abraham, but also for all his seed.

9. What, then, did he thus early in his discourse bring vividly before his hearers?

**Note**: In Heb. 11:13 we are told of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that they "all died in faith, not having received the promises." This shows that they did not expect their inheritance in the land of Canaan in this life. This is further shown by the fact that in their lifetime they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. They looked for "an heavenly" country. Heb. 11:16. Moreover, at the very time God made the covenant with Abraham, confirming the promise, he plainly told him that he should die without receiving the inheritance, and that his seed should be in bondage for four hundred years. Gen. 15:13-16.

10. What did God say to Abraham concerning his seed? Acts 7:6, 7.
11. What did he give to Abraham? Verse 8.
12. What was its significance? Rom. 4:11. Compare Gen. 17:7, 8, 11.

**Note**: A few other points about Abraham's inheritance might be noted. The promise included the whole earth. Rom 4:13. It is an everlasting inheritance. Gen. 17:8. Consequently, when Abraham and his seed possess it, they will have everlasting life. The righteous only can possess the inheritance. Rom. 4:13. This is also shown by the fact that circumcision—the sign of righteousness (Rom. 4:11)—was the token of the covenant. Gen. 17:11. Still further, when God first made the promise to Abraham, as well as afterwards (Gen. 12:3; 22:18), he said that in his seed all nations of the earth should be blessed. But in Gal. 3:8 we learn that when God said that, he was preaching the gospel. Therefore the inheritance promised to Abraham and his seed was such as could be obtained only through the gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation through the cross of Christ. Rom. 1:16; 1 Cor. 1:17, 18.

13. What, therefore, was in this also forcibly brought to the attention of the council?
14. What history did Stephen then briefly outline? Acts 7:9-36.
15. In identifying Moses, to what did he again direct their minds? Verse 37.
16. To what conduct of the Israelites did Stephen next refer? Verses 39-43.

**Note**: "But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham," etc. When God delivered Israel from Egypt, it was to fulfill the promise to Abraham. But that, as we have seen, meant everlasting life in the new earth. That this was what God had in view is corroborated by the fact that the Israelites could not enter Canaan until they were sinless. After they crossed the Jordan, they were all circumcised—the sign of righteousness by faith—and the Lord said, "This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Josh. 5:9. Jericho was taken by faith. Heb. 11:30. But Ai could not be taken because there was sin in the camp, showing that when Jericho was taken all the people had the righteousness of faith. This fact was in itself sufficient to show the Jews the nature of the inheritance that God gave to Israel, and who should possess it. Although God gave the children of Israel the inheritance, they departed from the faith, and so did not go on to possess the land. Read Psalm 81. Of this apostasy Stephen speaks in Acts 7:39-43.

17. What is contrasted with the tabernacle of Moloch? Acts 7:44.
18. Why is it called the tabernacle of witness?

**Note**: Reference to the tabernacle of Moloch naturally led to the mention of the "tabernacle of witness," which the fathers brought into the land with Joshua, and which afterwards gave place to the temple of Solomon. It was doubtless called the "tabernacle of witness" because its chief use was to contain the ark, in which was the law of God, which was a "testimony" and a "witness" against the children of Israel. Ex. 25:21; Deut. 31:26. But neither the tabernacle nor the temple of Solomon could be a dwelling-place for God. Solomon himself, in his prayer at the dedication of the temple, recognized the fact that his temple could not contain God. 2 Chron. 6:18. The fact that God made all things is sufficient to show that no man can make a house that will be a fit dwelling-place for him. Acts 7:48, 49; Isa. 66:1, 2. This necessarily led to the conclusion that he dwells in a temple made without hands; and that was so suggestive of the conclusion that Jesus is the high priest in that heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 8:1) that the council could stand no more.

19. What did Stephen say of its history? Acts 7:45-47.
20. What did he say about God's dwelling-place? Verses 48, 49; Isa. 66:1, 2.
21. What must the council have seen as the evident conclusion of Stephen's argument? Heb. 8:1.
