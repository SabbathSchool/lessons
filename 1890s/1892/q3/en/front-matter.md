# Lessons from the Acts of the Apostles

## FOR SENIOR CLASSES

### July 2 to September 24, 1892

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

These lessons are designed to be merely suggestive, to aid the earnest student in his search for truth. It should be understood that the lesson is in the Bible, and not in this book. The questions and notes in this little book are intended only as helps in the study of the lesson. That which should be carefully studied first of all is the scripture indicated as the subject. Get familiar with it, and then use the suggestions in the lesson book. It will be noticed that there are often extended notes, to which there is in some cases no reference. The use of these depends upon the teacher. They may be used to extend the lesson to any length desired, or, if time does not allow, the attention may be confined more closely to the text. It is recommended, however, that the subjects discussed in the notes, and the scriptures cited, be carefully studied.
