NOTE.â€”Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe," naming several. And again, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father." What greater works can be done it is impossible to say; but we have the word of Christ that they shall be done. Those who ask, "Why don't we see some miracles, if they are to be in the church till the end of time?" do not realize that in every age the gifts of the Spirit have been manifested in the church, although often to a limited extent. But if it is asked why miracles are not so common now as in the first century, we can only reply by pointing to the conditions. When the same devotion, unselfishness, faith, and zeal are seen among believers, then the same power may be expected to be seen in the church.
