NOTE.â€”It was not because of fear that the apostles fled from one city to another when they were persecuted, as is shown by the fact that they returned over the same road. After Paul was stoned, he went back into the city, and when they had finished their missionary tour, they went back over every city that they had visited. They fled because they were driven away, and could not at that time do anything more in those places. The slight reference, also, that is made to the stoning of Paul, contains a wonderful lesson, more expressive than anything else could be. What a rebuke for those of us who are inclined to make a great ado over even a little slight or reproach that comes to us in the line of our work. It can be explained only by remembering that Paul had in him the mind of Christ (see Phil. 2:5-7; John 4:34; 2 Cor. 8:9; Heb. 2:1, 2), and esteemed all these things as light afflictions (2 Cor. 4:16-18).
