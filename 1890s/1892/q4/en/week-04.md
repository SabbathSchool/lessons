NOTE.â€”If anyone thinks that the Jews would certainly have known it if their Scriptures had taught that the Lord was as anxious for the salvation of other people as he was for the salvation of the Jews, let him remember how impossible it was for the disciples to grasp the idea that Christ was going to die, which was not only contained in the Scriptures, but was plainly and repeatedly declared to them by the Saviour in person. It needed this outpouring of the Spirit upon the Gentiles to convince the disciples that God is no respecter of persons. But God is always the same, therefore he was never any respecter of persons. So it was always true that "in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him." Peter's tardy recognition of the truth did not make it a new thing with God.
