# Lesson 13 - December 24, 1892
## THE QUESTION SETTLED - ACTS 15:12-31
(Memory Verse, Acts 15:11)

### GOLDEN TEXT: "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good." 1 Thess. 5:21.

1. Tell what led to the conference in Jerusalem.

2. What was the importance of the question?

3. Give Peter's argument in the case.

4. When Peter had finished, what did Barnabas and Paul tell? Acts 15:12.

5. Who spoke next? Verse 13.

6. To what did he refer? Verse 14.

7. To whom did he refer as authority for their preaching to the Gentiles? Verse 15.

8. What prophecy did he specify? Verses 16, 17; Amos 9:11, 12.

9. How long had God had it upon his mind to save the Gentiles? Acts 15:18.

NOTE.—The facts concerning the Gentiles were arguments that could not be overcome. God had abundantly blessed the labor that had been done among them, as shown by Peter and Paul and Barnabas. This showed that God was not only willing to save the Gentiles, but that he would save them by simple faith. When God poured out his Spirit upon them, so that they spoke with tongues, no one who reverenced the Lord could say that there was something still lacking that the Gentiles must do before they could be saved. That the salvation of the Gentiles was not a new thing in God's plan is shown by the promises to Abraham, by the prophecy of Amos, which James quoted, by Joel 2:28, by Isa. 45:22, 23; 49:6; 60:1-5, etc.

10. What, therefore, was James' decision in the case? Acts 15:19.

11. What did he suggest that they should write to the Gentile converts? Verse 20.

NOTE.—The four things specified in the letter to the brethren are declared by the Spirit to be "necessary things." They are as necessary now as they were when written, and had been necessary from the beginning. The blood is the life (Gen. 9:4, 5), and therefore the prohibition against it comes under the sixth commandment. The prohibition against things strangled comes in the same list. The relation of the other things to the law of God is obvious. These things, being forbidden by the law of God, are consequently inconsistent with the life of Christ, for his life is the law in its perfection.

12. Why was it not necessary to specify more particularly the things that pertain to the Christian life? Verse 21.

NOTE.—It should be understood that the apostles did not lay these four necessary things upon the disciples in addition to their faith in Christ. These things were specified only because they were things that people from among the heathen would not so readily perceive as necessarily embraced in the Christian life. Fornication was among the heathen a commonplace affair, and even required by their religion. The eating of blood was a common thing. Everything in ordinary life was so immediately connected with idolatry that it was necessary for the converts from among the heathen to be especially on their guard to avoid pollution of idols. These things, in which the Gentile converts might sin without realizing it, so common were they, were especially noted, but it was necessary for the apostles to go further into particulars concerning the Christian life, for the disciples had constant access to the writings of Moses, in which the Christian life is set forth, for he wrote of Christ. John 5:46, 47.

13. Why was it necessary to specify even these?

NOTE.—One point may be referred to as showing that, in setting forth the law, Moses was describing Christ, through whom alone the righteousness of the law is fulfilled. In Deut. 30:11-14 Moses, after having set forth the law, says: "For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it." But in Rom. 10:5-9 Paul tells us that this refers to Christ. This was not left obscure by Moses, so that the Jews would think that the commandment must be kept by them apart from Christ, for just before the verses quoted Moses tells them that God would circumcise their heart to keep his law (Deut. 30:6, 8), and just afterward he said, "That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days." Deut. 30:20.

14. Were these things of minor importance? Verses 28, 29.

15. Are these things to be observed in these days as well as then?

16. What steps did the brethren take to relieve the minds of the new converts who had been troubled? Verses 22, 23.

17. What commendation was given to Barnabas and Paul? Verses 25, 26.

18. What did the apostles agree was evidently the work of Barnabas and Paul? Gal. 2:7-9.

19. How was the result of the conference received by the brethren at Antioch? Acts 15:30, 31.

NOTA BENE.—The teacher and scholar will please note that there are fourteen Sabbaths in this quarter and but thirteen lessons. But as there are but twelve Sabbaths next quarter, and thirteen lessons will be provided, it has been thought best to have the lesson of December 31 counted as the first lesson of the first quarter of 1893. This will not disarrange our schools or record books, and is the easiest way to dispose of this transient irregularity.—EDITOR B. S. L.
