NOTE.â€”The fact that Herod was not able to keep Peter in prison, shows that he did not have it in his power to grant him any favors. He who has no power to punish, has no power to protect. But the power of Herod represents the power of all civil governments. God's people have nothing to receive of them, and should ask them for nothing. Peter could do much more for Herod than Herod could do for Peter. Even while Peter was in prison, Herod might well have sought his protection. "The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them," and they who have that protection need no other. Indeed, if they seek any other, they thereby tend to deprive themselves of that, for by so doing they show their lack of faith in the Lord's protection. The Lord says, "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help." Ps. 146:3. "Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God; which made heaven, and earth." Verses 5, 6.

But it may be said that God uses civil rulers to accomplish his purposes. That is true, and he alone knows how and when to use them. None of them have any power over his people except as he gives it to them. John 19:11. Therefore, if he allows them to be put to death, as in the case of Stephen and James, they may know that it is his will. "He giveth his beloved sleep." And if the Lord has work still for his servants to do, they may rest confident that there is not power enough in the world to keep them in prison.
