## The Way of the Righteous

### Memory Verses: Psalm 1:1-6

**Golden Text**: "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." Psalm 1:1

1. With what does the book of Psalms open? Ps. 1:1, first word.

   **Note**—The first psalm has no title in the original, as have most of the others. It was, doubtless, written by David. It opens, as does also the book, of course, with a benediction. The word translated "blessed" is in the plural, denoting "blessednesses," and, according to some scholars, could well be translated, "Oh, the blessednesses [or happinesses] of the man!" etc., including all blessings of God's grace. It is well to notice that this blessing is based solely on character.

2. Upon whom is such blessing pronounced? Verse 1.

3. What is the first step generally taken in wickedness? Verse 1, first clause.

   **Note**—Walking in "the counsel of the ungodly," imitating their ways, seeking their advice and help, are generally the first steps in backsliding from God. But the man who is blessed of God does not "walk" in the counsel of the ungodly; his counsel comes from God. See 2 Tim. 2:22.

4. What would naturally follow to him who walked in the counsel of the ungodly? Ps. 1:1, second clause.

   **Note**—From heeding the counsel of the ungodly, from occasionally following their advice, a person comes at last to stand in the way of sinners. He deliberately chooses the "trodden path" of those who transgress God's law.

5. What would be the third stage of sin? Verse 1, third clause.

   **Note**—The man who departs from God at first walks in the counsel of the ungodly, those who know not God, till he deliberately chooses to stand, or, as given by some, "to tread" in the way (the "trodden path") of sinners, till at last the heart becomes hardened, and he takes his seat among those who openly deride and scoff at that which is good and pure and true; he chooses the assembly of mockers as his companions.

6. What leads to this hardness of heart? Heb. 3:13.

7. With whom alone does the counsel of life rest? Isa. 28:29.

8. What is the character of the counsels of God? Isa. 25:1; 28:29.

9. What will be the end of those who despise the counsel of God? Prov. 1:29-32.

10. What does the Psalmist say of the ungodly? Ps. 1:4.

11. What are we assured of those who put their dependence in such? Jer. 17:5, 6.

12. What is said of their final end? Ps. 1:5, last clause of verse 6.

13. Who only will stand in the judgment? Ps. 24:3, 4. Only those who have formed a right character.

14. Through whom alone is such a character attained? 1 Cor. 1:30; John 5:24.

15. What change takes place in the heart of a man thus blessed? Eze. 36:26.

16. How will he regard God's law? Verse 27; Ps. 1:2.

17. To what is the Christian growth of such a man likened? Verse 3; Jer. 17:7, 8.

18. What promise does God give to those who have sinned against him if they will but put away their sins and seek him with the whole heart? Isa. 58:8, 11.

19. What does he say of his prosperity? Ps. 1:3, last clause.

20. Can even the persecutions to which the people of God have been always subject be said to be prosperity or for their good? Rom. 8:35-37, 28.
