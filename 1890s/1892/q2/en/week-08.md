# Lesson 8 - May 21, 1892

## Daniel and His Companions

### Memory Verses: Daniel 1:17-19

**Golden Text**: "Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank." Daniel 1:8

**Introduction**—The time covered by this lesson was 606 to 603 B.C. Jeremiah (25:1) says it was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim; Daniel says (1:1), in the third year of the same king. It is supposed that Jeremiah followed the Jewish mode of reckoning, counting a part of an unfinished year the whole year, even though that part consisted of only a few months. Jehoiakim reigned two full years and parts of two other years, counted as years by Jeremiah. Daniel followed the Assyrian mode, which began the reign of any king from the next new year after his accession to the throne. For instance, if a new king's reign should begin in August, the old king's reign would be continued in the chronological accounts till the new year came, and then the reign of the new king would begin. Thus both Jeremiah and Daniel are correct. The place of our lesson was Babylon, a great city, then in the height of its power, 500 miles east of Jerusalem, in the valley of the Euphrates.

1. Because of the folly of Hezekiah what prediction did the Lord make concerning that king's seed? Isa. 39:5-7.

2. Who among these did Nebuchadnezzar choose for the purpose of giving them an education in the affairs of state? Dan. 1:3, 4.

   **Note**—Mark the character of those chosen. The word "children" is "youths" in Revised Version.

3. What daily provision was made for their physical needs? Verse 5, first part.

   **Note**—The word "meat" simply means "food." This use is quite common in England now. It is used in America in speaking of the kernel of a nut.

4. For how long were they to be thus taught and nourished? Same verse, last part.

5. What ones who afterward became noted were among these youths of Israel? Verse 6.

6. What change did Ashpenaz make in the names of these young men? Verse 7.

   **Note**—Evidently the king designed by this sumptuous fare, the great pains taken with them, and the flattering names given to them, to win them from their own religion to that of Babylon. As their own names brought to their mind the God of Israel, so the names given them connected them with heathen gods. Daniel meant "God is my judge," or "God's judge;" Hananiah, "whom Jehovah graciously gave;" Mishael, "who is what God is;" Azariah, "whom Jehovah aids." Their names given by Nebuchadnezzar were Belteshazzar, "favored by Bel;" Shadrach, "command of Aku (the moon-god);" Meshach, Peloubet says, "perhaps connected with Mas, a protecting genius or demigod;" Abed-nego, "servant of Nebo."

7. What course did Daniel and his companions take with reference to the food furnished from the royal table? Verse 8.

   **Note**—The food furnished Daniel might have been objectionable to him for several reasons: (1) It might have been contrary to the law of God (Leviticus 11); (2) it might not have been properly cleansed from blood (Lev. 17:10); (3) it might have been offered to idols; (4) it might have been rich and unhealthful (Prov. 23:1-3). The wine was doubtless intoxicating, and he remembered the words of the Lord through his royal progenitor. Prov. 23:29-32.

8. By what were they tempted?

   **Note**—"They were tempted: (1) By appetite; the love of the king's luxuries and wine. (2) By their ambitions and hopes of success. How could they expect to succeed with a heathen king, when they were so set in a religion which condemned him and his conduct? (3) By the king's command. Why should they not yield to it as to an inevitable necessity—their very life might depend upon it. (4) By the love of prosperity. Their course would make them appear odd, and subject them to ridicule, and bring them into many troubles."—Peloubet. Many Christians professing to be looking for Christ's coming yield principle under much lighter temptations.

9. How had God already begun to work for Daniel? Dan. 1:9; see Gen. 39:21-23.

10. What reply did the prince of the eunuchs make? Dan. 1:10.

11. How fairly did Daniel present the matter? Verses 11-13.

    **Note**—Pulse, "grain, vegetables, herbs, opposed to flesh and more delicate food."—Gesenius. "Esculent seeds of leguminous plants, such as beans, peas, lentils."—Century Dictionary. The Hebrew word means "seeds."

12. What did God move Melzar (the steward) to decide? Verse 14.

13. What was the result of the trial? Verses 15, 16.

14. How did God regard the integrity and faith of these young men? Verse 17, first part.

15. What special favors did he show Daniel? Same verse, last part.

16. What did the king find in comparing them with the others who had taken this three years' course of training? Verses 18, 19.

17. What position did he give them because of this? Verse 19, last clause. They were made officers and advisers of responsibility. See Gen. 41:46.

18. How did the king find them as compared with all the wise and great men of his kingdom? Dan. 1:20.

19. What is said of Daniel's continuance? Verse 21.

    **Note**—He lived longer than this, but this date is mentioned as the time when God's people were delivered. There are few Old Testament characters more worthy of study and imitation than Daniel, "greatly beloved" of God. The secret of his life is shown in his faithfulness and integrity in what many would call a small thing, the mere matter of diet. God, however, vindicated his course and left us his example. Daniel knew that sacrifice or compromise of principle was not a small matter; he could not afford it; neither can any Christian.

    "Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone, 
    Dare to have a purpose firm, dare to make it known."
