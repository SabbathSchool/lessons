## Messiah's Reign

### Memory Verses: Psalm 72:7-8

**Golden Text**: "All kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him." Psalm 72:11

**Introduction**—From the title, the introduction, and the close of this psalm, it would seem that it was written by David, a prayer for his son Solomon, who had just ascended the throne, and, through Solomon, predictive of Him, the "Greater than Solomon." The prediction of Christ's reign is colored, or combined, or coalesced, with the royal Psalmist's prayer for his son. The Revised Version gives as an alternative reading of "he shall," and "they shall," "let him," "let them," etc., throughout the psalm. This would make it a prayer instead of a prediction. In either case the psalm is true of "great David's Greater Son." Solomon is a twofold type of Christ, or, rather, a type of Christ in two different phases of his work: (1) In building the literal temple of the Lord as Christ builds on his Father's throne the spiritual temple (Zech. 6:12, 13; Eph. 2:20, 21); (2) in his peaceful reign over the typical promised land after his father had put down all enemies, even as Christ reigns in peace forever in his own kingdom after the Father hath put all foes under his feet (Ps. 110:1). The work and reign of Christ in both phases are presented in this psalm.

1. What prayer does David make for Solomon? Ps. 72:1.

2. Having God's righteousness, how would he judge the people, and what would be their condition? Verses 2, 3.

3. How much more true is this of Christ and his subjects? Verses 4-7; Isa. 11:3 and first clause of verse 4.

4. How great was the dominion of Solomon? 1 Kings 4:21.

5. Over how much of the earth will Christ's kingdom extend? Ps. 72:8.

6. What is said of his enemies? Verse 9; Isa. 11:4, last part; Rom. 14:11, 12.

7. What is said of the homage which shall be rendered to him, and of his character? Ps. 72:10-14.

   **Note**—When this universal homage of Christ is referred to, as it is in several places in the Scriptures, it is not to be understood that all the earth will be converted, and that all kings will yield him willing worship and service. The entire reign of Christ as king, and his great love and pity for his people, manifested throughout the whole of probation, are shown in this psalm. It is true that an unnumbered throng will accept of Christ by faith. Rev. 7:9. It is true that when Christ appears, and the wicked dead are raised to be judged, everyone will not only bow before him in the abject and feigned homage of fear and terror (Ps. 66:3, margin; 18:44, margin), but they will also humble themselves before the people of God, whom they have despised (Rev. 3:9). It is true that the wicked will be destroyed root and branch. Mal. 4:1; Obadiah 16, and many other places. It is true that all who are then left "will be all righteous," and will with willing hearts serve Christ forever. Isa. 60:20, 21; Rev. 5:13; 21:24.

8. How were these blessings fulfilled in part to King Solomon? 2 Chron. 9:1-9, 20-28.

9. What is further predicted of Christ? Ps. 72:15.

   **Note**—The Revised Version reads: "And they [those whom Christ saves] shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; and men shall pray for him continually; they shall bless him all the day long." If this be the correct reading, it would seem to have reference to the life which Christ gives through his righteousness to all who trust in him, both here and hereafter. The prayers would be the prayers of saints offered to Christ as High Priest, the prayers perhaps for his coming, and the continual praise which is now offered to him, and will be throughout eternity. If the proper reading is, "He shall live," it would have reference to the eternal triumph of Christ over death. "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him." Rom. 6:9; see also Rev. 1:18. The giving of the gold of Sheba has no doubt some reference to the generous gifts of the people of God in this life, which has been fulfilled in every land and age where the gospel has been preached. It will be preeminently fulfilled in the earth made new. See Rev. 21:24.

10. What is said of the abundance of Christ's graces and kingdom? Ps. 72:16; Isa. 55:12, 13.

    **Note**—The Revised Version translates Ps. 72:16 as follows: "There shall be abundance of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon; and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth." Boothroyd translates: "Abundance of corn shall be on the ground; on the tops of the mountains its crops shall rustle like the trees that grow on Lebanon; and citizens shall flourish as the grass of the earth." This may denote the abundant blessings of the gospel as well as those of the new earth.

11. What is said of the name of this king? Ps. 72:17, first two clauses; see margin, and Acts 4:12; Jer. 23:6.

12. What will come to man through him? Ps. 72:17, last two clauses; Gen. 22:17, 18.

13. Through what do all these blessings come? Gal. 3:8; Rom. 1:16, 17.

14. How far is that gospel to reach? Rev. 14:6, 7.

15. How broad and ample are its provisions? Rom. 10:12, 13.

16. What is said of the condition and blessings of those who bear these glad tidings to the world? Isa. 6:5-8; Rom. 10:15.

17. How should we feel toward God for the inestimable privilege of being coworkers with him in advancing his kingdom? Ps. 72:18, 19.
