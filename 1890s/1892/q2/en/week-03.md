# Lesson 3 - April 16, 1892

## God's Works and Word

### Memory Verses: Psalm 19:7-11

**Golden Text**: "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul." Psalm 19:7

### God in His Works

1. In what does the Psalmist say are the manifestations of God? Ps. 19:1.

2. How frequently are God's glory and handiwork thus manifested? Verse 2.

3. How far-reaching is this instruction? Verses 3, 4; Rom. 10:18.

4. What responsibility does this revelation place upon man? Rom. 1:19, 20.

   **Note**—It has been well said that the manifestation of God in the works of nature is his great primary school, day school and night school, and universal primary day and night school.

5. How may it be said that man is left without excuse by the revelation which God makes of himself in his works?

   **Note**—God's works—the glory and beauty of the heavens and the earth—proclaim a Being of infinite power, knowledge, wisdom, and glory. But a Being who is infinite in power and wisdom and knowledge must be infinite also in justice and mercy (or love, the combination of all goodness) so that a reflective soul desiring to know more of God would be led "from nature up to nature's God."

6. How does the Psalmist describe the most glorious of God's work manifest to us? Ps. 19:4-6.

7. Of what is the sun the great source to us? Ans.—Of light and heat, a symbol of the light and life from God, warming, blessing all.

### God in His Word or Law

8. What must reflect the character of a government? Ans.—The law, for it is the kind of laws and their enforcement which make a government what it is.

9. What is said of the law of the Lord? Ps. 19:7, first clause.

10. Can that which is perfect be amended?

11. What is the effect of the law on the soul? Verse 7, first part.

    **Note**—The law restores the soul by revealing the right way, pointing out its sin (1 John 3:4; Rom. 7:7) and need of a Saviour, and so leads to conversion. See Gal. 3:22, 23.

12. What is a second characteristic of God's law? Ps. 19:7, last part.

    **Note**—"Testimony" means witness. God's law is the witness of his character, and also witnesses to the righteousness of Christ in us. Rom. 3:21. This (as well as all other kindred terms used in this connection) refers to the Decalogue. See Ex. 25:16.

13. What effect does the witness of God have upon the simple? Ps. 19:7, last part; 119:98-100.

    **Note**—This witness is "sure;" it will never fail; it can be depended upon forever. "Amen" is derived from the same word. It makes wise the simple, not the foolish, but the ignorant who desire to know.

14. What third characteristic and result of God's law is mentioned? Ps. 19:8, first part; 119:111, 128.

    **Note**—"Statutes" (Revised Version "precepts"), appointments, charges, which God has given. They are right and right alone, and hence the converted heart rejoices that it has found the right way.

15. What is the fourth characteristic of God's law? and what is its effect? Ps. 19:8, last part; 12:6.

16. What is the fifth characteristic of that law and its effect? Ps. 19:9, first part.

    **Note**—"Fear," that which demands reverence is applied to the great and holy law of God's love, which demands on the part of the soul that reverence for God which is the beginning of wisdom. See Job 28:28; Prov. 1:7. God's law endures forever. Ps. 111:7, 8.

17. What sixth characteristic and its effect are noted? Ps. 19:9, last part; 119:160.

18. What effect do all these qualities have upon the converted soul? Ps. 19:10.

    **Note**—The testimony of this psalm to the law of God is the universal testimony of the entire Bible. The law of God, like its Author, is perfect, sure, right, clean, true, and righteous altogether, and, says Paul, holy, just, good, spiritual. Rom. 7:12, 14. There is only one reason why we should hate God's law, and that is the possession of the carnal mind. Rom. 8:7.

19. By what means and by whom may we be brought to love God's law? Rom. 1:16, 17; Eze. 36:26, 27.

20. What question does the Psalmist ask? and what petition does he offer? Ps. 19:12.

    **Note**—Secret faults, faults not seen or realized by himself.

21. Who only knows the heart? and by what agency does God reveal it to us? Jer. 17:9, 10; Ps. 19:11, first part; Rom. 7:7.

22. From what sins does David earnestly pray to be kept? Ps. 19:13.

    **Note**—Presumptuous sins seem to be set opposite the secret faults, or, rather, secret faults and presumptuous sins make up the sum total of all sin. Presumptuous sins are sins committed knowing them to be wrong, presuming on God's mercy, or thinking that God is not particular. They may exist in all degrees, from slight departures from God to the utmost defiance, as was the case in Num. 15:30, 31. See, also, Lev. 10:1, 2; 2 Sam. 6:3-7. We may commit secret faults without a violation of conscience, because we do not know we have them, although others may. But we cannot commit known sins without presuming on God's mercy and benumbing our conscience; and in stupefying conscience we fall rapidly till we commit much transgression. Let us continually pray that such sins may not have dominion over us. One of the most blessed of friends is a conscience made and kept tender by the Spirit of God.

23. What, on the other hand, is said of keeping God's commandments? Ps. 19:11; Rev. 22:14.

    **Note**—There is not only a reward for keeping, as is implied in the last scripture, but there is a reward in keeping them, in doing God's will by the grace of Christ, in walking with him.

24. What should be the daily prayer of every heart? Ps. 19:14.
