## The Prayer of the Penitent

### Memory Verses: Psalm 51:10-13

**Golden Text**: "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right [constant] spirit within me." Psalm 51:10

**Introduction**—The title to this psalm doubtless gives its origin, but it is adapted to sinners of every age and clime. It expresses the condition of a soul truly humble and penitent.

1. On what basis does David plead God's mercy? Ps. 51:1, first part.

2. Through what alone may we obtain pardon? Titus 3:5-7.

3. On what ground did David plead that the record of his sin might be blotted out or wiped away? Ps. 51:1, last part.

   **Note**—Mark the gradations, "mercy," "loving-kindness," "multitude of God's tender mercies." Have compassion, pity, tenderness toward me, not in stinted measure, for my sin is great, but according to thy loving-kindness, even to blot out my transgressions (which are many) "according to the multitude of thy tender mercies." The sinner's large plea for God's undeserved mercy shows a large conception of his sin.

4. Does the truly penitent wish to retain any of his sin? Verse 2.

   **Note**—Some versions have "t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h-l-y," while the English versions have "t-h-r-o-u-g-h-l-y." They both mean the same. The latter is the older form. The word means "through and through."

5. On what condition does God forgive sin? 1 John 1:9.

6. Did David meet these conditions? Ps. 51:3.

7. How did he regard his sin as related to God? Verse 4, first part.

   **Note**—It is said that the Hebrew manner of expression includes and swallows up all lesser things in the greater, so that David's sin against God was so great that it shut the other sins from his sight, so to speak. Another way of looking at the text is this: David as king could be called to account by no one save God, hence his sin was against God as his sovereign. But in whatever way the Psalmist used the expression as regards the particular wrongs done to Uriah the Hittite, the only true sorrow for sin is that when the sinner considers the greatest sin of all as committed against God.

8. What acknowledgment does he make as to God's justice? Verse 4.

9. By what does he show that he recognizes the root of his sin? Verse 5.

   **Note**—He who fails to realize that mortal flesh is essentially depraved, and that only the power of God within can overcome the weaknesses and passions of the flesh, will be defeated by the enemy. See Rom. 7:14-24; 8:2, 3. David recognized, as every sinner should, not only the enormity of his particular sin, but the inherent depravity of the natural man. There is no reflection against his parents; the words are true of every soul of man.

10. How does God desire truth to affect man? Ps. 51:6; 15:2.

11. What would the possession of this truth and wisdom within do for David? Prov. 3:13; Ps. 111:10.

12. How does David continue to plead with God in regard to sin? Ps. 51:7, 8.

    **Note**—It will be seen by reference to Lev. 14:3-7 that the purging of hyssop was not merely the cleansing, it was an authoritative acquittal, or pronouncement that the man was clean. David desires to be made perfectly clean; he wants God's complete acquittal. He desires to rejoice in the sentence of acquittal. His spiritual fall he likens to a physical fall in which the bones have been broken; he wants perfect healing from his fall.

13. How does he plead that God will regard his sins? Ps. 51:9.

14. What alone can hide our sins from God? Rom. 3:22; 4:6, 7.

15. Is it simply forgiveness alone that the truly penitent desires? Ps. 51:10, margin.

16. By what power are the new heart and spirit given? 2 Cor. 5:17; Eze. 36:26.

17. Whose spirit is then within us? and how does it affect us? Rom. 8:9; Eze. 36:27.

18. Whose companionship does the truly repentant long for? Ps. 51:11.

19. What great boon does he reask of God? Verse 12, first part.

20. Is God willing to do this? 1 John 2:1, 2; Micah 7:18, 19.

21. How only did David expect to walk at liberty, or be kept from falling? Ps. 51:12; see 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:57, 58.

22. What is the result of the indwelling of the Spirit of God in the hearts of men? Ps. 51:13; Isa. 6:7, 8; see John 1:40, 41, 43, 45.

23. May we know that God will hear such prayers as David offered? Ps. 51:16, 17; Isa. 57:15.
