# Lesson 10 - June 4, 1892

## The Fiery Furnace

### Memory Verses: Daniel 3:16-18

**Golden Text**: "When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Isaiah 43:2

**Introduction**—The date of this lesson is not certain, but was probably about 580 B.C., after Nebuchadnezzar had completed his conquest of surrounding nations, as predicted by Jeremiah (27:2-8). The place was the plain of Dura, about five miles southeast of Babylon. There is a huge mound of brick there at the present time, about seven yards high, which Offert believes to be the base, or pedestal, of the great image.

1. What idolatrous act did Nebuchadnezzar perform when established in his empire? Dan. 3:1.

   **Note**—The height of this image was ninety feet, its breadth nine feet. The height probably included that of the pedestal, and, covered with gold plates, could be seen a great distance. It was, doubtless, an image of the protecting divinity of Babylon, Bel-Merodach. The word translated "image" means the image of a man.

2. What decree did he make? Verses 2-7.

3. What complaint came to the king in reference to this decree? Verses 8-12.

   **Note**—The Hebrews were accused by the learned Chaldeans. Doubtless they felt envious because the Hebrews were placed above them.

4. What was then done? Verse 13.

5. What question did Nebuchadnezzar ask them? Verse 14.

   **Note**—Nebuchadnezzar wished to give the Hebrews a fair trial and all the benefit of any doubt. "Is it of purpose," he asked (see margin), "that you did this."

6. What alternative did he set before them? Verse 15.

7. What insult did he offer God? Same verse, last part. See similar boasting in Isa. 37:10-13.

8. What time to consider their reply did the three men wish? Dan. 3:16.

   **Note**—"We are not careful," Revised Version, "We have no need." It was a matter of principle, and, as the principle of right was in their heart, they desired no time. They might have taken time and reasoned: (1) It is only for once, and that will not change our characters; (2) we will still hold our own religion at heart; (3) the king, too, ought to be obeyed; God has made him ruler (Jer. 27:6-8), and, of course, we ought to be "subject to the higher powers," as God has ordained; (4) Nebuchadnezzar had befriended them, and, of course, they ought not to displease him; (5) their lives were at stake, and they might do as their fathers had done before them; (6) if they refused to obey, they would die, but if they yielded, they would live, and how much more good they could then do as rulers in that idolatrous nation. These and other vain excuses might have been urged by these faithful men. But they took the only safe way. They neither parleyed with the enemy, nor did they wish time to consider a matter of right or wrong. They could die, but could not yield. Compromise was sin, and right can never compromise with wrong and remain right.

9. What faith in God did they express? Verse 17.

10. But if it were not God's will to deliver them, what was their choice? Verse 18.

    **Note**—They had faith to be saved from trial, in trial, by trial, whatever and whichever way God thought best. For him they could stand alone, but God stands with them. When we stand for God, he stands with us.

11. How did their reply affect the king? and what did he command? Verses 19, 20.

12. How was the command executed? Verses 21, 23.

13. How were the strong men affected who cast them into the furnace? Verse 22.

14. What revelation was immediately made to the king? Verses 24, 25.

    **Note**—The better translation of the term rendered "Son of God" is, doubtless, that of the Revised Version, "a son of the gods." Nebuchadnezzar, a heathen, did not know Christ; and yet it was Christ who was with them. They were with him in the right; he was with them in the suffering.

15. What did the king immediately do? Verses 26, 27.

16. What acknowledgment did Nebuchadnezzar make? Verse 28. He acknowledged their honesty, integrity, and righteousness.

17. What decree did he issue? Verse 29.

    **Note**—Little did these men know what would be the outcome of their simple faith, that it would be the means of having the knowledge of the great God carried throughout that mighty empire in royal decree, by royal heralds. They decided for God irrespective of consequences. God used their simple faith to enlighten the world. It is always thus.

18. What was done with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego? Verse 30.

19. What promise of God was exemplified in the case of these men? Golden text.

20. By what power were they kept from sinning against God? Ps. 17:4; 119:11.

21. How will persecutions always result if faithfully borne? Phil. 1:12.
