## A Song of Praise

### Memory Verses: Psalm 103:1-5

**Golden Text**: "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits." Psalm 103:2

1. To what extent did David consider the Lord worthy of praise or blessing? Ps. 103:1.

2. What duty did he enjoin with the blessing? Verse 2.

3. What did he name among these benefits? Verses 3-6.

4. In forgiving the iniquities of those who receive him, what does God impute and impart to them? Rom. 4:6, 7; 3:22.

5. What is a necessary accompaniment of righteousness? Rom. 5:18; 8:10, last clause.

6. Is healing of disease always accomplished here for those who possess that life? See 2 Tim. 4:20; Heb. 11:35-38.

7. But, if we go on from faith to faith, of what is that life or spirit within us a pledge? Rom. 5:17; 8:11.

8. When, then, will all diseases be healed? Rom. 8:11; Isa. 25:8, 9; 33:24.

   **Note**—That Ps. 103:3 is sometimes true in particular cases in this life is abundantly verified; but, with very few exceptions, all of the race have eventually yielded to disease and death. While forgiveness and healing are both classed together, God has declared over and over again that he would forgive all of our sins while we are mortal. This we know to be his will. We may plead it with all confidence. But God has never declared that he would heal all diseases here. In the life hereafter, however, all diseases will be healed; we will be made immortal, incorruptible, like our blessed Lord (Phil. 3:21); of this God has given us a pledge in granting us forgiveness of sin, and bestowing upon us the gift of righteousness, which is also the gift of life—eternal life—if the righteousness is retained.

9. What blessings strew the path of all continually? Ps. 103:4; 34:22.

10. When will God execute judgment for the oppressed? Ps. 103:6; 50:3, 4. Sometimes in this life, but none will be passed over in the judgment to come.

11. To whom did God reveal his ways for all the children of men? Ps. 103:7.

12. Among these ways what precious trait of character has he revealed? Ex. 34:6, 7; Ps. 103:8.

13. How will he ever regard the truly penitent, even though his sins have been grievous? Ps. 103:9; Micah 7:18.

14. What do our sins merit us? Rom. 6:23.

15. What proof is given that God has been gracious to us, has dealt with us better than we deserve? Ps. 103:10-12.

16. How does he regard our weaknesses? Verses 13, 14; Isa. 63:9; Heb. 4:15.

17. How is God's mercy compared with man's frailty? Ps. 103:15-18.

18. Who beside the obedient may be the recipients of God's mercies? Isa. 55:7.

19. What reason have we besides God's wondrous mercy for trusting in him? Ps. 103:19; Isa. 46:10; Jude 24.

20. Because of all these wondrous manifestations of God's character, how extensive should be the praise offered him? Ps. 103:20-22.
