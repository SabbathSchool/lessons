## NOTES

1. THE ANSWER OF FAITH — We are told by Luke that on this occasion the "power of the Lord was present to heal." In Matt. 13:58 it is stated that Christ "did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief." See also Mark 6:5, 6. Now if unbelief hindered Christ from doing mighty works, there must have been the opposite of unbelief, or faith, present when his mighty power was manifested. "According to thy faith," and, "All things are possible to him that believeth," are sayings of Christ. Faith in our Lord will always bring his power according to our needs.

2. CREATOR AND REDEEMER — God alone can forgive sins. God alone by his creative power can restore broken-down tissues. When Jesus proclaimed as he did forgiveness to the paralytic, he proclaimed his divinity, and when he, by his mighty power, healed the man as a proof of his authority to forgive sin, he demonstrated that he belonged to the Godhead. This ought to have been sufficient evidence; but they were blinded by their unbelief. They could not, with many others, see the wisdom and power of God as manifested in Jesus of Nazareth. But to the believer nothing is more precious than the thought that their Saviour is man as well as God.

3. WITH SINNERS — Nothing could more clearly show the selfishness and hardness of heart of the Pharisees in the time of Christ than the charges which they brought against him. "Why, your Master has gone to eat, to mingle, with the publicans and sinners." There could be no greater honor than these very words, designed as a reproof and disgrace. In the fact that Jesus came to call sinners lies the hope of the world and every soul therein. Selfish hearts, incrusted and dried up, could not contain such doctrines, such expansive, blessed truths. They were like the dried skin bottles; the new wine would prove their destruction, unless the heart was changed through humble contrition and faith. The blind were leading the blind and realized it not. It is only the truth as it is in Jesus which can keep us from the same sad condition.
