## NOTES

1. THEY STUMBLED — The margin of the Revised Version reads in Mark 6:3 that the Jews of Nazareth "were caused to stumble." Their hearts were at first open to receive his wonderful words; but Satan suggested doubts. He called to their mind Jesus' residence with them, how he had wrought at his trade, had moved in and out among them as one of the people, and they could not bear to think that one of their number was greater than were they. Who can stand before envy (Prov. 27:4) if it is in the power of the one who envies to destroy? It was the same spirit which sold Joseph into Egypt that at Nazareth rejected Christ. At Capernaum they accepted him, at Nazareth he was forced to flee for his life. To one he was precious (1 Peter 2:7; Matt. 11:6); to the other, a stone of stumbling (1 Peter 2:8). But the cause of offense was in their own heart. The temptation of Satan was but the occasion.

2. JOHN THE BAPTIST'S DEATH — Herod Antipas (tetrarch of Galilee from B.C. 4 to A.D. 39) was the slayer of John the Baptist. He was son of Herod the Great by his fourth wife, Malthace. Like his father, he was ambitious and ostentatious. His first wife was the daughter of King Aretas; but her he divorced in order to marry Herodias, the wife of Herod Philip, his brother, an ambitious and profligate woman who was not content with the private life of her husband. The adulterous union between Antipas and Herodias was rebuked by John the Baptist. Herod's superstitious nature seems to have been somewhat in fear under the faithful preaching of John, but the rage of Herodias was aroused, and her cruel, cunning playing on the sensuous and pleasure-loving nature of the king, accomplished the death of John the Baptist and finally the ruin of her husband. In the case of these two, Herodias and John, we can find comfort in Eccl. 8:11, 12.

3. RASH OATHS — Boothroyd's translation of Lev. 5:4, 5 may help the reader to a clearer understanding of the text: "Or if a person have sworn rashly, from pronouncing with his lips, to do evil, or to do good (whatsoever it be that a man may rashly pronounce with an oath), and it be hid from him; yet when he knoweth that he is guilty in any way of these things, and that by any of these things he hath become guilty, he shall confess the sin which he hath committed; and shall bring his guilt-offering," etc. Herod was verily guilty and was exempt from his rash oath. Of course this is not understood to refer to solemn vows before God. There are other scriptures which give instruction with reference to vowing. But a rash oath or a bad promise which involves sin or injury to another in its fulfillment is better broken than kept.
