# THE BIBLE AND ITS STORY
BY JOSEPHINE POLLARD.

This beautiful book is one which will interest and instruct both young and old. It is so fully illustrated that even the child who cannot read the text "can read the pictures." The author does not make this book a medium to present her own theology, but in simple and charming style sketches the main incidents of the Bible narrative from Genesis to Revelation.

An introductory chapter on "How the Bible Came to Us" tells in simple language, whence came the various versions, such as the Septuagint and the Vulgate, and why these names were given to the versions. The book is neatly bound in cloth and contains 558 pages, with 283 illustrations, and will be sent postpaid on receipt of $1.00.

# SILENT TIMES
BY REV. J. R. MILLER, D. D.
Author of "Week-Day Religion," "Home-Making," Etc.

Those who are familiar with other works of the above author will be pleased to secure this new volume of his writings.

The book is intended as a help to the Christian in applying the teachings of the Bible to the actual experience of every-day life.

The title, "Silent Times," is suggestive of the need of the seasons of quiet in every life; it is also suggestive of one use which may be made of the book—the reading of portions of its chapters in the "silent times" of busy, feverish days, as helps in the direction of true Christian growth.

The book is well printed, contains 266 pages, and is neatly bound in parti-colored cloth, beautifully stamped in gold.

**PRICE, POSTPAID, $1.00.**

# THE PEOPLE'S LIBRARY

Is the general title of a uniform series of elevating, instructive volumes adapted to minds from twelve to twenty years of age (and even older). This Library covers a wide range of topics and territory, being didactic, descriptive, biographical and historical. While the books inculcate the purest morals, and are not antichristian, they are absolutely non-sectarian.

A brief description of the first six volumes will give an idea of what the books contain.

**FIJI AND SAMOA.**
Jottings from the Pacific No. 1, is a graphic and interesting description of the Fijian and Samoan Islands, their geographical position, their government and religion, their social and physical peculiarities, the wonderful productions of these islands, the coral formations of the Pacific, cannibalism, the curious traditions of the Islands, the past and present funeral rites, cyclones in the coral seas, and many other things of interest.

**JACK-THE CONQUEROR; or, Overcoming Difficulties,**
And other stories. These are not light, trashy, improbable tales, but they present some of the real difficulties which nearly all boys and girls are compelled to encounter, and point out the best way to meet them, so as to make the difficulties aids to higher attainments instead of hindrances. The book will not only interest but benefit the young.

**SAVONAROLA.**
The life of this great preacher of Florence. The scene of the book is, of course, that land of romance and song and heroism, Italia, where the Apostle Paul, and other witnesses of the truth, finished the "good fight of faith." The little volume is a graphic sketch of the most prominent events of the preacher's life and experience, the monasticism of the fifteenth century, the iniquities that prevailed, the political influence of Savonarola, his trial and death.

**THE TONGA ISLANDS AND OTHER GROUPS.**
Jottings from the Pacific No. 2. This volume is for the Tonga Islands what "Jottings from the Pacific No. 1" is for the Fijian and Samoan Groups. But there is no sameness between the two. The islands, people, customs and products are sufficiently varied to make another volume equal to or exceeding in interest the first.

**LETTERS FROM THE HOLY LAND**
Illustrates many customs and practices, peoples and things, so different from those of our own land. The reading of the book will make much more intelligent and interesting the study and reading of the Word of God. It contains a large number of illustrated chapter headings and full-page cuts.

**AMONG THE NORTHERN ICEBERGS.**
This book gives most interesting sketches of the Arctic expeditions of England and our own land in the nineteenth century. The rising generation will appreciate the reading of this account second only to those who read the graphic narrations at the times of their occurrence. It is an interesting and instructive book.

Each volume is fully illustrated and contains 160 pages. The set, therefore, has nearly 1,000 pages, and will certainly be a valuable addition to any library, and especially to that of a young person.

The set of 6 books, neatly bound in fancy cloth, embossed in jet and gold, and enclosed in a box, SENT POSTPAID, for $3.60.
