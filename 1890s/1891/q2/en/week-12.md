## NOTES

1. THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL — The answer of Jesus contained a deeper meaning, which would afterward appear to the disciples, than lies on the surface. This woman of despised Canaan, no better than a dog to the strict Jews, belonged to those "other sheep" of which our Saviour spoke (John 10:16), who were lost to the fold of Israel. It was a part of Christ's mission to gather them into the fold of the true Israel of God. This woman was, as is everyone who longs after God, one of the lost sheep of the house of Israel, whom the Son of God came to save. See Eph. 2:11, 12, 19, 20.

2. THE GREAT MISSIONARY — The journey to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon was between forty and fifty miles. Our Lord went there and returned immediately, having done nothing but to heal the woman's daughter. He even seemed to slight her feelings, but he was drawing out her faith, and developing within her soul strength and perseverance of character. It is a wonderful lesson of faith exemplified in the conduct of the woman, and it is also a wonderful evidence of Christ's knowledge, love, and power to help any soul, in any place or condition, which desires his help and presence. As he was to the woman of Canaan, so will he be to everyone who realizes his own need and exercises faith in God.

3. ACCORDING TO OUR NEED — We may learn among other lessons that Christ's knowledge recognizes our necessities, that his power is sufficient to supply our need, even to create if necessary, and that his love will do it. We should learn that the fact that he has blessed us and come to our need in the past is an evidence that he will in the present. When the four thousand are in need, let us not forget the miracle of the five thousand.
