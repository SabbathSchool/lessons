### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 2 - The scourging and crowning with thorns took place before Jesus was delivered to be crucified. See John 19:1-3. Pilate presents Jesus before the Jews while undergoing these sufferings, and endeavors to move their pity. After delivering him to the Jews, the other indignities and insults mentioned by Matthew and Mark were heaped upon him; but he bore all without a murmur, praying for his persecutors, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."

2. QUESTION 4 - Called the place of a skull, because the configuration of the mountain is such that from a certain position and at a certain distance it resembles a huge human skull. On their way to the place of crucifixion occurred the incident recorded in Luke 23:27-31.

3. QUESTION 5 - They offered to Christ wine and myrrh. It was customary among the ancient nations to give to criminals just before death a drink which would render them stupid, and so lessen their sufferings. This may be what is referred to in Prov. 31:6, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish." But Jesus refused it. He would drink the full cup of his sufferings to the very dregs.

4. QUESTION 21 - The legs of Jesus were not broken, that in him the paschal lamb might meet its antitype. Ex. 12:46. The piercing of the side John records, doubtless, to show that Jesus really died. John gives the fact as a basis of belief. See 1 John 5:8.

5. QUESTION 22 - It was not the physical pain and torture which caused the death of Jesus. It was customary for those crucified to linger for days in agony before death came to their relief. It was for this reason that, when the centurion learned of the death of Jesus, he "marveled." Mark 15:44. Some have claimed that the blood and water which followed the spear thrust showed his death to be from heart disease. John 19:31-36. But however this may be, it is certain that Jesus gave his life for the world; he broke his heart in sorrow for their sin. "He hath poured out his soul unto death," says the prophet (Isa. 53:12); "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death," says Jesus in Gethsemane (Matt. 26:38). And Jesus says again of his life: "No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself." See John 10:17, 18. It was a voluntary offering for the sins of men.
