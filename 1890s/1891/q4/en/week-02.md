### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 1 - The reason why Jesus would have no one know of his passing through, evidently, only that part of Galilee lying north of Capernaum, was that he might not be delayed on his way to more important fields, and that he might have opportunity of instructing his disciples when alone with them.

2. QUESTION 9 - There is no more precious grace in the eyes of the Lord than true humility; and there is a reason for this, for he who has a low opinion of his own wisdom, his own righteousness, his own strength, will seek the wisdom and righteousness and strength of God. Hence the high and lofty One dwells with the humble and contrite ones, to revive and encourage them. Isa. 57:15; 66:2. The truest wisdom is that which is of the greatest use; and as in the way of righteousness alone is eternal life found, so that wisdom which leads to righteousness is the greatest wisdom. So while man may not glory in the wisdom, and might, and riches of the world, he may glory in that which is infinitely greaterâ€”the knowledge of God, who exercises "loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth; for in these things I delight, saith the Lord," and the knowledge of God is revealed in the meek and lowly. Ps. 25:9, 14; 139:6. The smallest in their own sight are greatest in the eyes of the Lord; for these only can he make great. The greatest faith is that which believes all which God says without question; and true faith is inseparably connected with that love which keeps all the commandments of God. Gal. 5:6. True greatness in God's eyes is, therefore, wise, faithful, loving service, a losing of one's self in the will of God.

3. QUESTION 20 - "Offend," in verses 42, 43, 45, and 47, should be translated as in the Revised Version, "cause to stumble," "Whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble," etc., and, "If thy hand cause thee to stumble," etc. It is not to be understood that the hand, or the foot, or the eye, should be literally cut off or plucked out; for these members but follow the desire of the heart and command or assent of the will. But we should sever from us everything which would cause us to stumble, even though it be as dear as a hand or foot or eye. This is true as a church, it is true as individuals. "The fire that never shall be quenched" ought to be, as in the Revised Version, simply "unquenchable fire," that is, fire which cannot be quenched till it consumes what it has preyed upon, the worm which does not die till it has devoured the carcasses and there is no more left. An example of this unquenchable fire is given in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. See Jer. 17:27; compare with 2 Chron. 36:19, 21; or Jude 7 with 2 Peter 2:6. In both cases the fire burned up, and then went out. The word "hell" comes from Gehenna, the Valley of Hinnom, a place outside of Jerusalem where the dead carcasses of malefactors and all manner of filth and rubbish were cast. Here worms preyed upon it, and what was left was consumed by the fires which were kept constantly burning. The word is therefore used as symbolical of the punishment of the wicked, denoting utter and final destruction.

4. QUESTION 21 - The necessity of the inward work of grace on the heart is shown by verses 49, 50. Salt is known for its power to preserve. In this sense it is a symbol of righteousness. It matters not what the deed is, the inward motive, the state of the soul, the inner life, is what determines its worth. If righteousness is not in the heart of the believer, he is like salt without saltness.
