### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 4 - The solemn, tender assurance, warning, and instruction given to Peter by the Lord, as recorded in Luke 22:31-34, seems to be one phase of the same conversation as recorded in John 13:36-38, and occurred before the Lord's Supper. This conversation recorded in Matthew and Mark took place on the way to Gethsemane.

2. QUESTION 12 - There were two petitions in the prayer of Christ: (1) "Take away this cup from me" (2) "Nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt." The first was in his mind of secondary importance; the second petition was primary. He longed for the first; he shrank from the ordeal with an agony that forced from his pores great drops of blood; but he longed for the second more. The first petition was not answered; the second and important petition was; and hence his prayer was answered. Such should be the prayer of every follower of Jesus. Whatever difficulty, trial, affliction, or cross lies before us, while we pray for its removal, let us pray above all that God's will may be done. Our prayers will then never go unanswered, and we may know that God's will is best. Believing this, we may say with all our heart, "O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done." Matt. 26:42. Only in so doing is there peace.
         "God pity those who cannot say,
         'Not mine, but thine,' who only pray,
         'Let this cup pass,' who do not see
          The purpose in Gethsemane."

3. QUESTION 13 - As Jesus comes to his disciples, whom he had entreated to watch with him, he finds them sleeping. While gently reproving Peter, he yet frames an excuse for their sleeping. The spirit was ready, but the flesh weak. But the third time when he comes, the struggle is over, the victory won. He longs for their companionship in watching no longer; they may sleep on and take their rest. It is enough; the hour of agony was over. But even as he speaks, the footsteps of the mob are heard, and Jesus says, "Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand."

4. QUESTION 22 - "And they all forsook him, and fled." This is just what Jesus had warned them of, that all would be offended because of him. All had denied it, but the words of the Master were true. How little do men know of what is in their own heart. Jesus was left alone, and yet he was not alone, for the Father was with him. John 16:32.
