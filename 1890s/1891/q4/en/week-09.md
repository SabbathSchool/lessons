### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 10 - It would seem from Luke that at the passover supper a strife took place among the disciples as to which should be the greatest. This may have been manifested by their positions at the table. After the opening words and ceremony (Luke 22:14-18), Jesus arose from the Passover supper and washed his disciples feet, instituting an ordinance of humility, as recorded in John 13.

2. QUESTION 16 - The very passover supper at which our Lord and his disciples were sitting, was the last legitimate one which would ever be celebrated. Its origin is recorded in Exodus 12, at the time when the angel of wrath smote the firstborn of Egypt and passed over the houses of those who had sprinkled the blood of the passover lamb on the doorcasing. Jesus is our passover, and if our sins are covered by his blood in the day of God's fierce anger, no evil will befall us, no plague will come near our dwelling. The passover lamb, without spot or blemish, of which a bone was not broken, typified the Lamb of God, whose blood was shed for all.

3. QUESTION 17 - It is quite difficult to place in chronological order the events of the passover night. "It seems evident that what is recorded in Luke 22:31-38, and John 13:31 to the close of chapter 14, took place just after Judas went out. That warning to Peter would be a distinct and prior warning to that recorded in Mark. The "Arise, and let us go hence;" of John 14:31, would be uttered just after the Lord's Supper, just before leaving for Gethsemane.

4. QUESTION 20 - In John 6:53, 54 we are told that, except we eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God, we have no life in us, and that if we do this we have eternal life. Jesus says in the same chapter, verse 63, that the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that he speaks are spirit and life. Christ's sufferings in the flesh were in our behalf (Col. 1:21, 22; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 5:7; 1 Peter 2:24); his blood was shed for the guilty (1 Peter 1:18, 19), and he has promised that all who have personal faith in this offering shall have eternal life (John 3:16). It is through faith in the promise and power of Christ that we become "partakers of the divine nature," that we have eternal life. 2 Peter 1:4. God is no respecter of persons; he will give life freely to all who will believe.

5. QUESTION 23 - The two greatest events in the history of the race are brought to mind in the Lord's Supper. We are carried back to his humiliation, his labors, his suffering, his agony, his death; and we are carried forward "till he come," when he will come forth and serve his people at the marriage supper of the Lamb.
