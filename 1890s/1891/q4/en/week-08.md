### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 3 - The disciples asked these questions, the answers to which can be fully comprehended only by comparing and combining the three accounts of this remarkable prophetic discourse. The first question related to the destruction of the temple, the second to the second coming of Christ, and the third to the end of the world, or age, when probation closed. Matthew, and Mark also, proceeds to answer the last question first. Matt. 24:1-14; Mark 13:1-13. Then he takes up the destruction of Jerusalem (Mark 13:14-18), and from that destruction of the Jews he proceeds to the greater affliction of the people of God during the Dark Ages, and thence to Christ's second coming.

2. QUESTION 11 - "Those days," of verses 19 and 20, refer to the time of the greatest persecution the people of God ever suffered or ever will suffer. This persecution began during the reign of Pagan Rome, but culminated in the great Papal tribulation of 1260 years, between 538 and 1798 A.D.

3. QUESTION 14 - Matthew says the darkening of the sun was to take place "immediately after the tribulation of those days." Mark says, "In those days, after that tribulation." The ending of the tribulation of the days is well marked: (1) By the decree of toleration promulgated by Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, in 1776; and (2) by opening to the oppressed of the world free and independent America. The first sign—the darkening of the sun—must, therefore, occur between 1776 and 1798; and it did occur four years after the tribulation ceased, May 19, 1780. The obscuration of the sun came at the very time indicated by the prophecy, and was regarded by scientific men as beyond their power to explain, and by religious men as a sure precursor of Christ's second coming. The darkening of the moon occurred the next night. The falling of the stars took place in 1833, November 13.
