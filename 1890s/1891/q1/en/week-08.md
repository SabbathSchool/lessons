## NOTES

1. James 3:10.—"These things ought not so to be." The force of the word translated "ought," is stronger than is expressed by the English word. It means that it must not be so. It is so inconsistent that it is utterly intolerable; it is monstrous.

2. Verse 11.—"Sweet water and bitter." The sweet water corresponds to the "blessing," and the bitter water to the "cursing" spoken of in the verse before. And as a fountain does not send out both sweet and bitter water from the same place at the same time, so from the fountain of the heart should not come forth both blessing and cursing. But, as in a fountain, if bitter water should perchance be mingled with the sweet, the whole would be spoiled, so all the blessings which the heart utters toward God are utterly vitiated and spoiled by the cursings which the same heart utters toward men. Hence it brings forth no good fruit at all.

3. Verse 12.—James' statement concerning the fig-tree and the vine is much stronger than that in reference to the fountain, for two veins of water, a good and a poor, might possibly meet and pour forth their mingled streams from the same orifice; but in nature it is impossible for the fig-tree to bear olives; or a vine, figs. Such a monstrosity in nature is unknown. It remains for human nature alone to make so depraved an exhibition. But the fruit determines the nature of the tree. If olive berries are produced, however much the tree may bear an outward semblance to the fig, it is not a fig-tree, but an olive-tree. So if the traits of a man's character are evil, if that is the fruit he bears, however much he may profess to be a Christian, he is not such, but a sinner. A soul that is depraved must act within the bounds of that depravity. Hypocrisy, the counterfeit, can be manifested only on the side of the good. A soul really good cannot manifest sham traits of evil, for it would thereby become evil; but a soul really evil can manifest sham traits of goodness, and not thereby become good.

4. Verse 13.—Heavenly wisdom has an inseparable attendant, which is love; and love produces fruits by which its presence is ever manifested, and by which a person's condition can be tested. If anyone claims to be endowed with true wisdom, let us note what effect it has on his temper and conduct. Is his whole course of conduct characterized by meekness? Does he seek to avoid sin, and follow the things which make for peace? Is he in behavior modest and moderate, patient and harmless? Is he ready to yield to claims which are just and proper? Is he kind and compassionate, and ready to forgive? Is he careful and diligent in the performance of his duties toward God and toward men? Is he sincere and upright in all his decisions? Such traits are characteristic of true wisdom, that which is from above, as specified in verse 17.

5. Verse 18.—Righteousness as manifested in the manner set forth in the verses embraced in this lesson, is sure to produce its good results, as seed that is sown is to produce a harvest. It is men of peace who sow the seeds of truth. Men of turmoil and strife cannot recommend any course, nor properly advocate any truth. But the peace-makers are continually recommending the wisdom by which they are governed, to others; and their course of conduct is represented as the sowing of heavenly seed, which is sure to bring forth divine fruit. "To enjoy the peace of God in the conscience, and to live to promote peace among men, is to answer the end of our creation, and to enjoy as much happiness ourselves as the present state of things can afford."—Clarke.
