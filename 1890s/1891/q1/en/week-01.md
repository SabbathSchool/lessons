# LESSON 1
**JANUARY 3, 1891**

## JAMES

**NOTE.**—There are several persons brought to view in the New Testament who bear the name of James, as, "James the son of Zebedee" (Mark 1:19), "James the son of Alphaeus" (Mark 3:18), and "James the brother of the Lord" (Matt. 13:55). Which one of these wrote the book called the epistle of James, is a question on which there is great diversity of opinion; but it is the general view (see Smith's Bible Dictionary, art. "James, Epistle of") that the writer of this book was not the apostle James, the son of Zebedee, but James the Lord's brother, who, though not one of the twelve, was an elder of the church at Jerusalem, and one of the "pillars" (Gal. 2:9) of the new Christian faith. Acts 12:17; 15:13; 21:18; 1 Cor. 15:7; Gal. 1:19 (from which we may infer that he was also an apostle); Gal. 2:9, 12. It was written from Jerusalem, where James seems always to have resided, and sometime after the apostolic council at Jerusalem, A.D. 51 (Acts 15:6), the latest date assigned it being A.D. 62, the epistle itself (according to marginal note inserted by translators) bearing date "Anno Domini cir [about] 60."

## NOTES

1. The epistle of James is addressed to Christians, and while its lessons of patience, obedience, stability, faith, and devotion to the cause of God, are applicable to members of the Christian church in every age, there are some expressions which show that it was designed to be particularly applicable to the church in the last days, and hence may be taken to apply specifically at that time.

2. If the epistle has a particular application to the last days, and Christians here addressed are designated as "the twelve tribes scattered abroad," it shows that no Israel is now recognized but Christian or spiritual Israel, all tribal distinctions between the natural descendants of Abraham having been lost. It would be necessary for this distinction to be preserved, if the natural seed is still to be regarded as Israel; but it is evident that no such distinction with reference to the spiritual seed is possible among men, though it may be preserved in those books above in which are enrolled the names of the members of the church of the First-born. See Heb. 12:23. This fact with reference to the Bible view of Israel, so plainly brought out in James, explains how the work of Rev. 7:1-8, gathering out twelve thousand from each tribe of the children of Israel, can be fulfilled in the last generation that lives before the second coming of Christ.

3. The word "patience" here has the significance of endurance, or the quality of not being moved or overthrown on account of the burdens, difficulties, or afflictions attending the profession of a Christian. The verb from which this noun is derived, signifies, "to remain or stay behind when others have departed; to bear up under, endure, suffer patiently; to continue firm, hold out, remain constant, persevere." In the expression, "Let patience have her perfect work," the word "perfect" means "brought to completion; fully accomplished; fully developed;" but endurance cannot be "brought to completion" until the period of our trial and conflict is over. The passage is therefore equivalent to the exhortation to "endure unto the end" (Matt. 24:13), or to "be patient [endure] unto the coming of the Lord" Jas. 5:7.
