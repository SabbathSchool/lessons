### NOTES

1. Who Is He That Will Harm You, etc. In a general way this means that men will have no desire to harm those who are imitators of Christ, and under ordinary circumstances this has been true as promised (see Prov. 16:7), but there are many exceptions to this general rule. But even though we suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, that will not work to our ultimate harm, though it causes present sufferings; for to them that love God all things work together for good; even in the greatest sufferings his followers are, through the love of God, more than conquerors. See Rom. 8:28, 37. In the very sufferings then they may find happiness and rejoice. See also Matt. 5:11, 12.

2. The Revised Version makes the latter part of verse 14 and the first part of verse 15 almost identical with the latter part of Isa. 8:12 and the first part of verse 13. Isaiah reads: "Neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself." Peter reads: "Fear not their fear, neither be troubled; but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord." Isaiah tells us in the next clause what the Lord will be to those who trust in him. "He shall be for a sanctuary," a safe and holy place; for in the time of trouble God will spread over us the pavilion of his power (Ps. 27:5; 34:7), and hide us under the shadow of his wings (Ps. 17:8), in the secret place of his tabernacle (Ps. 27:5).
