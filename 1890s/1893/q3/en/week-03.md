### NOTES

1. Conversation.—This word, found in verse 15 of the last lesson and verse 18 of this (see also 2:12; 3:1, 2), means the whole course of conduct, manner of life, behavior. See the Revised Version. This is what conversation meant in English when the Bible was translated, and is so used now in some instances, but in most cases is applied to common talking among persons. Let the student understand that, while it is not confined to speech, it includes that as a part of the "manner of life." From the vain worldly manner of life God has redeemed us to a new manner of life, even his own.
