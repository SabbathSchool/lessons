### NOTES

1. Lively Stones.—Better, "living stones." The child of God is ever represented by something which has life, and implies action. He is the soldier on duty (Eph. 6:13), the contender in the games (1 Cor. 9:24), the pilgrim traveler (Heb. 11:13), a living branch of the True Vine (John 15:5); he is to grow (Eph. 4:15), to walk (Eph. 4:1), to run (Heb. 12:1), to fight the fight of faith (1 Tim. 6:12), to watch, to work, etc., etc.; and when an inanimate object is taken to represent the Christian, like a stone, that object is given life. This life comes from Christ, the living Rock, on which believers as stones are builded, receiving life from the foundation, Christ (1 Cor. 3:11; Gal. 2:20). They thus become welded or grown to the rock connected with the one life. The object of this building is said to be to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God. All that makes anything acceptable to God is that Christ shall be in it, and if Christ is in us, and we in him, the praises and prayers of his people, the sacrifices for his sake, their labors of love, in fact, the very life, are all acceptable in the Beloved. (See Hos. 14:1; Mal. 1:11; Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15, 16.)
