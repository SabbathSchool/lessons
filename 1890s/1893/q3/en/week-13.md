### NOTES

1. Whom Resist.—The only way to resist the enemy is by faith in Christ. We cannot do it by watching Satan as we would by watching a physical foe. If our eyes are fixed upon the enemy, we fall before him; and it is his greatest object to induce us to look at him. When Peter looked down upon the raging waves, he sank; when his eyes were on Christ, he safely walked the boiling billows. "Looking unto Jesus" is our only safety (Heb. 12:2, 3); for faith puts him before us so that we do not have to meet the enemy; Christ meets him. Satan's accusations fall against Christ's righteousness, his craft against Christ's wisdom, his power against the mighty power of Christ, and by faith we are more than conquerors. We are not alone in trials; the children of God have them to meet everywhere, but Christ is able to succor all who trust him. Heb. 2:18.
