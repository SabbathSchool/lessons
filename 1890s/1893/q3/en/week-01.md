### NOTES

1. The expression in the first verse, "strangers scattered," is in the Revised Version "sojourners of the dispersion," and because of this expression thought by many to refer to Israel according to the flesh; but while believing Jews are doubtless included, it is very evident that the epistle is addressed and comes with peculiar force to Gentile believers. See chapter 2:10. As we proceed in the study of the epistle, it will be seen that while it has been a blessing to the church through all the past, it has special application and force in the last days. See chapter 1:13; 4:7, 12, 13, 17.

2. The elect of God primarily is Christ himself (Isa. 42:1), and all those who are Christ's are therefore also the elect of God. They are chosen before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4), according to the foreknowledge of God (1 Peter 1:2), chosen to be holy and without blame (Eph. 1:4), chosen to salvation (2 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 2:10), chosen through the belief of the truth, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus (2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2).

3. Faith is based upon God's word. God says it; faith says it is so, and so it is. Hope is based on God's promise. The one all-embracing promise of God is that relating to the seed, Jesus Christ. (See Gen. 3:15; 13:16; 22:17, 18, and other passages.) This hope centers in Christ, his death and resurrection. To this Paul refers as "the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers" (Acts 26:6). This hope included the resurrection of the dead (verse 8; 24:15); it was the "hope of Israel" (28:20); it is the hope of the Lord's coming (Titus 2:13), of eternal life (3:7), of salvation (1 Thess. 5:8), of the incorruptible inheritance (1 Peter 1:4); it is the hope of the gospel (Col. 1:23), Christ our hope (1 Tim. 1:1), Christ in you the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). We are begotten again unto that hope by the word of the gospel (1 Peter 1:23; James 1:18), but that word of the gospel is the Living Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, who demonstrated his power over sin and death by his resurrection (Acts 2:24). This hope in Christ is therefore a "living hope," ever growing brighter, bigger, stronger, as we appropriate the living word.

4. Trial of Your Faith.—Every day brings its trials of faith, every temptation puts faith to the test; but to him who has genuine faith there is never any more danger of faith's failing under the one test than another. It matters not how great the test; power awaits on faith sufficient for every need. It is not a matter of the strength of the person tempted, or the strength of the temptation brought; it is a matter of simple faith in Christ. Faith puts Christ in our place, and Christ is equally able to meet all the armies of Satan as one of his lowest minions. He who thus endures temptation proves in every trial that his faith is genuine, a precious experience indeed here, but more precious when found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
