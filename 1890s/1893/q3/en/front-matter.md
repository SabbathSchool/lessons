# SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS

## ON THE

# First Epistle of Peter

FOR SENIOR CLASSES

July 1 to September 30, 1893

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The plan of these lessons will not be greatly different from that of the first quarter of 1893. The lesson scripture is sometimes divided and the principal topic of the division named where it has seemed advisable. The main questions are suggestive of the study of the book proper. The principal and most profitable doctrines and truths suggested in the lesson are developed more fully in the notes, which will furnish every live teacher with basis sufficient for as long a lesson as is desired. It is earnestly hoped that what has thus far been learned of the word of God and the power of the Spirit in that word will be brought into these lessons. There may be much worthy of criticism in the style of the lessons, but let the mind of the student be attent to the word of God, with an earnest desire to hear, believe, and do, and he will be richly rewarded in spiritual growth.
