## THE CHOSEN PEOPLE. 1 Peter 2:9-16

REVIEW QUESTIONS.—(a) By what are Christians begotten? (b) Upon what are they to feed in order to grow? (c) Upon whom are they built? (d) Thus builded what are they?

### I. The Call. Verses 9, 10

1. What are those called who are builded upon Christ?
2. For what purpose are they called, chosen, crowned, separated, purchased?
3. What was their former condition?

### II. An Earnest Exhortation. Verses 11, 12

1. With what earnest words does the Lord exhort his people?
2. What should be their conversation (conduct) among the Gentiles?
3. What would be the result of such a life?

### III. Civil Duties. Verses 13-16

1. What is the Christian's duty as regards the laws of men? Note.
2. From what motive, and for whose sake, should it be done?
3. Does this include obedience to laws which conflict with God's law?
4. When we obey our rulers in the exercise of rightful authority, what will be the result?
5. Should this obedience be rendered as servants of men?

### NOTE

When rulers enact foolish or oppressive laws, especially in a republic, they are frequently spoken of with disrespect and contempt by the people. Such examples often become contagious; but Christians should not thus allow themselves to be carried away by bad examples; and all laws, needless and oppressive though they may be, should be obeyed with faithfulness unless they contravene God's laws. In such case only may we refuse to obey.
