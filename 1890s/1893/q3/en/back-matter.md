## Some Important Works

**PROPHETIC LIGHTS**. By E. J. Waggoner. As its title indicates, it treats of some of the leading prophecies both of the Old and New Testaments, showing the exact fulfillment of the predictions of the Bible concerning Egypt, Tyre, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome; also of the prophecies concerning the first advent of Christ, which proves the inspiration of the Bible, and gives assurance that other prophecies which are noted will as surely and exactly be fulfilled. Nearly all the illustrations of this book were designed and engraved especially for this work at great expense and are a study in themselves. Heavy paper covers, 50¢; Cloth, gilt edges, $1.00.

**STEPS TO CHRIST**. By Mrs. E. G. White. The rare ability of the author in the presentation of the Scripture truth has never been used to greater advantage than in this little work. "Steps to Christ" is not alone suitable as a guide to the inquirer and young convert, but is rich in thought and suggestion for the most mature Christian. Cloth, 75¢.

**"MATTHEW 24," or THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST**. Edited by Alonzo T. Jones. An exposition of the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew. Bible Students' Library, No. 58. 96 pages, 10¢.

**THE JUDGMENT**. By the late J. N. Andrews. The events of the judgment and their order. Bible Students' Library, No. 55. 136 pages, paper covers, 15¢.

**THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS**. By H. A. St. John. A pamphlet in two parts, giving a brief resume of the advents of Christ and the prophecies which cluster around those great events. Two diagrams illustrate and assist the reader in the study of the prophecy and its fulfillment. Just out. Bible Students' Library, No. 97. Price, 10¢.
