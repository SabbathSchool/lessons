### NOTES

1. A Partaker of the Glory That Shall Be Revealed.—God's glory is in his character (see Ex. 33:18; 34:5-7). That character, that glory, will be seen in all its transcendent loveliness when the King appears in his beauty (Isa. 33:17); but men may know him here (John 17:3), by faith they may now appropriate his righteousness (Rom. 3:21, 22), and have the beauty of the Lord upon them (Ps. 90:17). And so Peter in this life partook of the glory which shall be revealed, not only in Christ but in us (Rom. 8:18).

2. Neither As Being Lords over God's Heritage.—There is a strange and striking contrast between that church which claims to find her primal head in Peter, and in which is the highest development of the mystery of iniquity, and the instruction given by the Lord through Peter to the true church of Christ. In the apostate church we have lords many, who do little else but lord it over the souls of God's heritage, and when they held the power, they lorded over their bodies; and all of the persecutions of the Dark Ages have come because men professing to be ministers of Christ have lorded it over God's heritage in their lust of power and filthy lucre. The apostle presents the duty of the true elder; let him heed the instructions, and not content himself with being better than others. Feed the flock of God with the Word (1 Peter 2:2), which is able to build them up (Acts 20:32); doing willingly even as the Master, having compassion (Mark 6:34), not for gain of lucre but gain of souls, ensamples to the flock in all soberness, humility, and faithfulness. (See 1 Tim. 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9.)
