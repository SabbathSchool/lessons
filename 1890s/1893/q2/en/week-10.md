### NOTES

1. The term "gospel" signifies good news. The gospel of the kingdom would mean the good news of the kingdom. The kingdom is associated with the second advent of Jesus Christ. Compare 2 Tim. 4:1; Luke 21:31; with Matt. 24:33. Therefore to preach the gospel of the kingdom, in the sense of Matt. 24:14, would mean to preach the second coming of the Saviour.

2. The Bible has been translated into more than two hundred languages and dialects, and there are but few nations who have not heard the sound of this gospel. In a few of these nations the sound of the good news of the coming kingdom has gone but faintly, but the people are calling for someone to come and instruct them. The Lord has prepared the nations to receive the everlasting gospel, and is now calling for his people to go forth and sound it with a loud cry.
