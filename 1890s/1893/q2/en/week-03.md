### NOTES

1. In John 6:63 we learn that the words of Christ are spirit and life. Then, when his word abides in us (1 John 3:24), and our lives answer to that word as the reflection in the mirror does to the face, we are assured that we have the witness, or testimony, for the word is the Spirit's testimony that we are children of God.

2. The original word is much stronger than our English word: "Receiving a portion, especially of an inheritance; as substantive, an heir, one who has a lot (not one to whom a lot is allotted, because it is derived from the active; but), he who has the inheritance, the stress being laid on the possession."—Bullinger. A joint heir is one who is in partnership with another in the inheritance; man lost the dominion, or inheritance; Christ gave his life to redeem it, and man, by accepting him, becomes an heir with him.

3. Rabbi Lesser's English Translation of the Old Testament reads: "And thou, O Tower of the flocks, the Stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall go, and shall come, the former dominion, the kingdom belonging to the daughter of Jerusalem."

4. By comparing Micah 4:8 with Ps. 45:9, 10; Songs 5:8, we must conclude that the term "daughters" refers to the believers, or the flock. Christ is often spoken of as the Shepherd of the flock. See John 10:7, 16.
