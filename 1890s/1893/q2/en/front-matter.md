# Lessons on the Coming of the Lord
FOR SENIOR CLASSES.

April 1 to June 24, 1893.

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

In the study of these lessons on the coming of the Lord it is expected that the pupil will make an effort to commit the leading texts so as to repeat them without the Bible. It will be well to study the historical extracts until the substance of them can be readily given. As the day of the Lord is drawing near, those who are looking for him should be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in them. To do this means more than to point the hearer to the text in the Bible. It means that the believer is filled with that word, until it flows fresh from the mind. We should not be satisfied when we have looked up the texts that are given in the lessons, but should let these texts lead us to others on the same subject. If the student will do this, the study of the coming of the Lord will be a profitable study.
