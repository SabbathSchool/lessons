### NOTES

1. "Surfeit, first, fullness and oppression occasioned by excessive eating and drinking; second, to overfeed, and produce sickness or uneasiness." —Webster.

2. "God bestowed upon these antediluvians many rich gifts, but they used his bounties to glorify themselves, and turned them into a curse by fixing their affections upon the gifts instead of the Giver. They employed the gold and silver, the precious stones, and the choice wood, in the construction of habitations for themselves, and endeavored to excel one another in beautifying their dwellings with the most skillful workmanship. They sought only to gratify the desires of their own proud hearts, and reveled in scenes of pleasure and wickedness." —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 90, 91.

3. "In Sodom there was mirth and revelry, feasting and drunkenness. The vilest and most brutal passions were unrestrained. The people openly defied God and his law, and delighted in deeds of violence." —Ibid.

4. "At the time of Lot's removal to Sodom, corruption had not become universal, and God, in his mercy, permitted rays of light to shine amid the moral darkness. When Abraham rescued the captives from the Elamites, the attention of the people was called to the true faith." —Ibid.
