### NOTES

1. Prophecy is history written before it is made. God, who knows the end from the beginning, speaks through his prophets to the world, that they may know what is coming in the future, and be prepared to meet it. The Saviour often spoke of himself as fulfilling the words of the prophets concerning his work. Had the people given heed to the prophetic Scripture, they would not have rejected him. So in the last days they that study the word of prophecy and believe it will be in the light, while those who reject this word will be lost.

2. "That no prophecy of the Scripture, whether that referred to above, or any other, is of any private interpretation, proceeds from the prophet's own knowledge or invention, or was the offspring of calculation or conjecture. The word 'epilusis' signifies, also, impetus, impulse, and probably this is the best sense here—not by mere private impulse of his own mind." —Clarke.

3. In 1 Peter 1:11 we learn that it was the Spirit of Christ that was in the prophets that led them to speak the words they spoke. In the opening words of the book of Revelation, we are informed that it is a "revelation of Jesus Christ," which he sent through his angel to John. This angel tells John (Rev. 22:9) that he was the fellow-servant of John and the other prophets before him. Then every prophet was instructed by Christ's angel, and Jesus himself was the authority for all that was spoken.

4. "By some of the ancients a generation was fixed at a hundred years, by others at a hundred and ten years, by others at thirty-three, thirty-five, and even at twenty years. So that there was nothing uniform and settled in this matter." —Cruden. "Genea, birth, race, descent, offspring; it denotes an age, or generation from the point of view of race." —Bullinger.
