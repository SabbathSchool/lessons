### NOTES

1. The original word from which our word "redemption" comes is defined by Bullinger as "the act of freeing or releasing; deliverance; redemption for one from guilt and punishment, brought about by expiation. Deliverance from the guilt and punishment of sin, and applying to the whole being, deliverance of the soul from sin, and the body from the grave."

2. In listening to the words of Satan man lost his innocence, his life, and his dominion. In this he fell under condemnation. Before he disobeyed, he was innocent, or free from condemnation. In Rom. 5:16 we read that condemnation came upon man by sin. As soon as he transgressed, he showed his loss of innocence by hiding himself (Gen. 3:8, 10), and trembled when he heard the word of the Lord. This condemnation has passed on all (Rom. 5:18), so that the whole world stands guilty before God (Rom. 3:19). To be placed in his original position before his Creator, man must be redeemed from condemnation and death, and reinstated in his dominion.

3. The Jews expressed the whole compass of things by "aleph" and "tau," the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet. But John was writing in the Greek, and accommodates it to the Greek alphabet, of which "alpha" and "omega" are the first and the last letters. By his word Christ spoke the worlds into existence (Ps. 33:6-9); and by the same word he upholds them. Heb. 1:3. It will be by the same word that he restores all things, thus making him the beginning and ending of all things.
