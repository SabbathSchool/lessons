### NOTES

1. Peter said that the time of restoration of all things was spoken of by all the prophets since the world began. By carefully studying the prophetic scriptures, it will be noticed that the Lord very frequently reminds his people of a judgment day when the Lord would cut off the wicked and give the faithful an inheritance in the new earth.

2. The Scriptures everywhere teach that God has appointed a judgment day (Acts 17:31), when every man shall give an account of all that he has done (Eccl. 12:14; 2 Cor. 5:10). They also teach that all the dead are to be raised from their graves (John 5:28, 29), to receive their rewards, and that these great events are connected with the second coming of the Lord (2 Tim. 4:1; Rev. 22:12).
