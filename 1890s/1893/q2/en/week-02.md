### NOTES

1. We have Christ in the heart by faith, and faith comes by the word of God; therefore, we can only know that we are Christ's by this word that abides in us. John 15:7; Gal. 5:22, 23; Rom. 8:16.

2. The Saviour said unto his disciples, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." This is true of all the words he spoke, and therefore true of those words he spoke concerning his second coming. When he comes, he will give life to all the dead, and remove all corruption from those who have kept the pledge he left with them when he redeemed them from sin. When we study his words on this subject, they should indeed be life to us.

3. This text is often used by Bible students as a command. But by reading the Revised Version we perhaps get a better understanding of its meaning: "Ye search the Scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me."
