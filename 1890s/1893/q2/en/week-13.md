### NOTES

1. "That the expression 'bottomless pit' represents the earth in a state of confusion and darkness is evident from other scriptures. Concerning the condition of the earth 'in the beginning' the Bible record says that it was 'without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep' (Gen. 1:2); the word here translated 'deep' is the same that in Rev. 20:1-3 is rendered 'bottomless pit.' Prophecy teaches that it will be brought back, partially, at least, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day of God, the prophet Jeremiah declares: 'I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.'" —Great Controversy, p. 658, 659.

2. "Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years. Limited to the earth, he will not have access to other worlds, to tempt and annoy those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that he is bound; there are none remaining upon whom he can exercise his power. He is wholly cut off from the work of deception and ruin, which for so many centuries has been his sole delight." —Ibid.

3. "During the thousand years between the first and second resurrection, the judgment of the wicked takes place. The Apostle Paul points to this judgment as an event that follows the second advent. 1 Cor. 4:5. Daniel declares that when the Ancient of Days came, 'judgment was given to the saints of the Most High.' Dan. 7:22. At this time the righteous reign as kings and priests unto God." —Ibid, pp. 660, 661.

4. "The time has come to which holy men have looked with longing, since the flaming sword barred the first pair from Eden, the time for 'the redemption of the purchased possession.' Micah 4:8. The earth originally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption. All that was lost by sin has been restored. Isa. 45:18. God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled, as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. Ps. 37:29." —Ibid, p. 674.
