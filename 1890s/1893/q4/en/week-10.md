## NOTES.

1. VERSES 15, 16.—When Peter confessed that Jesus was the Son of God, the reply of Christ indicated that this truth cannot be discerned by the natural man (Matt. 16:16, 17), and it is only when Christ, in whom God dwelt (2 Cor. 5:19), is revealed in us (Gal. 1:16) that we can confess this truth in the sense of the scripture. Thus the Spirit which is to testify of him (John 15:26) witnesses through us to his divinity (1 Cor. 12:3). The love of God can be known only by experience, as it is poured out in the heart. Rom. 5:5. "Human language can never explain how the love of Christ can take possession of the soul, and lead captive every power of the mind; but you will know it by personal experience." Since God is love, and all love is of God, no one can be in love and separated from God at the same time.

2. VERSE 17.—The result aimed at in all God's love to us is that we may be restored to his favor and dwell in his presence (1 Tim. 2:4), but this involves a testing of the character (2 Cor. 5:10), and the law demands perfection (James 2:10). No righteousness of our own (Phil. 3:9) will give confidence in that day. Those who have "had a sense of the righteousness of Jehovah, and felt the terror of appearing in their guilt and uncleanness before the Searcher of hearts," will desire a robe of righteousness (Isa. 61:10) as a wedding garment (Matt. 22:11, 12), clean and white (Rev. 19:8). "None are so sinful that they cannot find strength, purity, and righteousness in Jesus, who died for them. He is waiting to strip them of their garments, stained and polluted with sin, and to put upon them the white robes of righteousness."

Our likeness to Christ must begin here. "We must perfect a Christlike character, or we shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven." "The saints in heaven will first have been saints on earth."

3. VERSE 18.—Although there is a certain fear (1 Peter 1:17) in which we are to live (Phil. 2:12), yet "not in distrust of the grace of God, but in fear that self shall gain the supremacy. We are not to fear that there will be any failure on the part of God, but fear lest because of our own sinful inclinations any of us should seem to come short of the promise." "Here is where we need to watch, to strive, to pray, that nothing may entice us to choose another master, for we are always free to do this."

God has given us every reason for assurance (Heb. 6:17, 18) that he will carry us through (Phil. 1:6) and enable us to pass the test (Jude 24), if we believe in him (2 Chron. 20:20).

4. VERSES 19-21.—"We love, because He first loved us," is the Revised Version of verse 19. We should never have known the meaning of love, and never have exercised it toward anyone, if God had not first loved us. If we love God, whom we have not seen (1 Peter 1:8), then we shall surely love all the objects of his love about us whom we can see. This love is a proof to the world of our discipleship (John 13:35). Love to God and love to man are inseparably connected (Matt. 22:37-40), and both will be manifested by the follower of Christ. "There has been too much of a spirit to ask, 'Am I my brother's keeper?' Said the angel, 'Yea, thou art thy brother's keeper. Thou shouldst have a watchful care for thy brother, be interested for his welfare, and cherish a kind, loving spirit toward him.'" "While we cannot fellowship those who are the bitter enemies of Christ, we should cultivate that spirit of meekness and love that characterized our Master,—a love that thinketh no evil, and is not easily provoked."
