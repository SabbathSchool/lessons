## Apples of Gold Library.

THIS is the title of a little monthly publication recently started by the Pacific Press Publishing Co., and is designed especially for use in personal correspondence. Each number will contain from four to eight pages of a size convenient to go into a number six envelope without folding. It is printed on thin super-calendered paper, and one or two numbers can be put in with an ordinary letter without increasing the postage.

It is the object of the publishers to present in this Library the leading themes of the Gospel, in a short, attractive style, that will at once arrest the attention and create a favorable impression, and a desire to read more. The themes presented will embrace "The Love of God," "Justification by Faith," "Christ Our Righteousness," and kindred subjects.

It is not intended that these tracts shall take the place of our BIBLE STUDENTS' LIBRARY, or other publication, but they are to be used by our brethren and sisters in their daily correspondence. A package should be kept on hand, and when writing to a friend, or any person, just inclose one or more of these tracts. It will not usually add to the postage, and in doing this work we shall be "sowing beside all waters."

We have a membership of say 40,000. Allowing that each person writes only one letter each week, it makes over two million letters per year! If each one of these letters contained a tract, what a vast amount of good might be accomplished!

We feel confident that our brethren and sisters everywhere will avail themselves of this simple method of getting the truth before the people.

The subscription price has been placed at ten cents per year, postpaid. Special discount when taken in quantities.

The price of different numbers will vary according to the number of pages they contain. It is possible that some numbers will contain more than eight pages, but not to exceed sixteen.

These tracts are published in Library style in order to secure the pound rate of postage. The first number is now ready, and is entitled "Looking unto Jesus." This number will be sent to any address at the rate of 50 cents per hundred postpaid. Sample copies free. Address,

## INTRODUCTORY.

### Analysis of the First Epistle of John.

It may assist to a clearer understanding of the portion of Scripture selected for study during this quarter if a general view of it as a whole can be obtained. The following analysis, taken from the "Cambridge Bible for Schools," may prove of some help in this direction:

**Chapter 1:1-4.—Introduction.**
1. The subject matter of the gospel employed in the epistle. Chapter 1:1-3.
2. The purpose of the epistle. Chapter 1:4.

**Chapter 1:5 to 2:28.—God Is Light.**
a. Chapter 1:5 to 2:11.—What walking in the light involves; the condition and conduct of the believer.
   1. Fellowship with God and with the brethren. Chapter 1:5-7.
   2. Consciousness and confession of sin. Chapter 1:8-10.
   3. Obedience to God-by imitation of Christ. Chapter 2:1-6.
   4. Love of the brethren. Chapter 2:7-11.

b. Chapter 2:12-28.—What walking in the light excludes,—the things and persons to be avoided.
   1. Threefold statement of reasons for writing. Chapter 2:12-14.
   2. The things to be avoided,—the world and its ways. Chapter 2:15-17.
   3. The persons to be avoided,—antichrists. Chapter 2:18-26.
   4. (Transitional) the place of safety,—Christ. Chapter 2:27, 28.

**Chapter 2:29 to 5:12.—God Is Love.**
c. Chapter 2:29 to 3:24.—The evidence of sonship,—deeds of righteousness before God.
   1. The children of God and the children of the devil. Chapter 2:29 to 3:12.
   2. Love and hate; life and death. Chapter 3:13-24.

d. Chapter 4:1 to 5:12.—The source of sonship-possession of the Spirit as shown by confession of the incarnation.
   1. The Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Chapter 4:1-6.
   2. Love is the mark of the children of Him who is love. Chapter 4:7-21.
   3. Faith is the source of love, the victory over the world, and the possession of life. Chapter 5:1-12.

**Chapter 5:13-21.—Conclusion.**
1. Intercessory love the fruit of faith. Chapter 5:13-17.
2. The sum of the Christian's knowledge. Chapter 5:18-20.
3. Final injunction. Chapter 5:21.

Perhaps our first impression on looking at the headings of the smaller sections would be that these subjects have not much connection with one another, and that the order in which they come is more or less a matter of accident. This impression would be erroneous. Fellowship with God involves consciousness of sin, and its confession with a view to its removal. This implies obedience to God, which finds its highest expression in love. Love of God and of the brethren excludes love of the world, which is passing away, as is shown by the appearance of antichrists. He who would not pass away must abide in Christ. With the idea of sonship, introduced by the expression "begotten of God," the epistle takes a fresh start. This divine sonship implies mutual love among God's children and the indwelling of Christ, to which the Spirit testifies. The mention of the Spirit leads on to the distinction between true and false spirits. By a rather subtle connection this once more leads to the topic of mutual love, and to faith as the source of love, especially as shown in intercessory prayer. The whole closes with a summary of the knowledge on which the moral principles inculcated in the epistle are based, and with a warning against idols.

The main characteristics of this epistle, says Barnes, are these: 1. It is full of love. The writer dwells on it; places it in a variety of attitudes; enforces the duty of loving one another by a great variety of considerations, and shows that it is essential to the very nature of religion. 2. The epistle abounds with statements on the evidences of piety, or the characteristics of true religion. . . . A large part of the epistle is occupied with this, and there is perhaps no portion of the New Testament which one could study to more advantage who is desirous of ascertaining whether he himself is a true Christian. An anxious inquirer, a man who wishes to know what true religion is, could be directed to no portion of the New Testament where he would more readily find the instruction that he needs, than to this portion of the writings of the aged and experienced disciple whom Jesus loved. A true Christian can find nowhere else a more clear statement of the nature of his religion, and of the evidences of real piety, than in this epistle.

## NOTE

The portion of Scripture designated for each lesson should be so thoroughly studied that every question can be answered in the exact words of the text. The questions are framed with the purpose to make this possible. It is hoped that the notes will be found suggestive and helpful in the further development of the thought of the lesson. Teachers should encourage a careful study of the ideas presented, and, above all, should seek to make such a practical application of the subject matter as will be a help in personal experience.
