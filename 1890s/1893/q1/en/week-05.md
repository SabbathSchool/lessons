### NOTE

Man was originally created in God's image (Gen. 1:27), "perfect in his being and in harmony with God," but his nature became changed through transgression. The whole purpose of the plan of salvation is that the image of God may be restored in the soul and the creature again be in harmony with the Creator. Sin has brought enmity (Rom. 8:7), but God's purpose is peace (Jer. 29:11) through Christ (Eph. 2:14). But the heart is the source of evil (Mark 7:21-23), which separates from God (Isa. 59:2), and man cannot of himself change it (Job 14:4) and do good (Jer. 13:23). There must be a death of the body of sin (Rom. 6:6), a burial (verse 4), and a new life unto God (verse 11) through Christ. A complete change is wrought (2 Cor. 5:17), which is nothing less than creation (Gal. 6:15, Revised Version, margin). Then good works can be done (Eph. 2:10) through the power working in us (Col. 1:29), which is God in Christ (Phil. 2:13), and which is the same power that gives life to the dead (Eph. 1:19, 20). Thus redemption is simply "a new creation," and the gospel is the same creative power manifested in salvation (Rom. 1:16). But we have learned that this creative power is in God's word (lesson 3), and it is equally true whether applied to the creation of a world or a new heart. Through faith in his promises our natures may be changed (2 Peter 1:4) by the power of his word. Our ground of hope is that our Creator is our Redeemer (read Isaiah 43 and 44), and he is our Strength (Isa. 26:4) and our Salvation (Isa. 12:2). When he speaks righteousness in place of sin (Rom. 3:25), and "is declaring righteous" the ungodly (Rom. 4:5, Young's translation), we are to believe in the power of his word supplying the fact. "God makes a man righteous by counting him so. This is the divine paradox of justification by faith."

4. To whom does the Sabbath mean the most?
5. How may the Sabbath be a constant encouragement to us in Christian experience?
