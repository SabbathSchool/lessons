### NOTES

1. The covenant mentioned by Jeremiah "had existed by the promise of God since the first intimation of redemption had been given. It had been accepted by faith; yet, when ratified by Christ, it is called a new covenant." "That the new covenant was valid in the days of Abraham is evident from the fact that it was then confirmed both by the promise and by the oath of God." Heb. 6:17, 18.

2. In the new covenant the law is written in the heart by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:3), just as it was in Christ's heart (Ps. 40:8). The word of God being spirit and life (John 6:63), when in the heart keeps from sin (Ps. 119:11), and establishes the righteous in the way (Ps. 37:31). The law of God "is an expression of the will of God," "the transcript of the character of God." In Christ this character was illustrated. "He gave to man a new interpretation of God." He was the Word made flesh (John 1:14), and thus, when the law of God is in the heart, it is simply Christ in us the hope of glory (Col. 1:27).

3. Isaac was a child of faith (Heb. 11:11), and so of promise (Rom. 9:9). It is only children of promise who are children of God (verse 8). Such are born of the Spirit, and through faith become partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). These promises are the better promises (Heb. 8:6), even the promises of God. All who are now depending upon their own promises merely to obey God, have been born after the flesh only, and are in bondage (John 8:34). It is our privilege to be free (verse 32), and as sons to abide in the house ever (verse 35, Revised Version), and not to be cast out (Matt. 22:13).
