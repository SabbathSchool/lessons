### NOTES

1. Paul knew whom he had believed (2 Tim. 1:12), and was aware that it made a great difference how the word was received (1 Cor. 2:4, 5). The difference between God's word and man's word is just as great as the difference between God and man, which is simply infinite. See Ps. 146:3; Isa. 26:4; 1 Cor. 1:25. God's word works in those who believe it as God's word. The gospel "is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth" (Rom. 1:16), and the word of the Lord is preached by the gospel (1 Peter 1:25), but it must be believed in order to be of profit (Heb. 4:2).

2. Man puts his own thoughts into words (Luke 6:45), and what one man has thus clothed with language, another man can study out, and so exhaust his meaning. Not so with God's word. His words contain a depth of meaning which only his Spirit can reveal to us (1 Cor. 2:11, 12), and for this purpose was the Spirit promised (John 16:13; 1 Cor. 2:10). As rain and snow are sent upon the earth to accomplish definite results, so God sends his word (Ps. 107:20; Matt. 8:8). It is sent to bring salvation (Acts 13:26; James 1:21), and it will accomplish this for all who receive it. As the land is made fruitful by receiving the rain (Heb. 6:7), so God will cause righteousness to spring forth (Isa. 61:11). When spoken faithfully the word will have a powerful effect (Jer. 23:28, 29), and it is able to build up (Acts 20:32) those who receive it.

3. The Revised Version of Heb. 4:12 is as follows: "For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart." The words of God are not only living words, but they are spirit and life (John 6:63) to those who believe them. Life seems to belong to everything that is associated with God. He not only has life in himself (John 5:26) but his throne is a living throne (Ezekiel 1). Besides this we have the word of life (Phil. 2:16), the breath of life (Gen. 2:7), the bread of life (John 6:48), the river of life, and the tree of life (Rev. 22:1, 2). The word is the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17), for the Spirit dwells in the word (compare James 1:18 and 1 Peter 1:23 with John 3:5), and so it is said of Christ, who spoke for God (John 3:34), that a sharp two-edged sword went out of his mouth (Rev. 1:16).

4. Christ is called the Word of God (Rev. 19:11-13), not only because he spoke the words of God (Deut. 18:18; John 17:8), but also because he was a living proclamation to the world of the character of God (2 Cor. 5:19; John 14:9, 10). The mystery of the incarnation, God with us (Matt. 1:23), divinity veiled in humanity, is repeated in the word in which the divine Spirit dwells in human language. "The union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ, exists also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God;' yet they are expressed in the words of men, and are adapted to human needs. Thus it may be said of the Book of God, as it was of Christ, that 'the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.' And this fact, so far from being an argument against the Bible, should strengthen faith in it as the word of God. Those who pronounce upon the inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as divine, while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact that Christ, the divine, partook of our human nature, that he might reach humanity. In the work of God for man's redemption, divinity and humanity are combined." As Christ is a personal Saviour (Gal. 2:20), so God's word is given to each one as an individual. "The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul for whom he gave his beloved Son." His word is to be regarded by each one as though he were the only one to whom God had thus spoken.
