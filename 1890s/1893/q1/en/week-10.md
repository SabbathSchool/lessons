### NOTE

Abraham exercised the faith which brought righteousness before he received circumcision (Gen. 15:5, 6; 17:10). This was a sign or seal of the inward work. Now God has given a different sign or seal of the same inward work. Now every true Jew is a Christian, and every Christian is a Jew (Gal. 3:29). Now circumcision is of the heart only; then it was in the flesh as a type of that of the heart (Deut. 10:16; 30:6). The blessing of Abraham is righteousness by faith, and this comes through the work of Christ. Having attained to this blessing through believing (Rom. 3:22; 10:10), we then receive the seal of righteousness (Eph. 1:13), which is the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30). God gave of his Spirit without measure to Christ (John 3:34), thus witnessing to the fullness of his righteousness. The 144,000 are without fault (Rev. 14:5), and as a sign that they are all righteous (Isa. 60:21) they have received the latter rain (Zech. 10:1), as the children of Israel were all circumcised just before taking possession of the promised land (Josh. 5:2).
