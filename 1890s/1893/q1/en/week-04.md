### NOTES

1. Man lost his life by the first act of disobedience (Gen. 2:17). By the mercy and forbearance of God, probation has been granted to him; but life has been forfeited by sin (Eph. 2:1). Death has been abolished and life brought to light through the gospel (2 Tim. 1:10), which is the power of God (Rom. 1:16), and the basis of which is his word (1 Peter 1:25). This word is life, and when received as the word of God (1 Thess. 2:13) it begets new life in the believer. The word is both spirit and life (John 6:63); and so the Spirit is spoken of as the agency in the new birth. "Like the wind, which is invisible, yet the effects of which are plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon the human heart. That regenerating power, which no human eye can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new being in the image of God." This work is beyond the power of man to accomplish (John 1:13), and everyone in whom it is wrought is said to know God (1 John 4:7), or to be known of God (Gal. 4:9), and to be born of God (1 John 5:1, 18). Thus, to know God is eternal life (John 17:3), and through this knowledge blessings are multiplied to us (2 Peter 1:2). In this knowledge one may glory (Jer. 9:23, 24). God's Spirit is a spirit of knowledge (Isa. 11:2), and is given to guide us into all truth (John 16:13), and is superior to any merely human teacher (1 John 2:27); but it works through the word in which it dwells. It is in this way that it defeats the enemy (Isa. 59:19), and witnesses to our acceptance with God (Rom. 8:16) by bringing the word of God to our remembrance (John 14:26).

2. Water is used as a symbol of cleansing (1 Peter 3:21); but the power is in the word (Eph. 5:25-27), by which we are made clean (John 15:3), through the spirit which dwells in it (Titus 3:5). Christ is also called the Word (John 1:1), and in him is life (John 1:4; 5:26) and the power to give life (1 Cor. 15:45, Revised Version). So when we receive him, which is done by believing on him (John 1:12; Eph. 3:17), we have life (1 John 5:12), Christ himself dwelling in us (Gal. 2:20) by his word (Col. 3:16). So we feed upon him (John 6:57) in studying his word (Jer. 15:16). Thus the same Word, by which all things were created in the beginning, begets by the same power a new life in the believer.
