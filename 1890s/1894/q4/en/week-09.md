## CONDEMNING THE JUST
### Luke 23:13-31

This portion of the book needs the most careful study, as the things related are of infinite importance. It is not vague, dreamy meditation that does us good. We are to meditate upon the sufferings of Christ for us; but this means more than that we are to think in a general way that He was betrayed and condemned and crucified. We should read and reread the story of His betrayal, His suffering in the garden, the reproaches that were heaped upon Him, His crucifixion and resurrection, until every event becomes a living reality to us, and we can see Him set forth evidently crucified among us. Then as, tracing the narrative through in our meditation, we see what it all meant, we may be able to say, "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me." Gal. 2:20. Nothing can give this vivid conception except the very words of the Scripture; therefore study them above all things. Review, REVIEW, REVIEW. "Give thyself wholly to them."

## NOTE

1. Three times Pilate bore witness to the innocence of Jesus, but as soon as he began to parley with the people, he lost all influence with them. When he gave sentence, it was that "it should be as they required." He simply delivered up Jesus to a mob, in order to save himself. If he had utterly refused to deliver Jesus to their will, he would, no doubt, have been accused to the emperor, and have been deposed, which was what actually took place, after all. Every man is to some extent in the same position that Pilate was. "What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ?" is a question which comes to everyone. Selfish interest clamors that He be given up. If He be kept, loss of position, of business, or of friends, may be the result. And so too often Christ is delivered up, and in doing so, in order to save their life, they lose it, for He is the only one who can bestow life. There is no one who is in a position to condemn either Peter or Pilate. Our fear and selfishness have often caused us to deny Jesus, or to pursue a vacillating course that ended in defeat. And yet He abides faithful.
