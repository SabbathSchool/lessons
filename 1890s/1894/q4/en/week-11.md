## NOTE

In this lesson there is the clearest evidence as to the day of the Sabbath, and also to the fact that there has never been any change made in it. It is the evidence of the Holy Spirit, who inspired the writing of the record years after the events took place. Let us note a few points:â€”

(a) The day on which Jesus was crucified was the preparation day. Ex. 16:22, 23 tells us what day was the preparation for the Sabbath. It was the sixth day of the week.

(b) The women went at once and bought the spices and ointments, and then they "rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment."

(c) It was the first day of the week when they came to the sepulcher to anoint Jesus. They came very early in the morning, yet "the Sabbath was past." Mark 16:1. Therefore, since the Sabbath was the very day before they came to the sepulcher, and they came to the sepulcher on the first day of the week, and there are only seven days in a week, it is very plain that "the Sabbath day according to the commandment" is the seventh day of the week.

So that, although the fourth commandment does not use the word "week" when it says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath," the Scripture plainly tells us that it is not an indefinite seventh part of time that is meant, but the definite seventh day of the week.

(d) We do not count anything on the example of the disciples. Human example is not what we are to follow. We are not to keep the Sabbath because they did, but for the same reason that they did, namely, because the commandment of God requires it. Moreover, it makes not the slightest difference that Jesus had not yet risen from the dead when the disciples rested on the seventh day of the week. It is the Holy Spirit that records the fact, and He calls the seventh day of the week "the Sabbath day according to the commandment." Whatever men may say of the Old Testament, there is no disagreement about the fact that the New Testament was written for Christians, and that the language of the New Testament is the language for Christians. Therefore the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath for Christians, and the first day of the week is an ordinary working day.
