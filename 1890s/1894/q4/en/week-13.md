# LESSON 13 - December 29, 1894

## THE ASCENSION
### Luke 24:36-53

We come now to the last lesson of the year, and to the close of the book of Luke. There is only one thing to say, and that is, Read, read; review, review. Pursue the same plan in all your study of the Bible. Do not let it degenerate into a mere intellectual exercise; this the study of the Bible should never be, and yet it will be found that there is nothing so healthful and strengthening to the intellect as the proper study of the Bible. The greatest benefits from this study of Luke are yet to come. They will come in the shape of a greater facility in acquiring a knowledge of any other portion of Scripture, but especially in the light and instruction that will dawn upon your minds as you think upon the things which you have outlined during the past study. You will find that the more thoroughly you have studied the lessons, the more you are now able to learn from the same scripture that you have been studying. Many precious truths have doubtless been impressed upon your minds as you have been studying; but the one thing that is the most valuable of all, if you have learned it, is the knowledge of the fact that the light and truth come from the very words of the Scripture. If you have learned to inquire of the Scriptures themselves, and to let them speak to you, and teach you, you have learned the secret of the knowledge of God.

## NOTE

"And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy." This may seem strange when we remember how sorrowful they were when they heard of His going away, until we read the record in the first chapter of Acts: "And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven." This was the cause of their joy as they returned to Jerusalem. The same promise is made to every one of us, and should cause the same joy in our hearts. It will surely do so if, like them, we have walked and talked with Jesus, and have had our hearts burn within us at His gracious words. "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls." 1 Peter 1:8, 9. And so, as we read His words, "Surely I come quickly," which are so much nearer fulfillment now than when first spoken, we shall respond, with the disciple whom Jesus loved, and who loved Him, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
