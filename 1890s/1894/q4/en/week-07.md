## NOTES

1. "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin." Heb. 12:1-4. Christ did resist unto blood, striving against sin. "His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground." There was the temptation for Him to refuse to go on with the work assigned Him. No man can ever realize the strength of the temptation that beset Christ in the garden. If He had failed then, Satan would have triumphed as surely as he would if he had overcome Christ in the wilderness. Christ endured the cross, despising the shame, and we may also expect to pass through severe suffering, but it will be with Him. An angel strengthened Him, and we have the assurance, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." 1 Cor. 10:13. "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin." 1 Peter 4:1.

2. "And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. . . . And Peter went out, and wept bitterly." There is power in a look of the Saviour. There was no condemnation in that look, but love and pity. It melted the heart of Peter to repentance. People often use the words, "Thou God seest me," as a means of frightening children into obedience. They are taught to think that it is a terrible thing for the Lord to see them. Not so would the Lord have us regard His looks. There is salvation in His look. The Lord says: "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word." Isa. 66:2. "Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved." Ps. 80:19.
