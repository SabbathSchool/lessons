# LESSON 4 â€” January 27, 1894

## THE PROPHECY OF ZACHARIAS, AND THE BIRTH OF CHRIST

### Luke 1:67 to 2:7

The heading of this lesson is a sufficient analysis. It contains just those two topics. The remainder of the first chapter of Luke, from verse 67, with the exception of the last verse, consists of the thanksgiving and prophecy uttered by Zacharias. The first seven verses of chapter 2 relate the simple incidents connected with the birth of Christ. Since in this lesson we complete the first chapter of Luke, let us briefly summarize it, so that we can ever after carry with us a picture of its contents: Introduction; Gabriel's visit to Zacharias; Gabriel's visit to Mary; Mary's visit to Elizabeth; birth of John the Baptist; prophecy of Zacharias. If the chapter has been carefully studied, this synopsis will serve to bring to mind all the details.

2. For what did he bless the God of Israel?
3. What did he say that God had raised up?
4. How had God spoken this promise?
5. From what had God promised that his people should be saved?
6. What did Zacharias say that God had remembered?
7. To whom was this covenant made, and how sure was it?
8. What deliverance was granted by this covenant?
9. What does this deliverance from our enemies enable us to do?

23. As the little, helpless Infant lay in the manger, what command was given? Heb. 1:6.

### NOTES

1. "He hath visited and redeemed His people." This was literally true. God had visited his people; he had redeemed them. Many times had he wrought special deliverance for them, and continually had he been at work redeeming souls from destruction. And now at the birth of John the people were about to see God's promise confirmed by the blood of Christ, even as it had been long before by his oath.

2. This redemption "from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us," is salvation from sin. This is shown by the fact that, "being delivered out of the hand of our enemies," we are able to "serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him, all the days of our life." God does deliver from sin and from the power of darkness, for that is the sole purpose for which Christ came into the world.

3. The deliverance from sin is in performance of the oath of God to Abraham. It is a manifestation of the mercy of God. It is salvation, the knowledge of which comes "by the remission of sin." And this is what the promise to Abraham embraced. "For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith." Rom. 4:13.

4. There is power in the mercy of God. The Psalmist says: "For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great [literally, "so mighty"] is his mercy toward them that fear him." Ps. 103:11. The tender mercy of our God can cleanse from sin, and can do for us "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think." Eph. 3:20.

5. "As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began." All the prophets gave witness to Christ; and in them all is taught the remission of sins through faith in him. See Acts 10:43. They testify not only of the sufferings of Christ, but of the glory to follow. 1 Peter 1:10, 11. In fact, there is nothing else in the Bible but salvation through Christ, for that is the one work that God is doing for man. Moreover, this salvation does not rest on the authority of man. It was God who spoke by the mouth of his apostles and prophets. See Acts 1:16; 3:21; 4:25; 2 Sam. 23:1, 2. Paul says: "When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe." 1 Thess. 2:13. Thus the Bible is literally and emphatically the word of God. If we receive it as such, we may as truly hear God speak to us as did Abraham, although not with an audible voice. But it is as truly the word of God, and is as fresh, as if we heard it with our ears.
