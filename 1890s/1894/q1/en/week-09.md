# LESSON 9 â€” March 3, 1894

## PREACHING WITH POWER

### Luke 4:22-44

As heretofore, before taking up the advance lesson, review the preceding ones, especially the last. Our last lesson left Jesus in the synagogue, with the people's hearts burning and responding as he uttered gracious words, proclaiming liberty to the captives of sin. But now we hear the people beginning to question and doubt, and soon the blessed influence of the word is gone. Jesus showed them by illustrations from the past that because of their unbelief they would be passed by, and others whom they despised would be saved. After his expulsion from the synagogue, he came to Capernaum and preached. Verses 33-37 relate the casting out of a devil from a man in the synagogue; verses 38, 39 tell of the instantaneous healing of Peter's wife's mother; and the remaining verses tell of his healing multitudes of people.

The lesson may be summarized thus: Jesus rejected at Nazareth; preaching in Capernaum; casting out an unclean devil in the synagogue; healing Peter's wife's mother and multitudes of others.

### NOTES

1. "And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?" And with that saying they lost the blessing that they had received. The fact that their hearts burned within them as Jesus spoke to them from the word, and that the blessing of God came upon them as he set forth the application of the scripture, was evidence of the truthfulness of Christ's claim. If they had cherished the light that came to them, a flood of light would have burst upon them, and mighty miracles would have been wrought among them. But unbelief shut out light. Only those who believe can understand. The righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith. Rom. 1:17. "By faith we understand." Heb. 11:3. Let men who count it a virtue to question and criticize, who think that it is a sign of a strong mind to doubt, and of a weak mind to believe without cavil, learn a lesson from the men of Nazareth.

2. In the reference to Elijah and Elisha, Jesus showed the people why he could not do the works in Nazareth that he had done in Capernaum. They did not believe. His miracles were not done to gratify curiosity, nor to break down unbelieving prejudice, but to bless those who felt the need of blessing. The widows of Israel might have had the blessing of Elijah's presence, if they had believed. But only the poor widow of Sarepta, in Phoenicia, had faith enough to receive the prophet. The lepers in Israel might have been healed, but none of them had faith. But Naaman, the Syrian, was healed, because he believed. It was no injustice to the Jews that they were passed by. As Paul at a later date said to other unbelieving Jews, they judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life. See Acts 13:46. These cases to which Jesus referred showed that God is no respecter of persons. He puts no difference between Jew and Gentile. All are alike in his sight, and all have an equal chance of salvation, since all must receive it by faith. Rom. 4:16. The words of Jesus implied the rejection of the Jews, because of their unbelief, and the salvation of the despised Gentiles who would believe; therefore the Jews were filled with anger. Behold how quickly a little doubt will turn one who is rejoicing in the light into a bitter persecutor! The people of Nazareth furnish a notable example of "men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness." Rom. 1:18, Revised Version. "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God." Heb. 3:12.

3. "And they were astonished at his doctrine [teaching]; for his word was with power." How powerful the word was is shown by the miracle that followed. Right here, at the beginning of the record of the miracles, by Luke, let us stop to note why they were recorded. John writes: "And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name." John 20:30, 31. With a word Jesus healed Peter's wife's mother. From a raging fever, she was brought by the word of Jesus to perfect health and strength. With a word Jesus cast out the devils. "And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out." Why do we not more readily learn the lesson that these miracles were intended to convey, namely, that there is power in the word of Jesus to cleanse from sin? We cannot understand how he can cleanse from sin, any more than the people of Capernaum could understand how the unclean spirits could be cast out with a word; but those instances were placed on record so that we might believe it without understanding it. There is a mighty power in the word of God. If in time of temptation, and in all times when the Spirit brings some word to our remembrance, we would yield ourselves to its power, we should have proved to us that it is both living and powerful. Heb. 4:12. The miracles of Christ are object lessons for us. They show us the power of Christ to cleanse and save from sin. It is the spirit of Satan that works in the children of disobedience (Eph. 2:1, 2); but Christ is as able to cast out evil spirits now as he was then, for he says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." Matt. 28:18.
