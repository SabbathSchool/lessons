## LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE

To explain any of the book, but only to set some of it forth in bold relief. It is simply what is stated in the title, a study, and a foundation for future study. It is an attempt to assist the members of Sabbath schools, and others, also, to obtain such a familiarity with the contents of this portion of the Scriptures that they may study it for themselves, and that, having studied it, they may retain the results of their study.

The plan of the lessons is this: First, there is given a brief analysis of the passage comprising the lesson. In addition to this there is, after the first lesson, a synopsis of that which has been passed over, in order to preserve the connection and to assist in reviewing. Next come a few questions for the purpose of bringing out the main features of the narrative. These questions are confined quite closely to the text of the lesson; then there follow short notes pointing out some lessons to be learned from the text, and suggesting other illustrative scriptures. In these notes doctrinal points in the lesson are developed, and they will be found to afford a basis for many more questions than are given in the lesson. It has been thought better to leave the questions on these doctrinal suggestions to the discretion and tact of the individual teacher, than to frame them for him.

In studying the lesson first read thoughtfully several times the verses that it includes. In doing so, form a definite statement in your own mind of the topic or topics that it treats upon. Compare this analysis with the analysis given in this book. By this means you will be able to grasp and hold the outline, and it will serve to bring to your mind the details, so that, in order to remember the contents of a chapter which you have studied, you have to carry in your mind only a few points. The details are, of course, fastened in the mind only by frequent and careful reading of them, so that a mention of the subject presents a picture of all the details.

Having done this, you will be able, without any difficulty, to answer the questions that are in the lesson, or any other questions that may be asked upon the text itself. Then you may compare the scriptures suggested in the notes, and any other scriptures that may suggest themselves to your mind as parallel. It is hoped that by this means the student will have, at the close of the series, not only a thorough knowledge of the contents of the book of Luke, together with a good idea of the truth embraced in it, but also such experience as will enable him to take up any portion of Scripture and study it for himself. If these lessons shall contribute a little toward making the members of the Sabbath schools Bible students, their object will have been gained.

We would suggest that the teachers and superintendents adopt the plan of frequent topical review of that which the classes have passed over. Do not get the idea that it is necessary to try to remember just how many verses are devoted to each topic in any lesson. This would be too mechanical. The number is noted in the synopsis simply to make the analysis more clear, but all that is necessary to do in learning is to remember the order of occurrence of the different topics. The following will be found an excellent plan: After having completed a chapter, state the topics of that chapter in order, in your own words. At the close of each chapter, review in this way all the chapters from the beginning. In these reviews do not go into the details of the topics, but simply indicate, in the fewest words possible, the subjects treated of in the narrative. You will be surprised to see how soon you will be able to give, in their order, the complete contents of any chapter that you have studied. This will be an excellent drill for each student by himself. Besides familiarizing him with the Scriptures, it will be one of the best possible means of disciplining the mind.

It may be of assistance to some to state that the questions are invariably upon the text of the lesson to which they are appended, unless accompanied by a reference to some other text. They are designed simply to aid the student in gaining familiarity with the lesson narrative, and not for the teacher in the class. Their object in the case of the student is to prompt him to note all the details of the lesson narrative. The teacher, however, will in the class pay no attention to the questions, but will have the entire subject so well in his mind that he can draw it from the pupils by questions of his own framing. If, however, he finds himself unable at any time to do this, then let him ask his questions from the open Bible before him, and not from the lesson quarterly. In all cases remember that the Bible, and not the lesson pamphlet, is the book to be studied.

If the pupils have not become so familiar with the text that they can readily answer questions upon the narrative, let them answer from the Bible. It is better to give a correct answer from the Bible than to give an incorrect one by guess; but thoroughness and exactness should be the aim. Instead of asking questions every time, the skillful teacher will often ask the members of the class to give in order the facts recorded in the lesson, asking questions only to draw out the pupil's understanding of those facts, and the lessons taught by them.

This pamphlet should be preserved, as the hints and suggestions which it contains in regard to study and teaching will be needed throughout the year.
