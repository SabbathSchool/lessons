# LESSON 6 — February 10, 1894

## JESUS IN THE TEMPLE

### Luke 2:34-52

Our last lesson left Jesus in the temple, in the arms of Simeon, closing with Simeon's thanksgiving to God. Joseph and Mary marveled, and Simeon turned and blessed them, addressing to Mary a prophecy concerning Jesus. At that moment Anna, an aged prophetess, came in, and, recognizing Jesus as the Saviour, gave thanks to the Lord, and went and spoke of him "to all them that looked for redemption in Israel." Joseph and Mary returned to Nazareth, where Jesus remained until he was twelve years old, when he went up to Jerusalem to the passover, with his parents. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to relating the losing of Jesus, and how he was found in the temple, questioning the learned doctors of the law, and amazing them with his answers to their questions.

The words "Simeon and Anna," and "Jesus among the doctors," will furnish a good outline upon which to build the details of the lesson.

### NOTES

1. In verses 34 and 35 we have a brief prophecy of the earthly ministry and the death of Jesus. Christ was sent for the fall and rising of many in Jerusalem. While he was, according to the prophet, to be a sanctuary, he was also to be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. Isa. 8:14. That over which some stumble, lifts others up. All might find upbuilding in him if they would.

2. "That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed." The thoughts that rule in men's hearts are revealed by the various ways in which they regard Jesus. Simeon and Anna had no difficulty in recognizing who Jesus was. It was because their hearts were continually open to receive instruction from God. They knew the voice of God when he spoke to them. God speaks to men now just as surely and as plainly as he did to them, but few recognize his voice. In the Bible we have God's word. Christ dwells in the word; for he is the Word. Yet how many read and hear the burning words of inspiration, and do not recognize Christ in them. Are not such as culpable as the priests and doctors of old, who did not see in the child before them the Son of God, the Lord of all? We are apt to think that people in those days were very blind, and can hardly have patience with them for their unbelief, and then we go and act over again their very failings. Why do we not learn from the unbelief as well as from the faith of the men of old? What blessedness would come to us, if we would receive the "consolation of Israel" as readily as did Simeon.

3. "After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers." That was an exhibition of divine wisdom, for Christ in his humanity was never separated from divinity. Why was that recorded? Was it simply to show us the wonderful wisdom of Jesus, that we may admire it?—No, for Christ was an example for men. It was written that we may know that the same heavenly wisdom may be ours if Christ dwells in our hearts by faith. Christ is declared to be "the power of God and the wisdom of God." 1 Cor. 1:24. And God has made him unto us wisdom. Verse 30. He is to us wisdom and righteousness. Now, just as all the righteousness of Christ may be ours by faith, so with wisdom, when we have the Spirit of Christ, so that we can use it with his humility, and not be puffed up. This is really too wonderful a thought to be grasped, but we know that God is able to do for us "exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think." Eph. 3:20.

4. "And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them." Two things may be learned from this: First, the simplicity of Jesus. He did not "put on airs" because of his great wisdom. There was not a doctor in Jerusalem whose knowledge exceeded that of this twelve-year-old child, yet he was as void of self-consciousness, and as obedient, as it was possible for a child to be. What wonders may be wrought even in children, if Christ dwells in them. He lived the life of a child that he might give his life to children, and live in them the Christ life while yet they remain little children. All who are saved, both old and young, are "saved by his life" (Rom. 5:10), that is, by his life in us instead of our life of self (see Gal. 2:20). And so we may learn, as far at least as the fifth commandment is concerned, that Christ is made unto us righteousness, that is, the law of God. Christ is the same "yesterday, and to-day, and forever." Heb. 13:8. He lives the same life now that he always did—the same that he did on earth. So when Christ lives in any soul, there will be manifest obedience to parents, and reverence for authority. He in whose heart Christ dwells, has the law of God in his heart, and its righteousness manifested in his life.

5. "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." Here is an illustration of the mystery of divine perfection and divine growth. Jesus was no less the Son of God when he lay in the manger in Bethlehem, or when he was subject to Joseph and Mary at Nazareth, than he was at his baptism or on the mount of transfiguration. When he was brought into the world, the command went forth, "Let all the angels of God worship him." Heb. 1:6. Yet he increased in wisdom and in favor with God, even as he increased in stature. He was perfect all the time, yet he grew in grace. So we, if we believe in him, are "complete in him" (Col. 2:10), yet we are to "grow up into him in all things" (Eph. 4:15); to "grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 3:18). As Christ is infinite, so if we are in him we have possibilities of infinite growth. The Christian is to be perfect, even as his Father in heaven is perfect, yet he will never get to the place where there is no more opportunity for growth, where there is nothing more for him beyond. Perfection is found only in growth, not in cessation of growth. The plant may be a perfect plant every day, yet it is far different at the close of the year from what it was at the beginning. A perfect specimen of a plant one month after planting, will be very far from perfect if it presents exactly the same appearance six months later. When a tree stops growing, it dies. Its perfection consists in its living and growing. "The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon." Ps. 92:12.
