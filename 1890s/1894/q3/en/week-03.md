# LESSON 3 - July 21, 1894
## PREPARING FOR HIS COMING
### Luke 12:41-59; 13:1-5

In studying this lesson, do not forget to review the whole chapter until you can "think through" the whole of it. This lesson is rather difficult of close analysis, and perhaps the heading of the lesson may be sufficient to indicate that portion of it which is in the twelfth chapter. Close study will enable you to master the details. The necessity for repentance may serve to keep in mind the subject of the first five verses of the thirteenth chapter, although it does not indicate all the lesson that is to be learned from them.

### NOTES

1. The gospel of Christ is the "gospel of peace" (Eph. 6:16), yet it causes division and strife, because of the hardness of men's hearts. The Lord, through the Psalmist, says, "I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war." Ps. 120:7.

2. Do not make the mistake of trying to make an application of all the details of the illustration in the close of chapter twelve. Remember that we are not told what the adversary, the officer, the magistrate, and the judge signify, or that they are designed to have any particular significance. Consequently, any attempt to apply them in detail, as to God, the law, Satan, etc., can be nothing but idle speculation. In the absence of any application of the terms in the Scripture, it is sufficient to be admonished by the illustration to give diligence to be at peace with God, and to be delivered from the bondage of sin.

3. Christ teaches that it is a mistake to suppose that every calamity is a punishment for some specific sin. This is shown, not only in the present lesson, but in John 9:1-3. The entire book of Job shows the same thing. Jesus does not say that these Galileans and the others were not sinners, but that they were no greater sinners than others who had received no injury. Read the seventy-third psalm, and learn that God does not settle accounts in this life; and read also the book of Job, to learn that affliction is not necessarily a sign of God's displeasure. See also James 5:11.
