# LESSON 5 - August 4, 1894
## HUMBLED AND EXALTED
### Luke 13:31-35; 14:1-14

The thirteenth chapter closes with the touching account of Christ's slighted love for Jerusalem. Review the entire chapter so that you can give the leading topics, not forgetting previous chapters. In that part of the lesson included in the fourteenth chapter we have the healing of the man with the dropsy, instruction concerning self-exaltation and the exaltation that comes from humility, and instruction as to invitations to a feast.

### NOTES

1. It would be a matter of interest to collect all the recorded instances of healing on the Sabbath. We should find that they are very numerous. Some of Christ's most remarkable cures were performed on the Sabbath. What was His object in this? If we recall what a burdensome yoke the scribes and Pharisees and lawyers had made of the commandments and of the whole service of God, and then remember that the commandments of God are not grievous, but are ordained unto life, we shall see the reason. It was to let people know that the Sabbath should be a day of joy and blessing.

2. We have the choice given us whether we will receive our reward now or in the future. God does not bestow His rewards until the second coming of Christ (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12); and therefore whatever reward we get now must consist wholly in the empty applause of our fellowmen. But they who are content to wait till the coming of the Lord and the resurrection, will receive eternal riches.
