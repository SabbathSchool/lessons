# LESSON 12 - September 22, 1894
## A SON OF ABRAHAM
### Luke 19:1-27

Do not forget to review the chapters that have already been passed over. Repetition and continual association are the secret of success in learning. Not only frequently read the entire book, from the beginning up to the place of present study, but think as you read, and exercise yourself in recalling the subjects contained in any particular chapter. Here is the Bible rule for studying the word of God: "Thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." This lesson is so simple in outline that the student will be left to analyze it for himself.

1. As Jesus entered and passed through Jericho, who desired to see Him?
2. What was this man's standing in society?
3. What difficulty did he find in seeing Jesus?
4. How did he get a view of Him?
5. What did Jesus do when He reached the place where Zaccheus was?
6. How did Zaccheus receive the Lord?
7. What did the people say when they saw it?
8. What did Zaccheus say when Jesus came to his house?
9. What assurance did Jesus give him?
10. For what purpose did He say He had come?
11. What did Jesus then proceed to give?
12. Why was this parable given?
13. Relate the parable in detail. If any hesitate in this narrative, or lose the connection, let the teacher prompt them, not by telling the thing, but by asking questions.

### NOTES

1. "And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham." Zaccheus was no more a lineal descendant of Abraham than were those to whom John the Baptist and Jesus spoke when they told them that they were not Abraham's children. See Luke 3:8; John 8:33-44. What constituted him a son of Abraham? Was it what Zaccheus had done? He had done nothing good. Was it because of his promise? We have no record that even Abraham ever made any promises to the Lord. We have only the record of the promises of God to Abraham. The secret lies in the fact that Zaccheus gladly received the Lord. He was a sinner, but the Lord seeks to come in and dwell with just such people. Rev. 3:17-20. The receiving of Jesus brings salvation, and makes one a child of Abraham. "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29. "They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham." Verse 7.

2. The parable of the pounds is an illustration of the kingdom of God, for the Saviour gave it for the express purpose of correcting some wrong ideas concerning the kingdom. From it we may learn that Christ did not have His kingdom when He was here on earth. He was like a nobleman who went to receive a kingdom and to return. When He returns, it will be in His kingdom. See Matt. 25:31, 34; 2 Tim. 4:1. We are also to learn that no one here has anything that he has not received, and therefore no one has any right to boast over another. See 1 Cor. 4:7. Compare Luke 19:26 with Luke 8:18. That which is taken away from men at the last is not that which they have in their own right, but that which has been lent them to trade with, and which they have not used. They only seem to have it. No injustice is done them, for they never had anything of their own, and they refused the capital which was provided them.
