# LESSON 13 - September 29, 1894
## TRIUMPHANT ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM
### Luke 19:28-48

Do not fail to notice how few subjects are embraced in this chapter, and how easily it may be held in mind. Of course no one will fail to note that what is done with the chapters in this study may be done with any other portions of the Bible; and you have doubtless been applying it in your reading and study elsewhere. Of course the Epistles and some chapters of instruction in the Gospels are more difficult of analysis than simple narrative. Yet a little observation and close thought will enable you to recall at will the location of many things in the Bible with which you are familiar in a general way, but the benefit of which you have largely lost because you could not tell where they are, or turn to them without the aid of a concordance.

16. What did He say to the buyers and sellers?
17. What did He continue doing in the temple?
18. What did the chief priests and others seek to do?

### NOTES

1. It would be a good thing to take a few moments of the class time in an outline review of the lessons of the quarter. If the lessons have been well studied, it need not take more than five minutes to give the main topics of chapters 12-19. Perhaps someone will give a complete outline of them. One pupil may be asked to give the subject or subjects of one chapter, and another of another. A good drill, also, will be to take up the chapters promiscuously, going backwards and forwards; or a certain event or parable may be named and the pupils asked to tell where it is found. But do not let this exercise, necessary as it is, draw the mind away from the important lesson under consideration. The student may give himself this test at home.

2. "I tell you if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out." Why would this be?â€”Because long before this thing had been foretold in prophecy. See Zech. 9:9. God's word cannot fail. If men will not act the part assigned them, the very stones will do their work. God's word is so full of life that it can animate the stones. Compare Matt. 3:9.
