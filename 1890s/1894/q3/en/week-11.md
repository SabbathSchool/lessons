### NOTES

1. "It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." This expression implies absolute impossibility, and so it was understood by the disciples, who said, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus said that the thing that is impossible with men is possible with God. The rich man who submits to the Lord will cease to be rich in this world's goods, but will become rich in faith, and then he may enter in. But it is as impossible for a man to enter into the kingdom of God as a rich man, as it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. The Babylonian Jews, using the same proverb, which was a very common one to denote impossibility, have "elephant" instead of "camel." Many attempts have been made to strip the words of Christ of all force by saying that He had reference to a certain gate in Jerusalem called "the needle's eye," which was so small that in order for a camel to pass through he had to have his load stripped from him and then get down and crawl through on his knees. This is pure fancy of the most absurd kind. The term "needle's eye" applied to small gates is a modern one, which has originated from the attempt to destroy the force of this verse. There is no trace of any such name in ancient times.

2. In the case of the twelve we see an instance of the effect that preconceived opinions, without foundation, have on one's reception of truth. So firmly fixed in the minds of the disciples was the idea that Jesus was going to be a temporal ruler, and that His kingdom was to be of the nature of earthly governments, that what He told them about His death and resurrection had no effect on their minds. It was as though He had said nothing. Yet, if they had been diligent students of the prophecies, they might have understood His words, and thus have been prepared for the event. For all the prophets foretold the sufferings of Christ that should precede the glory. 1 Peter 1:10, 11.

3. The healing of the blind man should not be passed lightly by as an ordinary story. It was not given merely to excite our wonder, but to cause us to trust in God. Note the readiness with which Jesus received him and healed him. This was the mercy of the Lord. Note that it was the faith of the blind man that brought him his sight. He was poor, a beggar. He could do nothing for himself. But he could call upon the Lord and plead His mercy. That brought him sight. We are in the same plight that he was. We are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked." Rev. 3:17. If we come to the Lord Jesus as the blind man did, we shall receive our sight as readily as he did. This miracle was recorded for no other purpose than to show how spiritual sight and riches are to be obtained.

"Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;  
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,  
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,  
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

"Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,  
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,  
Because Thy promise I believe;  
O Lamb of God, I come, I come."
