### NOTES

1. Such trust as the Lord teaches in this chapter is not very common. Many who have much to say against spiritualizing Scripture are very loath to take this literally. It is easy to think that we are trusting the Lord when everything is abundant; but real trust is shown by not becoming worried and alarmed when the supply seems exhausted. It is impossible that a Christian should worry about food and clothing; for the eternal life is of more consequence than mere physical life; and he who really trusts God for that which is greatest, can easily trust Him for that which is least. On "growing as the lily," see Hosea 14:5. See also Isa. 61:11. To be full of anxious care is a sign of heathenism, but not of Christianity. See Luke 12:30.

2. "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." God delights to bestow blessings on men. "He delighteth in mercy." Micah 7:18. He gave Himself for us in the gift of Christ, who "ever liveth to make intercession for us." Therefore it is true that God lives for the purpose of bestowing the blessings of His kingdom upon us. Let us then receive it as freely as it is given, and thus add to the joy of the Lord.
