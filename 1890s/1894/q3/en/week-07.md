### NOTES

1. "This man receiveth sinners." That which the Pharisees uttered as a reproach against Jesus, is His greatest glory. It is a glory to Him, and He glories in it. He is not ashamed to receive sinners. "He is not ashamed to call them brethren." Heb. 2:11. "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." He receives us when we offer ourselves to Him as servants, and makes us sons. "Henceforth I call you not servants; ... but I have called you friends." John 15:15. "Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ." Gal. 4:7.

2. "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth." If you are not very watchful, you will find yourself reading according to the common way, "There is joy among the angels over one sinner that repenteth." This is doubtless true, but it is not what the text says. "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God." This includes the other thought, and adds infinitely more to it. God Himself is not ashamed to exhibit in the presence of the angels His great joy over one repentant sinner. What more could be said to encourage poor wanderers? It is not that God will not cast off the repentant one, but that He is overflowing with joy at his return. He cannot and does not attempt to conceal His great joy when even one sinner repents. He watches for him and rushes to meet him when he is yet a long way off.

"For the love of God is broader  
Than the measure of man's mind;  
And the heart of the Eternal  
Is most wonderfully kind."

3. In studying the parable of the prodigal son, do not lose the preciousness of it by allowing your mind to run off into speculation as to who are indicated by the two sons. Whoever you are, the parable means you. Granted that the hard elder brother represents the position of the Pharisees toward the publicans and the Gentiles, we must still remember that the race of Pharisees is not yet extinct. We are either the prodigal son returning to the Father's house, or else we are the carping elder brother. And the worst of the second case is that we are actually in as hard circumstances as the prodigal, and unconscious of it. See Rev. 3:17. Let us be content in studying this chapter to feast upon the revelation of the wonderful love of God, that we may be the more closely drawn to Him. Let this word concerning Christ be ever in our minds, "This Man receiveth sinners."
