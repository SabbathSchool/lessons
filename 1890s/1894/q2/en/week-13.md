# LESSON 26 - June 30, 1894

## FALSE PROFESSION REPROVED
### Luke 11:37-54

The principle of these lessons being that of continual review, it is not necessary to say anything special for the close of the quarter. Remember that you are not studying for examination, nor to make a good showing in class, but for the purpose of becoming acquainted with God's word, and thereby with God Himself. With this object in view you will at all times do the most faithful work possible.

The subject of this lesson is well outlined by the title. If this portion of Scripture is well learned, it will afford a key to a great deal of the Bible.

1. As Jesus was teaching, who asked Him to dinner?
2. What caused the Pharisee to marvel?
3. What did Jesus say of the Pharisees?
4. What about that which is without and that which is within?
5. Then if the inside be unclean, what about the whole?
6. For what did Jesus pronounce a woe upon the Pharisees?
7. Is it wrong, or is it right, to pay tithes?
8. Then where was their sin?
9. For what course in public places did Jesus reprove the Pharisees?
10. To what did He liken them?
11. What did one of the lawyers say of Christ's talk to the Pharisees?

13. What did He say they built?
14. What did they thereby show?
15. What did Jesus say they would do to the apostles and prophets?
16. What would they thereby bring on themselves?
17. With what do those who have a bitter, persecuting spirit identify themselves?
18. What did Jesus say that the lawyers had taken away?
19. How had they dealt with those who would learn?
20. As Jesus said these things, what did the scribes and Pharisees begin to do?
21. Why did they do this?

### NOTES

1. "Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." 1 Sam. 16:7. "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Prov. 23:7. "A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil." Luke 6:45. Out of the heart are the issues of life. Prov. 4:23. What a man appears to be,—that is, what he is outwardly,—is of little consequence; his character is determined by what is within, which men cannot see. "He is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God." Rom. 2:28, 29.

2. "But rather give alms of such things as ye have." The Revised Version has it, "Howbeit give for alms those things which are within." The value of any man's service is determined by what he is. It is the broken and contrite spirit that makes the sacrifice a real one. Everyone must give himself. If Christ dwells within, then every act done is acceptable to God; if Christ is not formed within, the greatest effort, and toil, and pains, are nothing. See Micah 6:6-8.

3. "These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." The demonstrative "these" always applies to the things nearest; "those," to things remote. The Saviour therefore said, Ye ought to do judgment and the love of God; and ye ought not to leave tithing undone. "All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's; it is holy unto the Lord." Lev. 27:30. That is all that need be said about it, except to ask, "Will a man rob God?" Mal. 3:8. We cannot give a tithe to the Lord, for it is His already; but we may rob Him by retaining it. Here is a test as to a man's honesty. The man who gives to every man his due, except to one man, whom he systematically defrauds, cannot be called an honest man. God is greater than man, and to rob Him is a greater sin than to rob man. Yet many men who would spurn the idea that they would rob their fellowmen, will rob God without any compunctions of conscience. Why? Because God does not at once make requisition for that of which He has been defrauded, and they are not found out. Those who, knowing the Scriptures, rob God under such circumstances, thereby show that they would defraud their fellowmen if there were no fear of detection and immediate punishment.

4. "To love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets." Praise and honor from men are bestowed only because of what appears outwardly, for no man can see what is within. Therefore those who love praise will pay attention only to that which is without, and to do that is sin. "How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?" John 5:44.

5. On verses 49-51 see 2 Chron. 24:20-22. Jehoida had done great kindness to Joash. After his death Joash and the princes of Judah conspired to leave the house of the Lord, and serve idols. Zechariah, the son of Jehoida, reproved them for transgressing the commandments of the Lord, and they stoned him to death. Their murdering him was exactly of the same nature as their idolatry, and was the natural result of it. Therefore all who stubbornly transgress the commandments of the Lord have murder in their hearts. The Pharisees and lawyers were rejecting Christ Himself, of whom all the prophets testified, and who was greater than all of them together. Therefore in rejecting Him the blood of all the martyrs came upon them. But the same thing is true of all who reject the teaching of Christ, even though He is not visibly present.

6. The Pharisees dogged the steps of Christ continually, to find some cause of accusation against Him. On this occasion they began to overwhelm Him with questions of the most exasperating nature, in hopes of provoking Him to a hasty retort. But nothing of the kind could they get from His lips. The servant of Christ will often be placed in similar circumstances. Unreasonable and wicked men, who have not faith, will ask questions, not sincerely, but as a trap. There is where he will need the greatest wisdom. Sometimes it may be best, although it will cost the greatest effort, to make no reply. "I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, even from good." Ps. 39:1, 2. In all cases he will require more than human wisdom. Indeed, since no one but Christ has ever given a perfectly discreet answer to every question, it is evident that He alone can do it. Therefore the servants of Christ are warranted in expecting, not only when before governors and kings, but at all times, the fulfillment of the words, "It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." Matt. 10:20.
