# LESSON 25 - June 23, 1894

## THE POWER OF CHRIST
### Luke 11:14-36

In this lesson verses 14-26 relate to the casting out of a dumb demon, the blasphemous charge of the Pharisees, and Christ's rebuke to them, showing the inconsistency of their assertion that He cast out devils through the prince of devils. The remainder of the lesson pertains chiefly to signs. A rebuke is given to those who look for signs instead of depending on the word of God; and the necessity of having light in one's self, through the word, is emphasized.

8. When does he lose them?

18. To whose word did the queen of Sheba listen?
19. Whose preaching convinced the Ninevites?
20. Why would their action condemn the men to whom Jesus was speaking?
21. Will the same thing apply in these days?

25. To what are we to take heed?
26. What will be the condition if the whole body be full of light?

### NOTES

1. "Others, tempting Him, sought of Him a sign from heaven." This was the same temptation that had been met in the wilderness. The devil was still trying to get Him to do something for the express purpose of silencing unbelief, without any reference to the benefit of men. All Christ's works were works of mercy. He performed them naturally, as the opportunity and necessity for them arose in His daily life. But He never did anything in answer to a challenge. If the regular work of the ministry of the gospel will not convince men, they will not be convinced by a mere exhibition of knowledge or skill, in answer to a challenge.

2. Jesus had just done a wonderful work, in casting out a devil, and still they asked for a sign. What greater thing could He have done before them? They would not believe though He cast out a legion of devils. The gospel itself is a miracle. Satan works in every natural or unconverted man. Eph. 2:1, 2. Therefore when a man is converted and exhibits the fruits of righteousness instead of the works of the flesh, that is an instance of the casting out of the evil spirit by the Spirit of God. Therefore it is that the godly lives of Christians are the best testimonies to the power of the gospel. See Isa. 43:10; John 17:21-23.

3. The fact that Christ cast out devils was proof enough that He was from God; for Satan would not seek to destroy his own kingdom. Christ came upon Satan and took from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divided his spoils. "And having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it," that is, in His cross, or in Himself. Col. 2:15. All power in heaven and in earth is given to Christ, therefore Satan has no power at all in a contest with Him. These demonstrations of Christ's power over evil spirits were recorded for our encouragement in our conflict with evil. He has overcome the world; therefore our faith in Him is the victory that overcometh the world.

4. "He that is not with Me is against Me." There is no middle ground; everyone that has not the Spirit of Christ has the spirit of Satan. Christ must be "all in all."

5. Christ is able to cast out the unclean spirit, but only His continued presence can keep it out. "He that is not with Me is against Me." If, when the heart has been cleansed, it is not intrusted fully to the care of the Lord, the evil spirit will return, and then the man will be worse than before. A backslider or an apostate is worse than one who has never known the Lord.
