# LESSON 20 - May 19, 1894

## THE BREAD OF LIFE
### Luke 9:7-27

This lesson may be sufficiently outlined as follows: Herod's perplexity; the return of the twelve; the feeding of the five thousand; opinions concerning Jesus; instruction to His followers. Again the caution must be repeated to the student not to study the synopsis from the lesson pamphlet, but directly from the Bible. In every lesson use the pamphlet at first only for the purpose of noting the portion of Scripture forming the lesson. Then read the verses very carefully several times, and make your own synopsis. Note down on a slip of paper the different topics, and then compare with the list in the pamphlet. Bear in mind that the Bible, and not the pamphlet, is to be studied. The pamphlet is designed only to direct your study, so that you may study to the best advantage.

### NOTES

1. "And he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing." There is one thing that always recommends one to the kind attention of Jesus, and that is to be in need. And yet that feeling of need and general worthlessness is what keeps many away from Him. There were no exceptions, no special favorites. No matter who they were, nor how many there were, He healed them that had need of healing. Thus it came to pass that "there were whole villages where there were no sick ones, for He had healed them all." He is the same today that he was then. What he did then He is just as able and willing to do now.

"All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him."

2. Five thousand men were fed with five loaves and two fishes, and not only did they all eat, but they were all filled. Imagine how much it would take to fill to satisfaction a crowd of five thousand hungry men, besides women and children. And then think of the small portion available for them. There was not enough for each one to have a mouthful. If they had divided it equally among themselves, there would have been scarcely enough for anyone to have even the taste of food. And then, most wonderful to relate, there was much more left, after all had been satisfied, than there was when they began to eat. What more striking illustration could be given of the statement that He "is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think? Eph. 3:20.

3. The question is, Where did that bread come from? The original amount, instead of being diminished, was increased. There can be only one answer: It came from the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He is the Bread of Life. John 6:48-51. In this miracle we are again shown how that believing on Him we may have life through His name. For just as He had power in Himself to supply the physical needs of that multitude, so He has power to supply all our spiritual wants. And just as surely as the multitude could eat that bread which came from Him, and be nourished by it, so we may really feed upon Christ, and grow thereby.

4. It seems incredible that anyone who really believes this miracle should ever have a doubt of Christ's power to save us by His own life in us. The general objection is that it seems so unreal, so intangible, that we cannot understand how Christ's life can come into us to make us strong to do His will. Well, here we have the thing made as simple as the supply of daily bread for our physical strength. Let us go to the very beginning of the matter. There is nobody who has any doubt that the food which we eat day by day gives us strength. We become faint and ready to die through long fasting; we eat good food, and our strength and life come again. That food becomes part of our blood, and the strength and the life which we feel renewed in us are the strength and the life that were in the food that we ate. And yet, as we look at the bread, we can see no life in it, and it does not look at at all like flesh and blood. If we had not been used to receiving strength all our lives through eating food,—if we had been miraculously kept alive till manhood without food,—and at the age of twenty-one were told that our life in the future depended on our eating bread, the majority of people would starve to death. Very few would believe that any life could come from such a source. Scientists would be ready to demonstrate the impossibility of forming flesh and blood out of bread. It is a merciful provision of God for the preservation of the race that people learn to sustain life by eating, long before they are able to reason about it. When the plant is growing, we see evidences of life in it, although we cannot see the life. We see immense energy displayed by it. We see huge clods of earth pushed aside by it, and even stones are sometimes rent asunder by it. Whence come this life and power? Through God's word, which said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth." Gen. 1:11. The energy displayed in the growing plant is nothing less than the power of God. That same life is stored up in the seed, which forms the food of man; so that our physical food comes as truly from the Lord as did the bread which the five thousand ate. In that case the process of bread making was shortened. Now just as God fills the plant with life, of which we partake for the nourishment of our bodies, so He fills us with His own life of righteousness, if by faith we receive Him through His word. We cannot understand how any of it is done; but it is no more difficult to believe that God can work perfection in a man than that He can do it in a plant.

5. The people could not feed themselves; they could not derive any strength from themselves. They, as we and all others are, were entirely dependent for strength on the food which they ate. Moreover, they could not do anything to assist the food to give them strength. All that they could do was to eat it as it was provided for them, and then leave it alone. Why can we not learn the lesson which God designs us to learn from our daily food? Whether we realize it or not, we depend absolutely on Christ for our life, through the food which He provides us. So we must depend solely on Christ for our righteousness which is real life. If our faith grasps the reality of this miracle,—a miracle that is repeated every day,—then it can grasp the fact that He can put His life directly into us; and having that, we have all. His life fills and satisfies the hungry soul.

6. The gospel is God's plan, and not man's. Man's only plan for receiving anything is to seize upon it. "Each one for himself," is the motto of the world. But Christ says that whosoever wishes to live must give up his life, and that whoever seeks to save his own life, shall lose it. The world's motto is derived from Satan. He had a glorious position. But he wanted more, and set about to seize it, and as a consequence he lost everything. Christ had everything, but He willingly gave up all. He did not grasp and hold even His own, and as a result He gained everything. Read Phil. 2:5-9. "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich." 2 Cor. 8:9.
