See John 17:6, 11, 26. The two wonderful victories combined were never before known by any company; hence, no others could sing the song, because they have never had the experience.

## NOTE

THE company of Rev. 14:12 are the last remnant church existing upon the earth when the Lord comes. See verse 14; chap. 22:17. The company of Rev. 14:1-5 are those who are taken to heaven at Jesus' coming, from among the living. They are before the throne in heaven (verse 1); they are redeemed from the earth (verse 3), and "redeemed," not from the grave, but "from among men" (verse 4).
