# LESSON 11—March 14, 1896

## THE IMAGE AND MARK

REVIEW QUESTIONS.—(a) What does the beast represent? (b) What is the Papacy? (c) What is represented by the two-horned beast? (d) What is its character, and how represented? (e) What would it deceive the people into doing?

1. What is an image to the beast?

Ans.—A union of church and state, by which the church will use the state to accomplish its own objects.

2. What have we already seen accomplished in this direction?

Ans.—The churches in various ways have brought pressure to bear upon the government until the government has committed itself in its several departments to the principle of religious legislation. See note 1.

3. What further step may be taken by the Federal Government?

Ans.—The next logical step of the government would be to change the organic law so that it would conform to the decision of the Supreme Court, though all this may be accomplished irregularly by some construction of the Supreme Court. Man does not know what phase the movement will take.

4. When governments legislate on the things of God, what are logically considered the highest laws and the most heinous crimes? Ans.—The laws relating to man's duty to God and their violation.

5. With what is the violation of the highest laws generally punished? Ans.—With death. See note 2.

6. What part of the prophecy would be thus easily fulfilled? Rev. 13:15.

### THE MARK OF THE BEAST

7. Against what does God warn us besides the beast and his worship? Rev. 14:9.

8. What must the mark of the beast be? Ans.—The badge of his authority, the sign of his power.

9. What does the mark show him who receives it to be?

Ans.—A servant. It was a custom anciently to brand slaves with the mark of their master, as men now brand cattle. The mark showed to whom the slave belonged and whom he served.

10. Of whom would the mark of the beast show men to be worshipers? Rev. 13:8.

11. In worshiping the beast whom would we serve?

Ans.—To worship the beast is to serve him instead of God. The real essence of worship is service. Matt. 4:10.

12. What would therefore mark the difference between the worshipers of the beast and the worshipers of God? Ans.—The difference in the service rendered.

13. What would regulate the conduct of the two classes of servants? Ans.—The law and spirit of their respective earthly governments.

14. What is the rule of God's government? Eccl. 12:13.

15. What have we found to be the sign, mark, or badge of His power? Ans.—The Sabbath.

16. What would therefore be the mark or badge of the rival worship, the worship of the beast? Ans.—The rival sabbath, or that part of the law of the beast which differs from God's law.

17. What change has the prophet declared this apostate power would make in God's law? Dan. 7:25, R. V.: "The times and the law." Spurrel: "The appointed times and the law," referring directly to that part of the law relating to God's appointed times, the day and the week, the crown of which is the Sabbath.

18. How would this power thus exalt itself? 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.

19. What does the Papacy claim as the mark of its power?

Ans.—"Q.--How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?

"A.—By the very act of changing Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants themselves allow of...

"By keeping Sunday they [Protestants] acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin."—Abridgment of Christian Doctrine. See "The Lord's Day," pp. 83 to 85, for other testimony. See also note 3.

20. What is there to show that the churches of this country are using the civil power to enforce the mark of the beast?

Ans.—Almost every effort thus far made to unite church and state in this country has had for its center the sabbath question, and has had Sunday legislation or establishment as its object.

21. What, therefore, in the light of the prophecy, is the mark of the beast? Ans.—Sunday enforced by civil law. See note 4.

22. Under what penalty will it be enforced? Rev. 13:15, 16.

23. What solemn warning has God given concerning it? Rev. 14:9-11.

## NOTES

1. NOTE the movements and events which have led up, and contributed to, the present state of things:—

(a) The National Reform Association, which has been working for a union of church and state ever since 1863. The literature and lectures of this organization have leavened the minds of men in all the various denominations.

(b) The adoption of the same principles by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in 1886.

(c) The Prohibition party committed to the same in 1887.

(d) The American Sabbath Union, organized in 1888, one object of which is to obtain and secure the enforcement of religious legislation.

(e) The Trinity Church decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, February 29, 1892, declared that "this is a Christian nation." See "Rights of the People," part 2, chapter 6.

(f) The decision by both houses of Congress in the same year of a religious controversy, the Sabbath question, and the endorsement of the same by the President, thus committing the legislative and executive branches to religious legislation.

(g) The enforcement of religious laws in various states, thus bringing persecution upon men for conscience' sake. The fulfillment of the prophecy of Revelation 13 is no longer a matter of prophecy; it is fulfilling before our eyes. The old political parties are indorsing Sunday laws to either save or win votes. See New York in 1895. See "Rights of the People," chap. 9.

2. RELIGIOUS persecution, if pursued to the extreme, either ends in the yielding of the heretic or the death penalty. Gibbon well says: "It is incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it to the last extreme. They excite the flame which they try to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy as well as the crime of the offender. The fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge exposes his person to the severity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of capital punishment."—Decline and Fall of Roman Empire, chap. 37, par. 23, part 5.

"The right to use force implies the right to take the life of those who make resistance."—Young's Class-book on Civil Government, p. 267.

3. MANY sincere Christians have died observing Sunday as the Sabbath. It was in their heart and will to do God's pleasure, and He accepted them. There are many observing it in ignorance to-day. It is when men reject light from God's word that they are condemned; but it is not for man or men to say when that time is reached. The judgment belongs to God. It is the duty of the Christian to preach the word.

4. THE reception of the mark in the forehead would indicate full assent to the iniquitous assumptions of the beast; receiving it in the hand would indicate assent to its demand through some other motive than that of belief.
