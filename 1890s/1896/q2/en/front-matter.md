"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." Deut. 6:6, 7.

## PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS

**SABBATH.** — (After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, recalling Scripture words and references. Read the lesson for the intermediate division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.

**SUNDAY.** — Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:

1. Assign a reference to each member of the family, using the lesson pamphlet to ascertain what references are used in the lesson.
2. Then read the texts in their regular order, carefully considering what each one says before reading the next one. Be sure to have each member of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each text.
3. Select two texts to be committed to memory through the day.
4. Repeat the memory verse.

**MONDAY.** — Review the portion of the lesson already studied.

1. Have each one name as many references as he can.
2. Give each one an opportunity to repeat the two texts that were to be committed to memory on the previous day.
3. Assign each one a text found in the first half of the lesson, and let one member of the family ask the questions from the lesson pamphlet, and the others in turn read the answers given in the texts or in the LESSON QUARTERLY.

Then study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the first half was studied on Sunday.

**TUESDAY.** — Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and ask the questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand the questions and the meaning of the words used in them.

Select two texts to be committed to memory during the day.

**WEDNESDAY.** — Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and review the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY, the Instructor, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. The number and age of the children would usually indicate which lesson help would be the best.

**THURSDAY.** — Read the lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in the Sabbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and review the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the LESSON QUARTERLY. Repeat the texts committed to memory.

**FRIDAY.** — Thoroughly review the entire lesson in the following manner:

1. Ask the questions as found in the LESSON QUARTERLY.
2. Call upon different ones to give a synopsis of the lesson or the lesson story in their own language.
3. Have the references given by different ones, and have those texts repeated that have been committed to memory.
4. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson.

**SABBATH.** — Review practical truths of the lesson, repeat all the texts committed to memory, and relate personal experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been found helpful.

(This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of thorough, regular, systematic study of the Scriptures as given in our Sabbath school lessons.)

Our Sabbath School Contributions this Quarter are for Mission Work in the Southern States.

# LESSONS ON THE LIFE IN CHRIST AND THE SAINTS' INHERITANCE

For Senior Classes  
Second Quarter, 1896

## INTRODUCTION

The subjects under consideration in these lessons can only be briefly treated in one quarter. The aim has been to use only leading texts that will guide the teacher and student in the investigation of these interesting subjects. It is left for the teachers and students to study them as far as their time will permit.

Do not be afraid of wasting time in reviewing. Go over and over each text until both the words and the thought of the text are fastened in the mind.
