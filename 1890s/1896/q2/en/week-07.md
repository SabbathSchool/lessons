### NOTES

1. The word "resurrection" is defined as follows: "A rising again from the dead: a return from death to life."— The Standard. The Greek word anastasis is defined as "a standing up, rising up, as from the dead."—Bruinger.

2. The expressions, "first fruits," "firstborn," and "first begotten," when applied to Christ, must denote the preeminent rank and station which He holds in the great work of redemption, rather than in the order of time in which His resurrection occurred. We read of several resurrected ones who were raised before Christ was raised. See 1 Kings 17; 2 Kings 4; Luke 7:14; 8:40, 55; John 11:11-26. It would be doing violence to the scriptures to attempt to dispose of these by saying they were raised to mortality only, for all the wicked are thus raised, and spoken of as being resurrected. See John 5:29; Acts 24:15. All these resurrections center in Christ, who is the resurrection and the life. He stands out foremost and preeminent in all these instances, whether occurring before or after His resurrection. In this sense He is the "first fruits" of those that slept. He is the chief one, for the raising of all the others depended upon His power.

3. The transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-5) was a miniature representation of the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. See chapter 16:28. Here Christ appeared in kingly majesty (2 Peter 1:16, 17), and Elijah as a representative of those that shall be changed in a moment without seeing death, and Moses, who had died, but was resurrected. See Jude 9. Christ's kingdom is to be in connection with His coming (2 Tim. 4:1), and that is the time when all the righteous dead are raised, and the living righteous will be changed. It is the same power that gives immortality to the living that raises the dead. So it is giving immortality to both the living and the dead who have had the abiding Christ within.
