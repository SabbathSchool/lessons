### NOTES

1. A more literal reading of 1 Cor. 15:18 would be, "They which have fallen asleep in Christ have gone to nothing." Paul follows the above with these words: "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable." In his reasoning, he regards the body of the first Adam as being the man, and that without redemption man would certainly go to nothing at death. As water, when the hydrogen and oxygen are separated, ceases to be water, so, when the elements that made man are separated, man ceases to exist.

2. One of the marked characteristics of sleep is unconsciousness. An individual may feel a sense of drowsiness and yet realize what is going on around him, but we do not say that he is asleep until he is lost to all that is around him. Sight, smell, hearing, and touch fail, and all voluntary motion ceases. This is sleep, a profound unconsciousness. The Saviour, who knew its nature full well, in the case of Lazarus used it to express the condition of man in death. John 11:11.

3. In unconsciousness there is no account of time. This has been illustrated many times in case of accident. Persons receiving a stroke upon the head have been unconscious for several days. If they have received the blow while speaking, the sentence is broken off till consciousness is restored, when they finish the sentence, having no knowledge of the intervening time. So in death, there may be a long time from death to the resurrection, but to the dead it is nothing. One moment it is losing consciousness, while the next it is awakened by the voice of Jesus Christ.

4. Satan is the author of sin (1 John 3:8), and death came by sin (Rom. 5:12); therefore all the power of Satan is in death. Sin is disorganizing and destructive, not merely of happiness, but of life itself. James 1:14, 15.
