# SELF-PRONOUNCING TEACHERS' BIBLES.

We have not room to go into details in describing the helps in this valuable edition, but after carefully examining them we feel confident that they contain a vast amount of information which will interest and profit the Bible student. They are all carefully prepared by eminent authors, such as Rev. John H. Vincent, LL.D.; Rev. Philip Schaff, D. D., LL.D.; Rev. James Stalker, D. D., and others, and combines the best scholarly research with the greatest possible brevity.

A new feature of this edition is what is termed a "WORD BOOK." It combines a Concordance, Index, Dictionary of Proper Names, Gazetteer, etc. This will especially recommend itself to the student desiring something for ready reference.

## ILLUSTRATIONS.

These illustrations have been carefully selected, and cover all necessary subjects. They are frequently referred to by the Authors in the body of the Helps, and the pictures themselves refer to the articles which they illustrate.

## SELF-PRONOUNCING TEXT.

All proper names are so marked and accented that no one need have any difficulty in pronouncing even the longest and hardest.

## PRICES.

As you will see, the prices on these NEW BIBLES are extremely low, and we are sure many will avail themselves of this opportunity to secure a SELF-PRONOUNCING TEACHERS' BIBLE.
