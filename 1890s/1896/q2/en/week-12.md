### NOTES

1. Bishop Horsley translates 2 Sam. 7:19 as follows: "O Lord God, Thou hast spoken of Thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me in the arrangements about the Man that is to be from above, O God Jehovah," or, as some translate, "The Adam from above, God Jehovah."

2. The name "David," as used in these scriptures, evidently alludes to Christ; for David had been dead for centuries when these promises were made. On the day of Pentecost, Peter says of David: "He is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne." Acts 2:29, 30. This shows that where a future reign of David is promised in prophecy, it refers to the reign of Christ on the throne of His father David. See Ps. 89:20-21, 27-29; 132:11, 12; Luke 1:32, 33.
