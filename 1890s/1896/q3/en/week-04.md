### NOTES

1. IT was but natural that the mother of Jesus should be at this gathering; for "the parties were relatives of Joseph and Mary. The special object of Jesus in attending this marriage feast was to commence the work of breaking down the exclusiveness which existed with the Jewish people, and to open the way for their freer mingling with the people. He had come not only as the Messiah of the Jews, but the Redeemer of the world. By attending this feast, Jesus sanctioned marriage as a divine institution, and through all His subsequent ministry, He paid the marriage covenant a marked respect in illustrating many important truths by it. While no shadow of worldly levity marred His conduct, He had sanctioned the social gathering with His presence. He gave no license to scenes of dissipation and revelry, yet innocent happiness was pleasing to Him."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, chapter 7.

2. THE marriage relation was instituted before the fall (Gen. 2:18, 24), and, using it as an illustration of His union with His church (Eph. 5:23, 25, 29-32), Christ, through the word, has taught precious lessons. It is a striking fact that the Sabbath and marriage, the two institutions which were established during man's innocency, are now the special objects of Satan's attack. Men are now declaring that both are a yoke of bondage, interfering with their liberty. True liberty is only found in being in harmony with God (Ps. 119:45), and is not an excuse for sin (1 Peter 2:16).

3. THERE was no coldness or disrespect in Christ's form of address to His mother. He used the same form of address in His last words to her. Chapter 19:26.

4. "THIS donation of Christ to the marriage supper was a symbol of the means of salvation. The water represented baptism into His death; the wine, the shedding of His blood for the purifying of the sins of the world. The provision made for the wedding guests was ample, and not less abundant is the provision for blotting out the iniquities of men. The wine which Christ provided was not of an intoxicating character."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, p. 101. "In the words, 'Destroy this temple,' Christ gives a sign that He reads the secrets of their souls. These words of Christ possessed a double meaning, referring to the temple at Jerusalem as well as to His own material body (the earthly temple of the Son of God)... When the Jews should put Christ to death, they would virtually destroy the temple... As the death of Christ brought to an end the sacrificial system, and destroyed the sacredness of the earthly temple, so the resurrection of Christ involved the opening of the true ministration in the sanctuary above, the temple of God in heaven."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. CAN you see in this miracle any teaching that ceremonials must have in them life and power from Christ to be of any value?

2. See how God's power to create us, to cleanse us, and to raise us from the dead, are all taught in this lesson.

3. Observe the new places mentioned.
