### NOTES

1. "THE mind is an invisible agent of God to produce tangible results. Its influence is powerful, and governs the actions of men. If purified from all evil, it is the motive power of good. The regenerating Spirit of God, taking possession of the mind, transforms the life; wicked thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced, love, peace, and humility take the place of anger, envy, and strife. That power which no human eye can see, has created a new being in the image of God... The power of the Holy Spirit transforms the entire man. This change constitutes the new birth... Human nature is vile, and man's character must be changed before it can harmonize with the pure and holy in God's immortal kingdom. This transformation is the new birth." "Not even a respectable life, and a respectable religiousness besides, — this is not to be reborn; this is but to be mended, patched." There must be "the communication of life by the Spirit of God."

2. THE "must" of verse 7 finds its complement in the "must" of verse 14. God "must" make provision for whatever "must" be done in us.

3. "YOU have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and ask that He will wash away your sins, and give you a new heart. Then believe that He does this, because He has promised. Through this simple act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has begotten a new life in your heart. You are as a child born into the family of God, and He loves you as He loves His Son."—Steps to Christ, pp. 51, 52.

4. POSITION does not necessarily imply a fitness for the work. One may be "the teacher of Israel" (R. V.) and yet not know "these things."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. NICODEMUS said, "We know," but Christ said, "I say unto thee." What is the force of this change from the plural to the singular?

2. Two teachers are mentioned, — "a teacher come from God," and "the teacher of Israel" (R. V.). Note the difference between them.

3. The "life" of chapter 1:4 is now spoken of as "eternal life." This is one of the key-words of this Gospel. We shall have occasion to study it carefully.
