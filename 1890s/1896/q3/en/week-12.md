### NOTES

1. HIS rejection by the Jews is still the theme of Christ's discourse with them, and He shows them that, although they pride themselves upon their study of the Scriptures, through their knowledge of which they expect to have salvation, yet they reject that very word when it is made flesh, and are "not willing" to come to Him who is the Life both of the Scriptures and the believer. "The whole Bible tells of Christ. From the first record of creation... to the closing promise, 'Behold, I come quickly,' we are reading of His works and listening to His voice. If you would become acquainted with the Saviour, study the Holy Scriptures."

2. "THE Scriptures are unfolded, not so much to the intellect, as to the heart, of man... The Bible is a sealed book, so far as its spiritual treasures are concerned, to the man who brings only his intellect to the study of it... The intellect is but the handmaid to the heart in Bible study... The Bible is a book addressed to the heart rather than to the head... Men generally do not understand the Bible, because they seek to understand it with their heads, rather than with their hearts. The word of God is to be heard with our ears or seen with our eyes, but it is to be understood with our hearts."

3. "JESUS came by the authority of God, bearing His image, fulfilling His word, and seeking His glory; yet the leaders in Israel did not recognize or accept Him; but when others should come assuming the character of Christ, but actuated only by their own will, seeking their own glory, they would be received. And why? Because the teachings of these pretenders were in harmony with the traditions and prejudices of the Jews. The Jewish leaders were destitute of the love of God; and while their hearts were filled with envy, prejudice, and self-righteousness, they could not distinguish the voice of God. They were not acquainted with God. To them His voice through Jesus Christ was the voice of a stranger. Does not the same danger still exist? Are there not still those, it may be even religious leaders, who, by indulging pride, self-righteousness, or prejudice, are hardening their hearts against the influence of God's Holy Spirit, and making it impossible for them to discern His voice? It is thus that many reject the messages of truth that God sends to them."

4. IT is "a desert place" (Mark 6:32); but this is simply the country as opposed to the city, an uninhabited place, and so there was "much grass" there. Philip's liberal expenditure of money would only provide "a little" for each one, but Christ's blessing upon, and ministry of, the little which they had, made it possible for all to be "filled." A little of this world's goods, with Christ, is better than all that the money of the world can buy, without Christ.

5. THE instruction in verse 12 is of general application. "Every gift of God is to be made the most of. Fragments of time, money, opportunity, influence, are not to be flung away, but used."

6. THIS lesson brings out the truth that Christ is the Sustainer of spiritual life, as well as the Giver of it, and He would teach that He sustains this life by imparting Himself. The full import of this miracle is set forth by Christ Himself in his discourse upon the bread of life, which will be studied in later lessons.

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. CHRIST said to the Jews, "Ye have not His word abiding in you," and, "Ye have not the love of God in you." How are the "word" and the "love" manifested in those who possess them?

2. GOD put His own name in Christ from the first (Heb. 1:8; Ex. 23:21; Isa. 9:6, etc.), and Christ "was manifested to take away our sins" (1 John 3:5), by manifesting that name (John 17:6) without which there is no salvation (Acts 4:12). That name written in our foreheads (Rev. 14:1) is a sign of the completed work. It is a fulfilment of the new covenant promise (Heb. 8:10).

3. Verse 44 brings out the lesson of "self-seeking a hindrance to faith."

4. Were any delicacies, merely to please or to tempt the appetite, provided in this meal?

5. Compare the effect of this miracle upon the people with its effect upon the rulers.
