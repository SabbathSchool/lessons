### NOTES

1. THE object of writing the Gospel is twofold: to furnish ground for confidence that there was the incarnation of the divine nature in the person of Christ (that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, chapter 20:31), and that this incarnation has for its object to give eternal life to mankind (that believing ye might have life through His name, lb.). Life in Christ only, and life through Christ only, are leading thoughts in this Gospel, and they are suggested in this introduction (of verses 4 and 12).

2. THE true Light has an influence upon all men. "Whenever they make an effort to reform, from a sincere desire to do right, it is the power of Christ that is drawing them... The sinner may resist this love, may refuse to be drawn to Christ; but if he does not resist, he will be drawn to Jesus." Verse 11 is also, and properly, rendered, "Unto His own possessions He came, and His own people did not receive Him home."—Rotherham. They who "receive Him" are they "that believe on His name." To receive Him is to believe on His name. It is ours to receive Him (Col. 2:6), and His to bestow the "power" ("right or privilege," margin). Christ took our nature by birth (Gal. 4:4), that we might take His nature (2 Peter 1:4) by birth (1 Peter 1:23).

3. "HE clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might touch humanity; that His personal presence might be among us; that we might know that He is acquainted with all our trials, and sympathizes with our griefs; that every son and daughter of Adam might understand that Jesus is the friend of sinners. He set up His tabernacle (see Revised Version, margin of verse 14) in the midst of our human encampment; He pitched His tent by the side of the tents of men, that He might dwell among us, and make us familiar with His divine character and life." Thus was He true to His name, Immanuel. Matt. 1:23.

4. "DIVINITY needed humanity; for it required both the divine and the human to bring salvation to the world. Divinity needed humanity, that humanity might afford a channel of communication between God and man. So with the servants and messengers of Christ. Man needs a power outside of and beyond himself, to restore him to the likeness of God; but this does not make the human agency unessential. Humanity lays hold upon the divine power; Christ dwells in the heart by faith; and through cooperation with the divine, the power of man becomes efficient for good."

5. CHRIST was a visible manifestation to the world of the glory of the Invisible One (Col. 1:15), and this thought runs through this Gospel (chapters 2:11; 7:18; 11:40; 17:22). The fifteenth verse may be regarded as a parenthesis, and the last clause may be rendered, "He who after me was coming, before me has advanced; because He was my Chief."—Rotherham.

6. GRACE appropriated becomes "a foundation for the bestowment of more grace;" or grace received becomes "a title and claim to new grace." The law, which is the form of truth (Rom. 2:20), was given by Moses, but the truth itself (that is, the "reality" of the law in life) was in Christ (John 14:6). Christ reveals God (Matt. 11:27), not simply by words, but also by His life. Thus "He declares the invisible God, acts as His interpreter, gives expression to Him, renders Him cognizable to human faculties." Thus is He the Word. He is able to reveal God fully, for "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. COMPARE the first five verses in this lesson with the first chapter of Genesis. Note the three steps in both places: "All things" (inanimate creation), "life" (vegetable and animal creation), "men" (man). Light and life by the Word of God (the Word) in both records. Light in darkness (compare 2 Cor. 4:6).

2. Observe the foundation for the whole question of conditional immortality laid in verse 4.

3. In the seventeenth verse may be found the true relationship between the law and the Gospel, a formal code becoming life and reality in Christ.

4. Note how fully this introduction to the Gospel presents Christ. It teaches the preexistence of Christ (verse 1), creation through Christ (verse 3), John's witness to Christ (verse 7), the advent and rejection of Christ (verse 11), the new birth to become like Christ (verse 13), the incarnation of Christ (verse 14), and the representative character of Christ (verse 18). Seven great facts. Each one might be studied for a day with profit.

5. Two great names are mentioned in this lesson: Moses, a type of Christ, whose prayer was, "Show me now Thy way," and John the Baptist, whose mission it was to "make straight the way." Both were "sent" to do a special work for God.
