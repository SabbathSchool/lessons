### NOTES

1. THE work of John accomplished the right result, â€” his disciples heard him, but they followed Jesus. The great apostasy was caused by men winning disciples to themselves. Acts 20:30.

2. "IN the calling of John and Andrew and Simon, of Philip and Nathanael, the foundation of the Christian church was laid. John directed two of his disciples to Christ. Then one of these, Andrew, finds his brother and brings him to the Saviour. Philip is then called, and he goes in search of Nathanael. These examples should teach us the importance of personal effort, or of making direct appeals to kindred, friends, and neighbors." The testimony which brought both Simon and Nathanael to Jesus was, "We have found" Him. This is the testimony which wins now.

3. "AT the time when Philip called him, Nathanael had withdrawn to a quiet grove to meditate upon the announcement of John, and the prophecies concerning the Messiah. He prayed that if the one announced by John was the deliverer, it might be made known to him; and the Holy Spirit rested upon him with an overwhelming assurance that God had visited His people, and raised up a horn of salvation for them. Philip's message seemed to Nathanael a direct answer to his prayer."

4. "LIKE Nathanael, we need to study God's word for ourselves, and pray for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. He who saw Nathanael under the fig tree, will see us in the secret places of prayer, if we seek Him that we may know what is truth. Angels from the world of light will be near to those who in humility of heart pray for divine guidance." "The tree has never grown which could conceal a soul from the eye of Jesus."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. FOUR new titles for Christ are mentioned in this lesson: Master (better, Teacher, R. V., margin), Messias, King of Israel, Son of man. What different ideas of the work of Christ are set forth in these titles!

2. Jesus "looked upon" Peter twice. Verse 42, R. V., and Luke 22:61. The two looks may be considered with profit.

3. What is the difference between Philip's confession of Christ as "Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph," and Nathanael's statement, "Thou art the Son of God"?

4. Note the new names and the new places introduced in this lesson.

5. See how readily these men recognized Jesus as the Son of God. Is not this the comment of Scripture upon the promise in Matt. 5:8?
