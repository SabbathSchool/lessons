### NOTES

1. THE statement in verse 19, repeated in verse 30, brings before us the position of entire dependence upon the Father which Jesus voluntarily took, in order that He might be our example, when He assumed our nature. "Christ came from heaven to give to the world a correct representation of the Father... The love and justice of God, and also the immutability of His law, are made manifest by the Saviour's life, no less than by His death. He assumed human nature, with its infirmities, its liabilities, its temptations. Matt. 8:17; Heb. 2:17, 14. He exercised in His own behalf no power which we can not exercise. As man, He met temptation and overcame in the strength given Him of God. He gives us an example of perfect obedience... His life testified that by the aid of the same divine power which Christ received, it is possible for man to obey God's law."

2. "FEW realize the full force of Christ's words in regard to His connection with the Father. They teach man that he should consider himself inseparably bound to his heavenly Parent, that whatever position he may occupy, he is responsible to God, who holds all destinies in His hands."

3. THE lesson to Nicodemus, the lesson to the woman of Samaria, the lesson in the healing of the nobleman's son, and the impotent man, are all set forth in verse 21,â€”"life only in Christ."

4. "THEY were to behold greater wonders than the healing of the poor sufferer at Bethesda. They would see the Son of God restoring the dead to life, and this would be a testimony to them of His power to restore to spiritual life those who were dead in trespasses and sins. It was His work, through His teachings, attended by the power of the Holy Spirit, to beget a new life in the souls of men, to make them partakers of the divine nature... This change is no less a miracle of the power of God than is the raising of the dead to life."

5. THE present possession of everlasting life through faith is again taught in verse 24; see also verse 36 of chapter 3. By comparing these two verses we shall see that believing on the Son includes hearing His words (hearkening to them) and believing on the Father. "Faith is but the appropriation of the lost life, offered to us again in Christ."

6. GOD has life "in Himself," Christ has life "in Himself," but apart from God in Christ "ye have not life in yourselves" (chapter 6:53, Revised Version).

7. "HAVING tasted the very dregs of human affliction and temptation, He is qualified to understand the frailties and sins of men, and to pronounce judgment upon them. Therefore, the Father has given this work into the hands of His Son, knowing that He who victoriously withstood the temptations of Satan, in behalf of man, will be all-wise, just, and gracious in His dealing with him... And He who gave the light, He who has followed the soul with tenderest love and entreaty, seeking to win it from sin to holiness, He it is who is to be its final judge."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. THE thought that "the Son can do nothing of Himself" is one of wondrous depth, and the whole subject will repay careful study. In this is wrapped up the philosophy of the temptations of Christ. He came to reveal the Father, but He was tempted constantly to reveal Himself, to do something of Himself.

2. What is the "death" and what is the "life" which are contrasted in verse 24?

3. Consider the true basis for being justified by works, as shown in the life of Christ, and appealed to in verse 36.

4. Observe the number of times that Christ mentions "the Father" in this short talk with the Jews. What truth is He thus emphasizing?

5. The full force of the rebuke in verse 38 can only be appreciated by a consideration of the way in which the Jews prided themselves upon possessing the Scriptures, and their elaborate study of their outward form. Compare Matt. 22:29.
