### NOTES

1. THE first verse of this lesson contains the whole Gospel, — the love of God, the unspeakable gift (2 Cor. 9:15), as the summary of God's work for the world; faith as the means of apprehending God's gift, and eternal life as the result, on man's part. He loved "the world," He loved "the church" (Eph. 5:25), He loved "me" (Gal. 2:20). "In order to save the sinner, the Creator sacrificed Himself. The Father suffered in His Son. The measure of God's love is Christ. The Saviour's sacrifice was not to create in God a love that had not before existed; it was but the expression of a love which had not been appreciated or understood." "O, what a God have we! What a Benefactor! What claims has He upon our love! Having collected all the riches of the universe, and laid open all the resources of infinite power, He gave all the heavenly treasure into the hands of Christ, and said: 'All these are for man. Use them to convince him that there is no love greater than Mine in earth or heaven. His greatest happiness consists in loving Me and giving his heart to Me, who hath loved him with an infinite love.'" This verse completes the threefold purpose of God in giving His Son to the world, — that He might be its Life (chapter 1:4), its Light (chapter 1:9), and its Love.

2. CHRIST'S works were all wrought "in God" (chapter 14:10, 11), that they might be wrought "in us" (Isa. 26:12) by His power (Eph. 3:20), both in willing and in doing (Phil. 2:12, 13).

3. THE present possession of eternal life through faith is the lesson of verse 36. This life is in the Son (1 John 5:12), and when we receive Christ by believing on Him (chapter 1:12), it takes possession of us through the Spirit (Rom. 8:2), to be the power (Acts 1:8) that worketh in us mightily (Col. 1:29). This is not to say that we are immortal, or that we are made immortal before the coming of Christ. That which we obtain by faith we must hold by faith. Christ, who is the eternal life (1 John 5:20, last clause), dwells in our hearts by faith (Eph. 3:17). "God is the fountain of life, and we can have life only as we are in communion with Him. Separated from God, existence may be ours for a little time, but we do not possess life... Only through the surrender of our will to God is it possible for Him to impart His life to us... It will require a sacrifice to give yourself to God; but it is a sacrifice of the lower for the higher, the earthly for the spiritual, the perishable for the eternal."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. OBSERVE the many new ideas and words brought out in this lesson: Loved, everlasting life, condemnation (judgment, R. V.), purifying, bride, bridegroom, friend of the bridegroom, joy seal, wrath of God. Study them.

2. How much is included in the experience of believing on Christ?

3. The word "sent" occurs over forty times in this Gospel as applied to Christ and His work. Why is this idea emphasized so much?

4. In what way is the perpetuity of God's law taught in the sixteenth verse?

5. Observe that darkness and evil go together, and light and truth.

6. How much is included in the "above all" of verse 31?

7. How much is included in the "all things" of verse 35? See Matt. 28:18; John 17:2; 1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 1:10, etc.

8. The believer hath life, the unbeliever (he that obeyeth not, R. V.) shall not see life. What force in the change of the tense!
