### NOTES

1. HOW plainly the expression "being wearied with His journey" brings out the humanity of Christ! See Heb. 2:14, 17, and 4:15. When Jesus needs food for Himself, He waits, although "wearied," while His disciples go to buy it, but when others "have nothing to eat," He has "compassion on the multitude," and works a miracle to supply their needs. Nothing for Himself (Rom. 15:3), but everything for others (Phil. 2:4).

2. "THE Samaritans were of heathen origin" (2 Kings 17), but "an adulterated Judaism was grafted on their native religion. They accepted the five Books of Moses, and looked for a Messiahâ€”as indeed they still do. The origin of their hatred of the Jews is told in Ezra" (Ezra 4:1-3). "They were treated as heathen, who had no part in the religion of Israel. Hence the implacable religious enmity which for centuries manifested itself in all sorts of petty annoyances, and, when occasion offered, more serious injuries."

3. IT is of the greatest importance to know the gift of God, and to recognize the presence of Jesus to impart it. "If we are not deriving from Christ what we recognize as living water, it is because there is a defect in our knowledge, because we do not know the gift of God." In speaking of living water Christ "referred to the divine grace which He alone could bestow, and which is as living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul."

4. "JESUS did not intend to convey the idea that simply one draught of the water of life would satisfy the receiver; he in whom Christ abides has within himself the Fountain of life. From this source he may draw strength and grace sufficient for all his needs. Jesus will cheer the life and brighten the path of all who will receive Him. From the heart in which Christ dwells, flow out words and deeds of love that will carry a blessing to other lives. The grace of Christ in the soul is like a spring in the desert, welling up to refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish eager to drink of the water of life."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. NOTE the universal character of this lesson and the one in the previous chapter, although each was given to a single individual. What two classes are represented by Nicodemus and the woman?

2. Observe how an acquaintance with the facts of Old Testament history is taken for granted in the narratives of the New Testament, and how the two are welded together. "The New Testament is enfolded in the Old; and the Old Testament is unfolded in the New. For what is the law but the Gospel foreshadowed? and what is the Gospel but the law fulfilled?" "There are in the New Testament nearly one thousand direct quotations from, and palpable allusions to, the Old Testament scriptures."

3. This is a lesson on gifts and giving. How many times is this thought suggested? What contrast is brought out by the word "buy" in verse 8?

4. Study this lesson given by the great Teacher, as an illustration of gentleness and tact in personal labor.

5. Mark the contrasts in this lesson. Jesus "asks for a drink of water; yet He offers to set flowing wells and fountains of water. He is a suppliant for the gifts of another; yet He talks of being able to give with unlimited munificence. He is an obscure Stranger; yet He is greater than the venerable patriarch" Jacob.

6. See in the woman's question in verse 12 the great hindrance to the reception of new truth in all ages. Compare chapter 7:48, etc.

7. Compare the "living water" of this lesson with the "everlasting life" of the last lesson.
