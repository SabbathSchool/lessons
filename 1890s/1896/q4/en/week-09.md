### NOTES

1. THE fact that the Jews did not recognize the character of God in Christ (2 Cor. 5:19) showed that they did not know God. Christ was the "outshining" of God's glory (Heb. 1:3), the arm reaching down from heaven (Isa. 53:1), the means devised in infinite wisdom and condescension to reveal God to men (Matt. 11:27), and yet the very people to whom had been intrusted the oracles of God (Rom. 3:2), foretelling all these things, rejected Him (John 1:11).

2. THE rejection of Christ by us here involves His rejection of us in the heavenly courts (Luke 9:26), whither He went. Refusing to follow Him here (Matt. 16:24), we cannot follow Him there (Rev. 14:4). It is important to notice that Christ says "cannot" rather than "will not." So He said to Nicodemus "cannot see" and "cannot enter." There is only one way (John 14:6; Heb. 10:19, 20), and one name (Acts 4:12); and when these are refused, God "cannot," in harmony with His divine plan, and in view of man's freedom of choice, bring man into His presence. "The goodness of God leadeth to repentance." But it is equally true that by the mystery that attaches to our creation, man has it in his power to frustrate this intention of God. The Holy Spirit pleads with him, but he resists. He can resist. Were it not so, he would be a mere machine. "Hearts cannot be compelled; they can only be drawn. Christ knocks at the door; but we can, if we choose, keep it bolted on the inside, and Christ will not break the door down and force the way in." The choice which we are making daily is fixing our choice for eternity. What choice are we making? The personality of Christ is inseparable from His teaching. He was what He taught. He not only spoke the truth, but He was the truth; He not only revealed the way, but was Himself the way. He not only instructed them about eternal life, but He was "that eternal life." The Word was made flesh.

3. How constantly Christ presents the Father to the people, and Himself as merely the mouthpiece and representative of the Father. "The only witness He cared for was that which the Father bore to Him. Chapter 5:32; 8:18. The name in which He came was the Father's. Chapter 5:43. He professed that all the attraction wrought by Him upon men was due to His Father's agency. Chapter 6:44. He was sent by the Father; He lived by the Father; He could do nothing of Himself; the life He had was given; so also was the authority with which He executed judgment. Chapter 5:26, 27; 6:57. He spoke only as the Father taught Him. Chapter 8:28. He could dispense with all human help, because the Father never left Him alone. Chapter 8:16, 29. To honor Him, to please Him, to work His works, to live in His love, to perform His commandments, to show good works from Him, to glorify His name, to divert the attention of men to Him—such was the passion of His life." We are to follow His example (Matt. 16:24; 1 Peter 2:21), but "service like this is a fruit which can only be plucked from trees which have been planted and are tended by the Spirit of God."

4. THREE times in this gospel Christ speaks of Himself as one to "be lifted up." The first was in His private talk with Nicodemus. This is the second time He has spoken of it, but the first public mention.

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. WITH "His hour" of verse 20 compare "your hour" of Luke 22:53.

2. The people who thought that possibly He might kill Himself, probably little thought that they would kill Him. Acts 3:15. What wrought this change in their attitude toward Him?

3. What is the difference between being "in the world" and being "of the world"? Note carefully Christ's statements, I am "from above," I am "not of this world."

4. Christ says, "I judge no man" (verse 15), and, "I have many things to... judge concerning you" (verse 26, R. V.). Make the difference between these statements clear.

5. The word rendered "lifted up," in chapters 3:14; 8:28, and 12:32, is rendered "exalted" in every other place in the New Testament, with one exception only. What part did the crucifixion have in the exaltation of Christ? Compare Phil. 2:8, 9; James 4:10, etc. The cross was the ladder to the throne.

6. In what way is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?

7. Christ was what He taught, and this gave power to His teaching. What a lesson for all who would be teachers of the Word!
