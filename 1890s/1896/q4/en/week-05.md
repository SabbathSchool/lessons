### NOTES

1. "THREE times a year all the Jews were required to assemble for religious purposes at Jerusalem. Jesus had not attended several of these gatherings, because of the emnity of the Jews." It was now time for the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles. "But this feast was not solely a celebration of the ingathering, or a thanksgiving for the harvest. The name of it reminds us that another feature was quite as prominent. In its original institution God commanded, 'Ye shall dwell in booths or tabernacles seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths,' the reason being added, 'that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.' The particular significance of the Israelites dwelling in booths seems to be that it marked their deliverance from a life of bondage to a life of freedom; it reminded them how they had once no settled habitation, but yet found a booth in the desert preferable to the well-provided residences of Egypt. And every Feast of Tabernacles seemed intended to recall these thoughts." "The sons of Joseph, who passed as brothers of Jesus, were very much affected by this desertion of so many of His disciples, and, as the time approached for the Feast of Tabernacles, they urged Jesus to go up to Jerusalem, and, if He was indeed the Messiah, to present His claims before the rulers and enforce His rights." "The lever they use to move is a taunt: 'If these works of yours are genuine miracles, don't hang about villages and country towns, but go and show yourself in the capital. No one who is really confident that he has a claim on public attention wanders about in solitary places, but repairs to the most crowded haunts of men. Go up now to the feast, and your disciples will gather around you, and your claims will be settled once for all.'" "For not even His brothers were putting faith in Him." "Thus their very intimacy with Jesus, growing up with Him, as they did, from the beginning, in the same Nazareth home, not only had not predisposed them to belief in His Messiahship, but had probably prejudiced them unconsciously against such belief, the principle which prevailed with His fellow-townsmen (chapter 4:44) operating yet more powerfully with those of His own household." "At the following Passover He entered Jerusalem in the manner desired by His brethren, and the result, as he foresaw, was His death."

2. "AT the commencement of the Feast of Tabernacles, the absence of Jesus was commented upon. The Pharisees and rulers anxiously looked for Him to come, hoping that they might have an opportunity to condemn Him on account of something He might say or do. They anxiously inquired, 'Where is He?' but no one knew. Presently a dispute arose among the people in regard to Jesus, many nobly defending Him as one sent of God, while others bitterly accused Him as a deceiver of the people... In the midst of the feast, when the dispute concerning Himself was at its height, Jesus walked calmly into the court of the temple, and stood before the crowd as one possessed of unquestionable authority... They were astonished at His dignified and courageous bearing in the midst of many powerful men who were thirsting for His life. Standing thus, with the eyes of all the people riveted upon Him, He addressed them as no man had ever done. His knowledge was greater than that of the learned priests and elders, and He assumed an authority which they had never ventured to take... The hearts of the people thrilled with awe as they listened to His divine words. His discourse showed that He was well acquainted with the law in all its bearings, and was a clear interpreter of the Scriptures. The question passes from one to another, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?' Some, less acquainted with His former life, inquire in what school He has been instructed."

3.   "IF any man willeth to do His will" (R. V.). "Everything depends on the right action of the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to exercise... This will, that forms so important a factor in the character of man, was at the fall given into the control of Satan; and he has ever since been working in man to will and to do of his own pleasure, but to the utter ruin and misery of man. But the infinite sacrifice of God in giving Jesus, His beloved Son, to become a sacrifice for sin, enables Him to say, without violating one principle of His government, Yield yourself up to Me; give Me that will; take it from the control of Satan, and I will take possession of it; then I can work in you to will and to do of My good pleasure.'"

4. "IN these words (verse 20) they would insinuate that all the wonderful works of Jesus were instigated by an evil spirit. They also wish to direct the minds of the people from the words of Jesus revealing their purpose of taking His life." "Such is the climax of unbelief—death to the Christ of God! For this is its essential meaning, even where the same literal deed is impossible."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. WHEN the Jews sought to kill Jesus in Judea, He avoided that country and walked in Galilee. What lesson may we learn with reference to the question of persecution for the truth's sake?

2. Why did not God by miraculous interposition save His own Son from the murderous schemes of men? Why does He not save His people from the persecutions of wicked rulers?

3. "He deceiveth the people." Compare Rev. 12:9; 1 Tim. 2:14; 2 Thess 2:10. From the beginning of the first disaffection in heaven it has been Satan's plan to charge upon others the very things of which he is guilty himself. What blindness of mind when the arch-deceiver himself can persuade men to charge Christ, "The Faithful and True Witness," with being "that deceiver"!

4. What is the force of the appeal to Moses and the law in verse 19?
