# A WATCHMAN ON THE WALL
# A PIONEER IN THE WILDERNESS

As the watchman is placed to descry the approach of friend or foe, and proclaim what he sees to those within the walls, so the Signs of the Times stands to warn the dwellers of earth of the approach of the hastening day of the Lord, terrible for the careless and unready, full of hope and everlasting joy for the faithful ones awaiting the return of their Master.

As the pioneer goes forth into the untrodden wilderness, clears away obstructions and makes a path for the on following of his fellowmen in the march of Progress, so the Signs of the Times goes forth into the wilderness of the world's errors, and with its sharp cleaver cuts away the tangled undergrowth and overgrowth and lets in heaven's bright beams of light upon a pathway prepared for its fellow workers, the Bible reader, the minister, the missionary in any branch of the Master's service.

"I know of dozens of cases where people have become interested and have come into the truth by reading the SIGNS. I have seen over a dozen the fruits of my labor,—not I, but the Lord gets the credit. May the Lord send out more reapers, for the harvest is ripe,"—so says one of our old workers.

How does it go? By means of its friends. It has many, it wants more. Are you befriending it, and thus working with God, whose servants are all? Canvassers are needed, donations are needed for supplying reading matter to needy individuals and fields. Will you help?

A volume of 832 pages, with several special issues during the year, each beautifully illustrated, for one dollar. Price of the paper six months 50 cents, three months 25 cents.

Agents are wanted who can devote all or a part of their time to canvassing for the SIGNS. Write us for further information, for terms and outfit.

## REPRESENTATIVE OPINION

We quote the following from a letter recently received from the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Tract Society concerning the "Desire of Ages," as it gives in a few words the almost universal opinion of those who have read the book:

> "May the Lord continue to bless in the work there and every means used to introduce this wonderful book. There never was a book published by Seventh-day Adventists that equals it. It is the power of the gospel, and every soul that reads its pages must be lifted higher and higher in the plane of holy living. Yours for the cause of truth."

Good active agents will find this a truly "wonderful book" to introduce to the people, and one that will do a vast amount of good. Complete canvassing outfit, post-paid, $1.25. Descriptive circular sent free.

## 36,923 PAGES DAILY

Such was the average daily sale of the tracts published in the Bible Students' and Apples of Gold Libraries during our business year which closed March 31, 1899.

This will undoubtedly be largely increased during the present year on account of the better rate of discount which is now allowed. It is as follows:

Forty per cent. discount from retail prices with POSTAGE ADDED, provided that 100 or more tracts in UNBROKEN PACKAGES are ordered at one time.

The new Library Order Sheet tells just how many tracts each package contains, thus enabling you to secure this special quantity reduction. This order sheet sent free to applicants.

This discount applies to the tracts published in "Bible Students'," "Apples of Gold," "Words of Truth," and "Religious Liberty Libraries."

## BIBLES - A FRESH NEW STOCK

During the past two years there has been issued an almost endless variety of Bibles, bound in split-leather, sheepskin, cloth, etc., and described as "Morocco" bindings.

In comparing the descriptions of these bindings with those listed in our Catalog, some people have thought our prices high when they were really very low.

Now, to avoid all misunderstanding, we are issuing a new Bible Catalog which tells, just as far as we can learn, the quality of leather used in each style of binding.

That this Catalog may represent the best Bibles on the market to-day, it is largely devoted to the newest editions published; the most of our older stock having been disposed of at a sacrifice to make room for that which is better.

The net prices of the publishers are strictly adhered to.

This Catalog is free.
