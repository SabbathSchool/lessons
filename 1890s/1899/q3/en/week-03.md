## NOTES

1. Decapolis means "ten cities." Nine of these lay east of the Jordan, and one on the west. The country round about these cities was therefore called Decapolis. From Matt. 4:23-25 and Mark 7:31 it would appear that this general appellation was given to quite a large district extending along both sides of the Jordan. According to Pliny, it was confined to the eastern side of the river, and extended from Damascus on the north to the brook Jabbok on the south. This was a region particularly disliked by the Jews, because ten cities therein located, had municipal governments distinct from Jewish interference—though in Palestine—and had joined together in a political alliance against all Israel. They afterward perished by fire and sword, and the entire region, once so densely populated, is said to be now almost without inhabitants.

2. This reveals how impossible it was for the Son of God to be hid. The popular excitement, however, only served to make His enemies hate Him the more, because the people were not only enjoying the rich blessings of His spiritual teaching, but were also experiencing the power of Heaven in healing their maladies, which was a foretaste of the kingdom of God restored.

3. Mark says this was done to tempt Him. The word "tempt" as here used means to try, or prove. It appears that they were not satisfied with His past demonstrations of infinite power, and would have others to gratify their own curiosity. Christ, however, would throw away no miracles on these agnostics. They would not have believed had their request been granted. It is evident that the two parties united on this occasion for a mischievous purpose.

4. Strange that they should so soon forget that Christ Himself was living bread, and that those who possessed Him could never hunger. John 6:33, 36. His reminder of the two miracles, when food was created for the multitude, was to impress the thought that where He is there can be no lack, because He is living bread, and that His spoken Word can, when necessary, take material form, and become a nourishing substance for the body.

5. It must be remembered that Christ was a fugitive from the malice of His enemies, and so the less publicity given to His acts and words the safer He would be, until the hour should come for Him to be delivered up. Luke 22:53.
