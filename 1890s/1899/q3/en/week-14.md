## NOTES

1. It seems strange at this distance that, after so much and such recent instruction concerning the part Jesus was to act, the disciples should still cling to their traditional dream of an earthly Messianic kingdom. But theirs is a case of religious teaching in which the whole life becomes so moulded as to prove almost hopelessly fixed. Inasmuch as human nature is the same in every age, how important that parents see to it that their children are now diligently taught in the principles of eternal truth!

2. This case shows that the general sentiment of the great masses is not always correct. Had these two forlorn men obeyed the public demand, they would have remained in their sad plight. But the acute sense of their needs, and their intense desire for help, that they knew could be had from no other source, impelled them to disregard the popular demand. So it is now; in order to be healed from spiritual blindness, one must definitely and resolutely appeal to the Lord, despite the general demand for quiet.

3. The publicans were tax collectors. This man, being "chief among the publicans," was probably the superintendent of customs, or tribute, for the district of Jericho. These tax collectors were famous for being extortioners in their business, and it is not strange, therefore, that this Jew (for such his name implies) was "rich."

4. The course Zaccheus marked out for himself was the best of evidence that his heart had undergone a great change. The same principle still holds good, that he who claims to love the Lord, and knowingly withholds from others that which he has wrongfully taken from them, has not had that radical change of heart necessary to enjoy the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
