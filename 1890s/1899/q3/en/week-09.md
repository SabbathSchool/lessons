## NOTES

1. The words of this warning are evidence that the Jews were maliciously trying publicly to cover up their better sentiments concerning Christ. The evidence of His Messiahship was ample for even the dullest mind, and for this reason the Lord said that even the heathen would rise up in the last day to condemn their words. In this way their covered feelings would be revealed, and what they had talked in confidence to close friends would be openly proclaimed. How much better to ever stand on principle, even though obliged to stand alone, than to smother sacred convictions for the sake of popularity!

2. The root from whence "sparrow," of this text comes, is one which means "chirp" or "twitter," hence a small chirping bird, as the rock sparrow, said to be common in Palestine. They were secured by being knocked down by sticks in the hands of hunters. Brought to market, five of these were sold for the smallest piece of bronze money, known as lepton, equal in value to about one-eighth of a cent.

3. The word "fool" occurs frequently in the New Testament. In some places the original means thoughtless, as in Luke 24:25; in others, a rebel, as in Matt. 23:17, 19. In this text it carries the sense of a heedless person.
