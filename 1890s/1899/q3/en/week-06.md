## NOTES

1. These "brethren" were probably the relatives from Nazareth, who had called at Capernaum on their way to the feast at Jerusalem, hoping to have Jesus there join their caravan. Having not yet declared themselves on His behalf, they desired Him to accompany them to the feast, and there, at the Jewish metropolis, demonstrate His claims to the Messiahship. They did not believe it the part of wisdom for Him to remain in the remote parts of Galilee, if He expected to establish the Messianic kingdom. They urged that He should go where the world at large could see and know Him.

2. It would not do to journey to the feast amid a crowd, as such a course might precipitate a popular movement against Him, and prematurely destroy His life. He would wait for a quiet discussion concerning Him to settle personal convictions with each, before showing Himself openly.

3. The closing expression of verse 19 makes it evident that the question of the Jews in verse 15 was one intended to excite doubt and suspicion in the popular mind against Christ and His teaching. It is also evident from the further answer of Christ that they had even charged Him with being a violator of the law, by referring to His healing a man on the Sabbath day at the Passover a few months earlier. See chap. 5:1-9. The Feast of Tabernacles was at the end of September or early in October, while the Passover came the last of March, or the first of April.

4. It is a remarkable fact that the Jews have never attempted to deny the reality of the miracles which Jesus wrought. All they can say is that He did the work by the power of Beelzebub.
