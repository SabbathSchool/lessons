## NOTES

1. The feast of tabernacles came late in the autumn, after the ingathering of the harvest, in the seventh month. Lev. 23:34. The feast of the dedication to commemorate the purging of the temple, and the rebuilding of the altar, after Judas Maccabeus had driven out the Syrians in B.C. 164, was held in the ninth month. As Jesus desired to be present at the latter (John 10:22, 23), He did not return to Galilee, but spent the intervening time in Judea. His time was getting very short, and as little labor had been bestowed upon Judea during His ministry, He therefore organized the large force of seventy disciples to go before Him to the various towns as heralds of His approach. In this way, the people would be prepared for His coming, and much more could be accomplished in the short time left for His earthly ministry. This is a significant fact, and one that should influence our actions, the nearer the end draws on.

2. It will be noticed that after telling the seventy how to conduct themselves upon entering a house, and receiving its benefits, the Lord laid obligations upon them to return a blessing upon the household. This was on the principle that in caring for the Lord's messengers, the people were entertaining the Lord Himself (Matt. 25:40), which act could not fail of its reward (Matt. 10:40-42).

3. The statement of the fall of Satan, or the adversary, was to remind the disciples that the Lord's conquering power had already vanquished their enemy, and that they should not be elated as though their ability had accomplished the work. The only thing for any to rejoice in is that the Lord has elevated them from the depths of sin, to have their name registered among the family of heaven.

4. Bethany, the home of Martha and Mary, was situated on the east side of the Mount of Olives, about fifteen stadia, or nearly two miles, from Jerusalem. It is said to have been, in the days of Christ, a beautiful, retired spot, amid green fields, hidden among the surrounding heights. It is now a wretched, ruinous village, of not more than a score of families, existing under the name of El-Azarieh or Lazarieh.
