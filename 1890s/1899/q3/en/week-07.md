## NOTES

1. The word "door" is here used in the sense of means of entrance, just as faith was made a door unto the Gentiles. Acts 14:27. Christ is the door to the sheep-fold, through whom all must enter. Heb. 7:25. He Himself, as leader and care-taker of the sheep, must go before the sheep, and prepare the way, by faith. Those who follow must have His faith, the faith of Jesus. To all such the door opens just as readily as for the One who prepared the way.

2. The adjective "good," in verse 11, is from the word kalos, meaning beautiful, pleasing. Christ is therefore a beautiful, pleasing, and therefore an attractive shepherd, one who gives joy to those who follow Him. He draws them after Him by His pleasing gentleness. Ps. 18:35; John 12:32.
