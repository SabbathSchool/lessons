## NOTES

1. The town bearing this name lay to the northeast of the plain of El Huleh. It was close to the territory of Dan, and nearly due east from Tyre. The town had been formerly known as Baal-Gad, so named from the Canaanite god of fortune. It was rebuilt by the tetrarch Philip, three years before the birth of Christ, and named Caesarea, in honor of Augustus, the reigning emperor; hence its name. It was called Panium by Josephus, but is now known as Banias.

2. It is upon the rock of this revelation that the church of Christ is built. When guided by the Spirit of God, His representatives will do and speak as led by that power, and so their loosing and binding is sanctioned in heaven. See side texts. When Peter said by the Spirit to the lame man at the gate of the temple, "Rise up and walk," the result was the same as though the words were uttered direct from heaven.

3. Only three were permitted to see this wonderful sight—those who constituted the innermost circle of the Lord's followers. The same trio were the only ones admitted into the death chamber of the little maid (Luke 8:51), and were also the exclusive companions of the Lord during His passion in the garden. Just why this was we do not fully know, but one thing is taught by the example—that, while the Lord's work recognizes no favorites, in a low sense, there are some whom he permits to enter deeper into the mysteries of His doings than others. This being so, all should trust God's wisdom and justice, and know that God reigns over His work and people in the earth.

4. The very fact that Peter included Elias (Elijah) in the number to dwell in one of the three tabernacles he suggested to have made, shows that he still believed that that prophet was yet to come and live with the Messiah on the earth forever. He, therefore, could not understand the statement that Christ was to die and be raised again. This only illustrates how tenaciously one clings to his old, preconceived ideas, in spite of the plain teaching of the Word of God.
