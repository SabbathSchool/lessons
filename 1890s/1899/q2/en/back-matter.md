## Reduced Tract Prices

**TO OUR FRIENDS AND CUSTOMERS:**

We have reduced the price of the tracts published in the Bible Students' and Apples of Gold Libraries.

This has been done because we want you to use more of them, and as you give the most of them away, you should get them as cheap as possible.

The price as now fixed is so very low that it can be allowed only where 100 or More Tracts in Unbroken Packages are ordered at a time, for example:

| THE RIGHT WAY | | | THE WRONG WAY | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 B. S. L. No. 155 at 2c, | $0.50 | | 40 B. S. L. No. 155 at 2c, | $0.80 | |
| 25 " " 152 " 2c, | $0.50 | | 10 " " 152 " 2c, | $0.20 | |
| 25 " " 104 " 1c, | $0.25 | | 35 " " 104 " 1c, | $0.35 | |
| 25 " " 105 " 1c, | $0.25 | | 15 " " 105 " 1c, | $0.15 | |
| 100 Tracts. | $1.50 | | 100 Tracts. | $1.50 | |

On "the right way" a discount would be allowed, as the 100 tracts are ordered in unbroken packages. On "the wrong way" no discount would be allowed, although 100 tracts are ordered, because packages are broken.

When ordered "the right way" a discount of 40 per cent from regular prices will be given.

About twenty thousand pages of these tracts are sold daily, and a strict adherence to this rule will effect an immense saving in time, both in counting and billing—and you get its benefit.

A new order sheet has just been prepared which gives the number of tracts in a package, thus enabling you to conform to the above rule. It's free. Ask your tract society for it.

## Economic Facts

One Sixteenth of the entire wealth of the United States was absorbed by Trusts in 1898 alone.

During the first 15 days in December, 1896, Chicago Station Houses sheltered 642 homeless men. For the same time in 1896, 15,521 were thus sheltered; while for that time in 1897, the number was only limited by the capacity of the houses.

It is such conditions as the above upon which our new book, **Heralds of the Morning**, treats; not that it is entirely devoted to the social question, however, but that it is entirely devoted to the signs of our times, of which that perplexing question is a part. Farther than that, it introduces only such signs as are of common occurrence, and which may be observed by every one. It is therefore a book of general interest. The engravings are very fine; in fact they really illustrate the book. It will probably be the easiest selling subscription book of the year.

Address your State Tract Society for outfit and terms.

## NOW WE WANT AGENTS

Although "The Desire of Ages" was published last November, it is only recently that a special call has been made for agents. The reason has been that the most of the first edition was bought by our own people, and about as fast as it could be bound up, too. But a second edition has been published, and we want agents to take it to the world.

"The Desire of Ages" is filled with attractive truth and beautiful pictures, and is an ideal book for canvassers to handle. Complete outfit post-paid $1.25. Address your State Tract Society.
