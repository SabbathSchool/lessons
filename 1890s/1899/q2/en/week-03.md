### NOTES

1. "Sea of Galilee;" so called because of the province of that name, which formed its western shore. It was also known as Lake Gennesaret, because of a most beautiful and fertile plain by that name, which bordered on one of its northwestern indentures; it was called the Sea of Tiberias, from the city of Tiberias, which was located on its western shore; and, in ancient times, it was called the Sea of Chinnereth, from a town of that name near it. See Num. 34:11; Josh. 12:3; 19:35.

2. Some months before this, these men had voluntarily, but temporarily, it seems, joined themselves to Christ, as related in John 1:35-42. No one had, as yet, fully united as colaborer with Christ. These men had listened to His teaching and witnessed His miracles, but, having also seen the combination of religious leaders against Christ, they had found relief in assuming their former occupation.

3. These were words only of discouragement. All night Peter had toiled in vain. "During the lonely hours he had thought of the fate of John the Baptist, who was languishing alone in his dungeon. He had thought of the prospect before Jesus and His followers, of the ill success of the mission to Judea, and the malice of the priests and rabbis. Even his own occupation had failed him; and as he watched by the empty nets, the future had seemed dark with discouragement."â€”Desire of Ages, p. 245.

4. Conflicting emotions overcame the erring disciple. He had, in great measure, lost sight of Christ's calling, of which he had been convinced a few months before. His was now the cry of self-loathing, as his true self of unbelief and unholiness was clearly revealed by the flash of supernatural illumination.

5. A strong expression, literally, "be thou muzzled." The Lord would not recognize this satanic testimony to His office and work. But His calm intrepidity gave force to His word of authority; and a dignified standing to His heavenly message. For further comments on this case, see "Desire of Ages," pp. 255, 256.
