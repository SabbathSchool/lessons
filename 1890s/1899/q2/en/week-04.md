### NOTES

1. It appears that, although Peter's home had shortly before been at Bethsaida (John 1:44), a little southwest of Capernaum, on the sea, he was at this time living in the house with his wife's mother in the latter place. On this particular occasion James and John, as well as Andrew and Peter, were present.

2. Jewish tradition had placed so many restrictions around the Sabbath that none were supposed, on that day, to make a journey of more than two thousand paces. It was also considered unlawful to heal the sick on that day. Luke 6:7; 13:14; John 5:18; 9:16. These regulations gave the Saviour a short respite from labor. But from the report of the incident in the synagogue during the service of the day, every one was in expectation. All knew where Jesus was quartered, and as soon as the trumpet blast announced the Sabbath closed, all the people of that region flocked to Peter's house, bringing their sick with them. Every disease was there representedâ€”leprosy, fever, asthma, consumption, dropsy, palsy, deaf, dumb, and those possessed with devils.

3. Leprosy was a loathsome disease of that day, supposed by some to be similar to the worst form of modern elephantiasis. It began in small specks on the eyelids or hands, and spread until it affected every part of the body, causing angry swellings and putrefying sores. From the skin it ate through the tissues to the bones, rotting the entire body by degrees. When the malady arrived at this stage, death was a welcome messenger. The man in this case was "full" of the dread disease which debarred him from approaching a member of the community, or permitting another to come toward him without his giving the warning cry, "Unclean, unclean." Faith alone in the saving power of Christ, after hearing of and perhaps seeing from afar His wonderful work, could possibly have induced him to be so bold.

4. It was early in the ministry of Christ for so great a stir to be made as was sure to follow public announcement of such miraculous healing, as it would likely precipitate undue opposition from the priests, and this would interfere with the intended work of Christ. See Isa. 42:2, 4. So the word was, "See thou say nothing to any man." Jesus knew that it was better to let the priest decide that the man's leprosy was departed, and so publish it, as the law required.
