### NOTES

1. Our last lesson left the Saviour in Jerusalem, where the Jews were seeking to kill Him. John 5:18. The place of John's imprisonment, according to Josephus, was in the strong fortress of Machaerus, nearly northeast of Jerusalem, on the frontiers of Arabia. Later, at the time of the Baptist's death, Herod had his court in a mansion adjoining the prison.

2. It is difficult to determine how long after Christ's baptism this tour of Galilee began. We know, however, that a great part of that interval was spent in Judea. The purpose of this is easily perceived. It seemed necessary to spend much time at first in the vicinity of Jerusalem, in order to give the leading Jews an opportunity to decide concerning His Messiahship. John having been rejected and cast into prison, Jesus proceeded to Galilee, there to call the twelve disciples, and to enter more fully upon His ministry. There is no record of His being much in Judea after this, except at the annual feasts, where He appeared in harmony with the requirements of the Levitical law.

3. At the scene of His childhood, youth, and young manhood—at the very point where He was best known—He gave His personal acquaintances the same opportunity that had been afforded the people of Judea.

4. "Capernaum" means the village of Nahum. It was on the west shore of the Sea of Galilee, near its head, or northern end, and was the boundary town between the territory of Philip and Antipas, hence contained a custom-house and garrison. Luke 5:27; 7:2.
