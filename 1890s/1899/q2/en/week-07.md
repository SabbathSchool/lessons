### NOTES

1. There was much involved in these questions, to cut the proud, deceitful Pharisees to the heart. The queries really contrasted His life and work with theirs.

2. "He stretched it out," withered though it had been. The power to do so was in the word by which the action was commanded. Christ's enemies were by this method foiled in their efforts to find in the act of Christ a violation of the Sabbath law. The Saviour was indignant at their voluntary blindness, yet He carefully wrought so as to give them no hold on Him. Ordering the crippled man to stand forth in plain sight of them all, He laid no hand on him. He did not even question him. He but spoke, and the man was healed. It was not unlawful to speak on the Sabbath, even by their most rigorous rule of observance. But they were filled with "senseless rage" (Greek of Luke 6:11) at what they witnessed, and were more determined than ever to destroy Jesus.

3. The Herodians had been regarded by the Pharisees as apostate, on account of their alliance with the Roman power, and consequent imitation of heathen practices. So far had they gone in flattery of the reigning house that they tried to represent Herod the Great as the promised Messiah. (Farrar's "Life of Christ.") This, of course, made them the natural enemies of Christ and His work. The Pharisees, in their mad rage, were willing to be reconciled to such a hateful sect, in order to secure their cooperation to destroy One holding doctrines so noble as to shame their lives, even though no other charge could be sustained against Him.
