### READING
Luke 11:14-36; Mark 3:22-31; "Desire of Ages," pp. 321-327.

### NOTES

1. This was probably to draw the Saviour out in private company in a way to compromise Himself, so that evidence might be found against Him, sufficient to condemn Him. For evidence of this, see Luke 11:37-54.

2. The custom of the Jews was to sit at meals, having the feet crossed beneath the body. See side texts with question 2. The same custom now prevails in the East, with tables about a foot high. In Christ's day the custom of the Persians, Greeks, and Romans, of reclining on cushions, had become common. The guest lay on his left arm, with feet extended outside.

3. For the master of a house to meet his guest with a kiss on the cheek, and to invoke a blessing upon him, was a formal welcome. This was always followed by bringing water to wash the guest's feet, in order to remove the dust. The head and beard were next anointed with fragrant oil, either by the host or one of his servants. This last was an especial point of etiquette.

4. The Jews themselves pretended to cast out demons, but they had never shown power to make the blind see, and the dumb speak. This was what so hurt the proud Pharisees. They could not deny the miracle, and what was more, they saw that the common people would recognize its genuineness, and so they feared the result.

5. This was an expression meaning, "Is not this the Messiah?" It was the first general public confession of Christ as to His true mission, and it only angered the Pharisees.

6. Beelzebubâ€”the filth god. Mark says they charged Him with having an "unclean" spirit. The Phenicians assigned to this god the power to inflict diseases of all kinds. They implied that the unclean spirit on Him had made Him mad, and turned His brain. See also John 10:20. When this report reached His brethren, they went to take Him home, because they said He was "beside Himself."

7. Vast multitudes had followed John, and seemed temporarily benefited by his ministrations. The old, unclean spirit had, for a time, seemed to be gone out of the people. But inasmuch as they refused to let God's Spirit come in and fill them, Jesus predicted that their old spirit, with others still worse, would come in to dwell with them, and they would be worse than before. This was but to foretell His rejection by them. For application of the "diseased eye," see "Desire of Ages," p. 322.
