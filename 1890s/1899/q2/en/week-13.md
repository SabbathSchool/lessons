### NOTES

1. "Calling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two and two through the towns and villages. None were sent forth alone, but brother was associated with brother, friend with friend. Thus they could help and encourage each other, counseling and praying together, each one's strength supplementing the other's weakness. In the same manner He afterward sent forth the seventy. It was the Saviour's purpose that the messengers of the Gospel should be associated in this way. In our own time evangelistic work would be far more successful if this example were more closely followed."â€”Desire of Ages, p. 350.

2. It is said to have been while Herod Antipas was on a visit to Rome, and was the guest of his brother Philip (not the tetrarch of that name, but a son of Herod the Great by Mariamne, who, being disinherited by his father, was living privately in Rome), that he became ensnared by his brother's wife, and repaid the hospitality he had received by eloping with her.

3. Tradition says that Herodias ordered the body to be thrown over the battlements of the palace, for dogs and vultures to devour.
