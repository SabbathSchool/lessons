## SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS

*Please Read Carefully*

Do not be satisfied with formally looking over the lesson. Do not be satisfied with even a fair study of the text cited at the close of each question. The life of Christ cannot be learned from any single account of an evangelist, for the reason that some details omitted by one are supplied by another. In fact, some incidents in the life of Christ are entirely omitted by one or more of His biographers. This statement will be more fully appreciated by comparing the tables of contents in the accounts of the four evangelists, as shown by any Harmony of the Gospels.

But it is not enough simply to know historically the life of Christ. His doings and sayings should be studied for the spiritual force which may be derived from them. This cannot be accomplished by passing hastily over the lessons. Let every one, then, take time to meditate on them, not forgetting to ask for the illuminating power of the Holy Spirit. Earnest, faithful study of these lessons is sure to bring to the student "a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose that are rarely seen in these times."

**THE SURPLUS DONATIONS** during the present quarter will be used in the most needy foreign fields.
