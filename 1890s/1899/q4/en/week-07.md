## NOTE

Mark says that after the public silencing of the Pharisees, "the common people heard Him gladly." They were then prepared to hear dark revelations concerning their former leaders. After they had perceived the hypocrisy of the men in high places, there was no longer any danger of their turning against their Lord. On the other hand, their attitude would deter the officials from laying violent hands on Christ until He had fully brought out their character in its true light. His words of condemnation on this occasion were most scathing; yet they were those of gentleness; to the Pharisees, however, they were but the voice of volumed terror. Never were more terrible denunciations uttered than were heaped on those Pharisees. Yet this was done without any commingling of sinful passion, or of revengeful malice. His words were those of the Eternal Judge, which all who shall be found at last in the same class, will hear concerning themselves.

How different the words of this last day's message in the temple, from the teaching of the Saviour on the mount of blessing. The words of blessing were uttered on a mountain-side of Galilee; the words of woe were pronounced in the courts of the Lord's house. But it cannot be that these woes were uttered simply because those men were sinners. There must have been something with them more terrible than mere acts of evil; for to the woman taken in adultery the Saviour kindly said: "Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more." But to the haughty Pharisees at whose table Christ sat, He spoke altogether differently. These woes were directed against those who cherished hidden sins, —corruption of heart,—while they outwardly posed as God's servants. Hypocrisy must therefore be one of the most hideous, nauseating sins in God's sight, especially where its influence is used to lead souls to perdition.

The Gospel is therefore like the cloudy-fiery pillar,—a glowing light to the faithful, but a lowering gloom to the faithless; to some it speaks tenderness, to others terror; to some it is all blessing, to others it proves a curse.
