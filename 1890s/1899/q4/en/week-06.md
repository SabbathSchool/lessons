## NOTES

1. It will be seen that the scripture quoted by the Sadducees had nothing to do with the conclusion they drew; so that theirs was a hasty and ill-advised deduction. They probably supposed that such conclusion naturally followed the command which they quoted from the Pentateuch, but it was not so; hence the Saviour's rebuke of their lack of knowledge, both of Scripture and the power of God.

2. Christ might easily have proved the resurrection from Job, Isaiah, David, and other prophets, but He chose to meet this question with the words of Moses, the only inspired writer that the Sadducees believed in. It was useless to cite authorities for them in which they had no faith, a lesson worth remembering in our day.

3. These two principles being eternal, and the whole law hanging on them, or being drawn out, from them, must be just as eternal as that on which it hangs, or depends, for support.
