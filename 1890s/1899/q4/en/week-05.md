## NOTES

1. The early part of the parable refers to the Jews scorning the Saviour, and suffering the loss of their city in consequence. The latter part clearly shows the Gentiles being brought into the plan of salvation, and traces the whole through the closing scenes of earth and the judgment.

2. From Rev. 19:8, it is clear that the royal wedding garment is the righteousness, which the Lord provides every one whom He calls to the wedding. All can have it who will. So, then, if any neglect or refuse this gift on the conditions offered, and still persist in attending the wedding, as a guest, without the wedding garment, he will have no excuse.

3. In their secret council, they concluded not only to set spies on Christ's track, but to engage the Herodians in the task of overthrowing Him, in order to give their work less of a Pharisaic character. The latter stood on the principles of Jewish theocracy, drawing their inspiration from Deut. 17:15. To this scripture they appealed when Rome took possession of the throne of Judea. The Herods were of Idumean extraction, though having intermarried with the Jews to some extent. The Herodians were believers in the right of the Herods to the throne. But when these were taken away, and Pilate, a purely Roman governor, was installed in their place, the Herodians felt free to unite with the Pharisees in demanding the rights of the Jews. Yet even in this they were inconsistent, since it was Roman power alone that had kept the Herods on the throne. They, however, agreed to assist in trapping Christ in some unlawful statement concerning the political situation.
