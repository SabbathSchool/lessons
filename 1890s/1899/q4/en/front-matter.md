## NOTE TO THE STUDENT

The lessons of this quarter deepen in interest over preceding lessons of the series, embracing as they do, a portion of the last week of Christ's earthly ministry. The scenes they represent, and the principles they teach, should be so carefully studied as to become indelibly impressed upon the mind of every pupil. Observation has shown that preceding lessons have been too long for the average class to cover in a single recitation. These have, therefore, been purposely made shorter, that the interested recital may not be hindered before reaching the end of the lesson. May this part of the life of the divine Master, not only be studied for recitation, but fully copied in the daily life of all concerned.

THE SURPLUS DONATIONS during the present quarter will be used in the most needy foreign fields.
