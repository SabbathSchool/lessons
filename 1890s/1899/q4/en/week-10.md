## NOTES

1. These days of persecution were predicted to be 1260 years in duration. Dan. 7:25. But, as foretold in the text, these days were shortened, lest all of God's people should be destroyed. In the providence of God various causes operated to stop the general persecution of God's people prior to the close of the 1260 years which began in 538 A.D. and ended in 1798. The enlightenment of Europe through the powerful influence of the Reformation resulted in a public sentiment which would not allow such persecutions as had been prevalent, and edicts of toleration were issued by ruling monarchs of Europe about 1775-76. Since the latter date there has been no general persecution. The student should note the exactness of the prophecy. In Matthew the record says, "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light." In Mark it says, "In those days, after that tribulation." The darkening of the sun and moon, May 18, 1780, occurred "immediately after the tribulation of those days," and these events came "in those days after that tribulation." Any darkening of the sun and moon occurring on any date not included between 1776 and 1798 could not be the signs foretold by our Saviour.

2. "No man maketh known" is the sense of the text. Several translations render the text in this way. We have a parallel in 1 Cor. 2:2, where Paul says, "I determined not to know," that is, I determined not to make known. The day and hour of Christ's coming will not be made known by man, angels, nor by the Son, but by the Father only. And certainly no man can make known the time till it is made known by the Father. As He has not revealed the time in the Scriptures, we know it has not yet been revealed.
