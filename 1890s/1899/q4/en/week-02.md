## NOTES

1. Bethphage, the "House of Figs," was situated on the Mount of Olives, near Bethany.

2. Christ's entry into Jerusalem, at the Feast of Tabernacles, had been made secretly, and on foot. This time He will go in riding on an ass, the ancient symbol of Jewish royalty, even as David and the judges of Israel had done before Him. In contrast to the horse, introduced by Solomon for war purposes, the ass was an emblem of peace. As the Prince of Peace, the Saviour of men approached the city of the great King for the last time, only to find the hearts of its rulers steeled against Him. He knew, too, that the act would hasten His death, yet He must fulfil what was written concerning Him.

3. Spreading their own garments under Christ was the initial act of proclaiming Him King. Doubtless they thought the long-expected Messianic reign was about to open.

4. Josephus estimates the number usually present in Jerusalem at a Passover, to be about 3,000,000, more than two-thirds of the entire population of Judea and Galilee. The city could not contain them. All the environs,—even the slopes of Mt. Olivet itself, which looked toward the city,—were covered with the booths of the pilgrims. "Much people" were indeed present. Everything was favorable for the greatest demonstration toward making Christ the long-expected King.

5. So Christ was in the midst of admirers, actually permitting Himself to be proclaimed King. He accepted the title, and received the homage, a thing He never did before. The hopes of His followers were greatly raised, and they shouted with unwonted vigor, while chanting that part of the "great Hallel" which they had been so long accustomed to repeat when partaking of the Passover lamb, the symbol of the Messiah.

6. Inasmuch as the prophet had said that these words would be repeated at just such a time, they must be heard, even though the stones of earth cry out, because the Word of God cannot be broken. What He says is sure to come to pass, even though it must be done in the most improbable way.

7. Jesus knew full well how soon the homage being bestowed on Him would pass away. As the fading sunlight broke over the city, the thought of what it might be, in contrast with what it would be because of His rejection, overcame Him, and He groaned aloud. Had Jerusalem but owned Him, she might have been the queen of all cities, because of the honor He would have bestowed on her.

8. How little the people realized the meaning of those sorrowful words. A generation later the Roman army was encamped on the very spot from whence these words were uttered, and it laid in ashes all the splendor of the city as it appeared on the day of Christ's triumphal entry thereto.
