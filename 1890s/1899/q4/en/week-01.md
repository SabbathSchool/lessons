## READING
"Desire of Ages," chapter 62; "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2, chapter 32.

## NOTES

1. Some have concluded that the anointing of Jesus recorded in Luke 7:36-50, and the one described in Matt. 26:6-16, are the same, because in "Desire of Ages" and in "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2, the two accounts are blended in one. This is not a necessary conclusion, because we find similar events spoken of in the same connection in the Scriptures, as though they were one and the same, and yet they were far removed from each other in point of time. The prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem and the second coming of Christ, as recorded in Matthew 24, is an example.

2. This was the costliest anointing oil known. It was made from an Indian plant, and sold throughout the Roman Empire at fabulous prices. It was a common thing to anoint the heads of rabbis, and special guests at marriage feasts, with fragrant oil, but this surpassed anything in that line then known. Her great sacrifice revealed the depth of Mary's love for her Master. Reckoning according to the standard of that day, this was more than Â£10, or about $50.
