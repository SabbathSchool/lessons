## NOTE

The parable of the ten virgins met its fulfillment in the experience of God's people in 1844, when the great advent movement reached its climax. This included a period of six months, ending with October 22, 1844. The midnight cry was given, commencing in July of that year and continued till October 22. See "Life of William Miller," "Life Sketches," and "Last Day Tokens."

The talents in this parable represent the gifts which God bestows upon His people to use for Him. They include all temporal and spiritual blessings, and they are given "to every man according to his several ability." Verse 15. That is according to his ability to use them. See Eph. 4:8-16; 1 Corinthians 12. While the principles taught in this parable have always applied to the experience of God's people, they will be understood better, and be applied more closely in the last days, after the giving of the signs. Like the parable of the ten virgins, it is placed chronologically in connection with Christ's teaching in regard to His second coming and the judgment.
