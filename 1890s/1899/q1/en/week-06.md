## NOTES

1. Bethabara was beyond the Jordan, that is, on the east bank of that river, supposed to have been nearly opposite Jericho. It is not positively identified. See "Smith's Bible Dictionary."

2. This was characteristic of the Saviour through all His work. His modesty on this occasion is a standing model for every professed Christian. As He was retiring and modest, in this first public act of His life, so may all become the same, and demonstrate their worthiness to be counted His followers.

3. Never before had such an answer to prayer been realized. The form taken by the Holy Spirit on this occasion is certainly suggestive. It was in the beautiful form and gentle motion of the dove, the appropriate symbol of gentleness and affection. It identified Him as the meek and lowly One, the kind and loving Saviour. That Spirit is the same today, and when received, points out the receiver as being peaceable and "gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy." James 3:17.
