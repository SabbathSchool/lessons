## NOTES

1. Every movement of Christ was controlled by the Spirit, of which He was "full." John 1:16. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Luke 1:35. The Spirit was not given to Him by measure. John 3:34. The Holy Spirit was the source of His power. Acts 10:38. Through this He was spotless. Heb. 9:14. By the same He gave directions to His apostles concerning their work, after His resurrection. Acts 1:2.

2. The object must have been twofold: (1) He must undergo temptation in its most direct and potent way, in order that He might reach the depth of human suffering in that line, and so know how to sympathize with those whom He came to save. (2) These days were also to serve for Him as a season of meditation and preparation for the great work before Him. It was also to be a season of triumph, not only over Satan in his direct attacks, but also a triumph over the flesh, by absorbing, elevating communion with Godâ€”a lesson for all who have been intrusted with responsibilities in the work of salvation.

3. He was probably so absorbed by His devotions in the face of a persistent enemy, that He did not feel the need of food. It will be noticed that both Mark and Luke imply that the Saviour was being tempted at every stage of the forty days' fast. It may be that during that time the question was being revolved, from His human side, as to whether He was really having God's protection, while being left in so desolate a place. This is suggested by the attack of Satan after Christ became sensible to hunger.

4. Forty days before, at His baptism, a voice from heaven had said, "Thou art My beloved Son." Now, in the solitude of the wilderness, with only wild beasts for companions, pale and emaciated from a long fast, with the pangs of hunger gnawing at His vitals, will His faith rest on that Word spoken to Him a few days before? Satan seizes the opportunity to insinuate a doubt of the truthfulness of that statement, hoping thereby to cause a failure of the plan of salvation. To doubt would be to disprove His Sonship. If this plan does not carry, Christ may attempt to prove His Sonship by obeying the dictates of Satan, and so take Himself out of the keeping power of God. He feels quite sure that on one or the other of these lines Christ will fail. See "Desire of Ages," p. 119.

5. Satan virtually said to Christ: Now You have assumed to depend on God's Word for support and protection, let me, and all these worshipers in the court below, see God care for You, when You cast Yourself out into space; then all will believe You are the Messiah. Has not God said, He shall give His angels charge over You, to bear You up in their hands, to preserve You from being dashed against the stones? Now trust this part of the Word, if You depend so much on it.

6. Christ does not in this case attempt to argue the matter. That would be to step down on a level with His tormentor. He quietly said, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." It is one thing to trust Him while doing His will, another to try Him while presumptuously taking a course He has not prescribed. God can rescue me from this position, and I still trust Him.

7. These words, spoken by way of command to Satan, when he openly revealed himself, gave him the evidence he pretended to be disinterestedly seeking for. In them was manifested the power which he feigned to doubt was with Christ. The effect of their power was quickly felt by Satan, and he slunk away without another attack upon the Son of God. See "Desire of Ages," p. 130.
