## NOTES

1. The location of Ã†non is not now positively known. It is quite generally conceded to have been west of the Jordan, and some think about eight miles south of Scythopolis. The name itself is merely the Greek rendering of a Chaldee word which signifies "springs." See map.

2. About 925 B.C. Omri, the sixth king of Israel, built the city of Samaria within the tribe of Ephraim, and named it for Shemer, the man of whom he bought the territory. 1 Kings 16:24, 25. It was then made the capital of the ten tribes, and the name of the city was bestowed upon the kingdom itself.

3. "Sychar" is nowhere mentioned in the Bible except in John 4:5. It is quite generally believed to have reference to the important city of Shechem. It lies in a sheltered valley, having Gerizim on the south, and Ebal on the north, and is said to have been the paradise of the Holy Land.
