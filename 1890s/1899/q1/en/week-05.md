## NOTES

1. "At hand;" that is, has come nigh. This was the herald of an expected leader to take them forth from their wanderings in the wilderness of sin. See note 6 of lesson 3. Those to whom the Baptist preached were like their prototypes of old, while in Egypt—outside of God's kingdom, in the service of another king. Therefore the message to them in the wilderness was to be ready to sustain the better administration which was at hand, and so enter the kingdom of heaven.

2. At this time the Roman emperor claimed and exercised the right to appoint and depose the Jewish high priests, as he chose. All who served in this office must please the emperor. Annas, though a sagacious and purchasable man, was not able to hold the office undisturbed. Appointed by Cyrenius, imperial governor of Syria, in A.D. 7 (Luke 2:2), he was obliged to resign at the beginning of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, A.D. 14. He managed, however, to secure the office in turn for five of his sons, and for his son-in-law, Caiaphas, with whom he managed to be associated up to and beyond the time of the crucifixion of Christ. Acts 4:6. See "Desire of Ages," p. 30.

3. Publicans—those holding public office, chiefly tax-gatherers. Doing this work under appointment of, and in the interest of, the Roman Government, this class was odious and despised in the eyes of their countrymen, not only as traitors, but extortioners of large profits out of the national degradation. They received, like all the others, an answer just suited to their needs.
