## NOTE

THE ordinances of divine service that were connected with the first covenant, had no efficacy whatever. They could not make the comer thereunto perfect as pertaining to the conscience. All transgressions committed under that covenant, that were pardoned, were pardoned by virtue of the second covenant, of which Christ is mediator. Yet although Christ's blood was not shed until hundreds of years after the first covenant was made, sins were forgiven whenever they were confessed. That covenant, as we have seen, was for the purpose of directing the minds of the people to the Abrahamic covenant, which God confirmed in Christ. Gal. 3:17. This confirmation was by an oath, in addition to the promise. These "two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie," made the sacrifice of Christ as efficacious in the days of Abraham and Moses as it is now. This is made still more evident by the statement that these two things given to Abraham are the things which give us strong consolation.
