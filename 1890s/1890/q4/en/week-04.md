## NOTE

"FROM him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath." That is, that which he has had intrusted to him, and which he only seems to have. A man may cut quite a figure on borrowed capital; he may spend money lavishly, and get the reputation of being "a good fellow;" but when the time of reckoning comes, and the lender calls for his money, and it is found he has not a penny besides that which he borrowed, all that he has is taken away. He didn't really own anything; he only seemed to. Now God says to us, "What hast thou that thou didst not receive?" 1 Cor. 4:7. All the talents, whether of money, influence, or intellect, with which we may be endowed, and for which people often give us credit, and of which there is such a tendency to boast, are only given us in trust, by the Lord. If we improve them, then at the last it will be found that we have something; but if we make no proper use of them, then in the day of reckoning all our possessions will be taken from us, and it will be seen that we didn't really have anything, but only seemed to.
