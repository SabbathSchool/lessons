## NOTES

1. THE fact that Israel was defeated notwithstanding the presence of the ark of God, is designed to show that the truth is not to be used as a charm. The possession of a cart load of Bibles will not keep anyone from harm or from the assault of the enemy of souls. It is only when the truth is hidden in the heart, and is a part of the life, that it acts as a shield, to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy.

2. A MOST striking point against the vanity of idols is made in the description of the downfall of Dagon before the ark. Dagon was an idol with the body of a fish, and the head and hands of a man. When the idol fell before the ark and lost his head and his hands, only the fishy portion remained. The record says that "only Dagon was left to him." Now the word "Dagon" is the diminutive of the Hebrew word for fish, so that we have in reality the statement that when Dagon fell before the ark and lost his head and his hands, "only a little fish was left." That is all that there was to the idol in which the Philistines trusted.
