## NOTES

1. "THE word of the Lord was precious in those days." That which is rare is precious. The word of the Lord to the people in those days was very rare; it was seldom heard, because there was "no open vision," literally, no vision spread abroad. There were doubtless many who would have been glad to receive the word of the Lord, but they were deprived of it by the wickedness of those in high position. Doubtless the fact that the word of God was so rare in those days made it doubly dear to those who had it.

2. "WHO hold the truth in unrighteousness." The word "hold" is not used in this case in the sense of professing. The text does not convey the idea that men may possess the truth and cling to it, and yet live unrighteous lives; for the Scripture testimony is abundant to show that men who do not practice a truth soon lose the knowledge of it. The word "hold" is used in the common sense of restrain, keep back; as one holds another, when he restrains him of his liberty. Wicked men, especially if they are in the church, restrain the truth of God. Paul said that the name of God was blasphemed because of the unrighteous deeds of the Jews who made their boast in the law and yet broke it; and he asked the brethren to pray that the word might have free course. The sons of Eli by their wickedness held back the word of God from the people.

3. "IF any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine." This evidently does not mean that if a man does the will of God he shall know of the doctrine, for he couldn't do the will of God unless he knew the doctrine. The meaning is that if anyone is disposed to do the will of God, he will not be left in ignorance. The Revised Version makes it plain by rendering the text, "If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching."

4. THE law and the testimony, which is the spirit of prophecy, are closely and inseparably joined. Each upholds the other. If anyone is disposed to do the will of God, the word of God will be revealed to him; and by the light of the word given through the prophets, he knows better what God's will is, and how to do it. The perfect gospel is contained in the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
