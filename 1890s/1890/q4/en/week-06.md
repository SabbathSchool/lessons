## NOTES

1. "Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial." The word "belial" (accent on the first syllable) is capitalized in the translation of the Old Testament, as though it were a proper name, and is doubtless commonly thought to be an appellative of Satan. But it is really only a common noun, a compound of two Hebrew words, and means worthlessness. The sons of Eli would be spoken of in these days as good-for-nothing fellows.

2. "Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children." Literally, thou shalt whet or sharpen them into thy children. The idea is that the truths should be presented to the children in so pointed a manner that they will find an entrance, and that the minds of the children must be sharpened by continual contact with the truth of God.
