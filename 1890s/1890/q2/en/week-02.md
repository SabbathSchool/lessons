## NOTES

This lesson should be considered in connection with the preceding one. After going through with this, a general view of the subject should be taken, from the beginning of the preceding lesson, observing the fact that judgment is never visited upon a person unless he has brought it upon himself, and that in the midst of wrath God remembers mercy.

"God is love." This attribute is inseparable from his character. His law, which is the transcript of his character, is a law of love, and it was given in love. Deut. 33:1-3. The love of God is a living, moving rock of adamant. Those who despise it and oppose it are crushed by it, while those who place themselves upon it, find it a sure and safe refuge from all evil. Government exists for the benefit of the subjects. Those who would impeach God's love and kindness, because he punishes rebels, would have him ignore the loyal subjects, and administer his government with reference solely to the benefit of rebels. Rebellion sets government at defiance, and endangers the welfare of those who are loyal. When men despise God and his law, and also his mercy, they declare themselves not his subjects, and it is but a manifestation of his love to those who trust him when God removes the dangerous element from his kingdom. How much better to place ourselves in the hands of God than to fall into them in a vain attempt to escape from him!
