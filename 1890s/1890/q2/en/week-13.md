## NOTES

"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle." The reference is undoubtedly to the feeding upon Christ, which is both the privilege and the duty of every Christian. See John 6:51-57. But the text must not be understood as implying that Christ is the altar. The priests in the earthly sanctuary did not eat the altar, but they ate the flesh of victims offered upon it. Christ is not the altar, but the Lamb slain. Of him we eat.

The apostle seems in these verses to still continue the contrast between the two covenants as shown by the differences of the sacrifices connected with them. He shows that it was not an arbitrary thing that the bodies of those beasts whose blood was brought into the sanctuary, were burned outside of the camp. That was a type of Christ's suffering outside of the camp, or outside of the city of Jerusalem. The significance of this would seem to be that salvation was not confined to those within the camp, but that the sacrifice is for all,â€”that he should die, "not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad." John 11:52. Our going forth without the gate, bearing his reproach, is the confession that we are here strangers and sojourners, seeking an abiding city yet to come.
