## NOTES

"By it the elders obtained a good report." The word "elders" does not in this instance refer to a particular office, but to those who lived "in that elder day," in the olden time—the ancients. This is shown by the citations which follow, all taken from the men of old.

The Revised Version says that they "have witness borne to them." This is an exact rendering of the Greek. What this good report or witness was is shown especially in verses four and five. Abel obtained witness that he was righteous, and Enoch obtained the testimony that he pleased God.

"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." There is no other way by which we can know anything about creation; for reason cannot grasp the idea of something brought from nothing. So-called scientific speculation concerning the origin of things always proceeds on the basis of something already existing, from which other things were evolved. How the first matter came into existence science cannot tell. Therefore since reason cannot settle the method by which the worlds came into existence, the most reasonable thing to do is to accept the inspired declaration that it was by the word of God. And this lies at the very foundation of faith. If we believe that God created the universe from nothing, we can believe that he has power to make something to his own glory out of us, who are "less than nothing and vanity." And so, in a discourse upon faith, it is eminently fitting that the power of God as manifested in creation should be the starting-point.

Dr. Macknight has the following thoughtful comment on Heb. 11:3:—

"The account of the origin of things given by revelation, is very different from the cosmogony of the heathen philosophers, who generally held that the matter of which the worlds are composed is uncreated and eternal; consequently, being independent of God, and not obedient to his will, they supposed it to be the occasion of all the evil that is in the world. But revelation, which teaches us that the things which are seen were not made of the matter which did appear before they were made, but of matter which God then brought into existence, by thus establishing the sovereignty of God over matter, hath enlarged our ideas of his power, and strengthened our faith in his promises concerning the felicity of good men in the life to come. For the creation of the new heavens and the new earth, and the glories of the city of the living God, do not to their formation require more power than the creation of the present universe; and therefore if we believe that the worlds were framed by the word of God from nothing, every other exercise of faith will be easy for us."

Notice the completeness and the simplicity of the apostle's argument to prove his statement that Enoch was translated by faith. He was translated because he pleased God. He walked with God. But without faith it is impossible to please God. Therefore since Enoch did please God, and was translated in consequence, it follows that he was translated through faith.

"He that cometh to God must believe that he is." To believe that God is, we must believe that he is just what the Bible says he is. If we have any notions of our own concerning God, then the god whom we worship is not the true God, but a god of our making. To believe that God is just what he is, as he has revealed himself to us in nature and revelation, is the very foundation of faith. He who thinks of God as he is, who has a just conception of his power, his glory, and his love, cannot help having faith. Therefore "acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace;" for "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
