3. What encouragement is given for our patient continuance? Heb. 10:37.

There cannot be anything that can add strength to the simple word of God. Macknight well says: "Faith answers all the purposes of a demonstration, because, being founded on the veracity and power of God, these perfections are to the believer complete evidence of the things which God declares have happened, or are to happen, however much they may be out of the ordinary course of nature."

17. What was it that enabled him to obey the command of Christ, to stretch forth his hand? Ans.—Simple faith in the promise of God.
18. Cite another instance in which the evidence is plain that it was simple faith that brought healing. Luke 8:43-48.
19. For what purpose are the miracles of Jesus recorded? John 20:30, 31.

## NOTES

The writer of Hebrews in chapter 10:37, 38 quotes from Hab. 2:3, 4, who is speaking prophetically to the people living in the last days. The book of Hebrews, like a great part of the Bible, was written not simply to those who lived in the writer's day, but for all time until Christ should come. Prophecy is given as a light "until the day dawn." 2 Peter 1:19. While the practical teaching connected therewith would be always applicable, the entire scope of the prophecy would only be met when that generation was reached to which it applied, and whose dangers, needs, and experiences accorded with the warnings and predictions. The book of Hebrews is of especial interest to those living in the last days. In the light which shines upon the sanctuary question, it can now be understood and appreciated; and to the people who understand this it is true that "in a little while he that shall come will come and will not tarry." That Paul did not believe that Christ's coming was imminent in his day is shown by 2 Thess. 2:1-3, and yet he speaks in the first epistle as though it was near at hand. See 1 Thess. 1:10; 4:13-17; 5:23. Those who were instructed as to the times and seasons, who heeded the prophetic portion of the word of God and the apostolic injunction, would not be deceived in this respect. Again, the same God who gave that word still lives, and his faithful servants, of whom there have always been some, always have and will bring forth the "meat in due season" to the household of faith. Matt. 13:52; 24:45. When the time comes that the word is due, God will see that it is given.

"Now the just shall live by faith." Some have erroneously read this as though the first word were the most prominent in the sentence, and that the apostle refers to some special time when the just shall live by faith. The word from which "now" is rendered in this instance is not an adverb at all, and is never used with any reference whatever to time. It is a conjunctive participle, having the force of moreover, nevertheless, besides, etc. It is often used, as in this instance, to introduce an additional thought. Such expressions are very common in the English. For an instance, see Ex. 16:36. Since the days of Adam there has not been a time when the just could live in any other way than by faith.

Faith requires no evidence but the simple promise of God. Its confidence in God is such that it grasps the promises and makes them real. Knowing that nothing is too hard for the Lord, and that he cannot lie, it cannot do anything else but believe, as Chrysostom says, "Since what God giveth transcends reason entirely, it is but reason that we have faith." God promises forgiveness of sins to those who believe. If we believe, our sins are forgiven; if we do not, they are not. Thus it is faith that takes the promises of God, and transforms them into facts.
