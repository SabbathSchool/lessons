## NOTES

In studying the tenth chapter of Hebrews we shall better keep the thread of the apostle's discourse if we consider verses 26-31 as parenthetical, and connect verse 32 with verse 25. The apostle urges the Hebrews, and us as well, to be diligent in attending the assemblies of the saints, and not to forsake them and turn back, but rather to call to remembrance their former experience, when their afflictions and persecutions proved to them the power of Christ and the reality of the gospel. Verses 26-31 are thrown in after the exhortation in verse 25, to show the terrible results of apostasy.

The teacher and pupil may extend the study of the subject of confidence at their pleasure. They will find themselves well repaid for their time. Few professed Christians realize the necessity of confidence; of knowing whom they have believed. 2 Tim. 1:12. Some people seem to think that it is a virtue—a sign of humility—to doubt their acceptance with God, and to talk about the difficulties in the way. They think that it would savor of presumption to say that they can overcome and have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of God. Let such learn a lesson from the twelve spies. The unbelieving ones, who said, "We be not able to go up against the people," did not go up; but the two who said, "We are well able to overcome it," did go up. It was not presumption in Caleb and Joshua to talk as they did, but it was faith in God. All were rewarded according to their faith, or the absence of it. The soul whose trust is wholly in God cannot have too strong confidence.

"The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to its foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no, never, no, never, forsake."
