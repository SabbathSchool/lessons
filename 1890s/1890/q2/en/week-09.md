## NOTE

"Out of weakness were made strong." There is no expression in the Bible that contains more of encouragement than this. It brings us face to face with the wonderful power of God. In this we see the importance of meditating upon the Lord's creative power, as an aid to faith. God could make the universe from nothing. So great is his power that he takes "things which are not, to bring to naught things that are." 1 Cor. 1:27, 28. Our very weakness may in his hands become the source of our greatest strength. The fiercest persecutor of the church became the greatest apostle. Thus, instead of spending time bewailing our weakness, let us commit the keeping of our souls to God, as unto a faithful Creator (1 Peter 4:19), knowing that in his hands our weakness will be transformed into "all might, according to his glorious power."
