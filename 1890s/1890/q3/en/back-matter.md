# Sabbath-School Worker.

A sixteen-page monthly journal, devoted to the interests of the Sabbath-school work, published by -
The International Sabbath-School Association, Oakland, Cal.

At the beginning of the present volume the WORKER was changed from a quarterly to a monthly journal, and its scope greatly enlarged. In addition to general articles upon the various phases of the Sabbath-school work, the following departments will be kept up:—

SPECIAL MENTION.—This department of the WORKER is conducted by the Executive Committee of the International Association, and will contain information concerning the progress of the work in different parts of the field, as well as valuable suggestions in regard to the best methods to be employed in carrying it on.

TALKS WITH CORRESPONDENTS.—Under this heading will appear extracts from letters of general interest, answers to questions, and suggestions in regard to the manner of organizing and conducting a Sabbath-school, etc. It is hoped that those in perplexity in regard to any branch of the work will communicate with the editors of the WORKER. All such letters will be answered in this department of the WORKER, or privately, as may be thought best.

HINTS TO PRIMARY TEACHERS.—As the heading would indicate, this department will be devoted especially to the interests of those working with the children, but teachers in every grade will find valuable suggestions which, if put into practice, will be a great help to them in their work. This department is in charge of one who has had long experience in the work, and therefore the suggestions offered will be of a practical nature.

OUR MISSION FIELD.—This department will be one of special interest to all. It will contain articles on different missions and missionary enterprises, giving special attention to those to which our Sabbath-school contributions have been or are soon to be devoted. Some of the articles will be followed by questions for the benefit of those who wish to make use of them in Sabbath-school work.

In addition to the above the tabulated quarterly reports from all our Sabbath-schools will appear each quarter.

PRICE PER YEAR, POST-PAID, 50 CENTS.

Address all orders to
SABBATH-SCHOOL WORKER,
Oakland, California,
Or to the Secretary of your State Sabbath-school Association.

# THE ILLUSTRATED YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIBRARY

## IS DESIGNED TO FURNISH

# Good, Wholesome Reading Matter for the Young.

TRASHY LITERATURE is often read because the attention has not been directed to something better. The children will read something, and how much better, to have their tastes cultivated so that they will desire to read books of an elevating character. Such reading matter will be furnished from month to month in the Young People's Library, and we confidently appeal to parents to aid us in this enterprise.

Every volume is read and criticised by a large Editorial Committee, and we can promise that the issues of this LIBRARY will be free from objectionable matter. A wide range of subjects will be covered, including History, Biography, Travel, etc. Future issues will embrace the following:—

"Conquering Difficulties."  
"Savonarola, the Florentine Martyr."  
"Life of Eld. J. G. Matteson."  
"Studies in Astronomy."  
"Life on the Congo."  
"Life of Huss."  

Each number will be illustrated, will contain about 160 pages, and will be complete in itself. There will be two styles of binding—paper and cloth.
