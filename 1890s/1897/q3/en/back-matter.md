# THOUGHTS From the MOUNT of BLESSING

This book can not be too highly recommended for its high moral tone and beauty of style. Its 201 pages are filled with the most interesting word-pictures of the principles and truths uttered by our Lord in his memorable Sermon on the Mount. Richly illustrated and bound in cloth at 75c, and half calf at $1.00.

As an indication of the attitude of the religious press toward this book, we subjoin the following notices:

**Free Methodist.**—Its entire trend indicates the author's confidence in the words of Christ. "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." While those words were first addressed to a cosmopolitan gathering centuries ago, they are applicable to all time, and come to us still freighted with that same "spirit" and that same "life."

**Western Christian Advocate.**—A very devout, thoughtful exposition of the Lord Christ's words.

**Christian Observer.**—Very pleasant is the style of this book, and very helpful are its comments on the Sermon on the Mount.

**Baptist Union.**—It can by no means be read with profit at one sitting, but is a book for time of meditation, as its title implies.

**Southern Churchman.**—A deeply religious book.... The publishers have gotten it out, both in type and illustrations, very well indeed.

**Herald and Presbyter.**—This is a book of faith and devotion. Far from being a mere lecture on outward morality, it takes hold of the very inner being, and insists on a life believing and following the Master in simplicity and consecration.

**The Lutheran Observer.**—This is a devotional exposition of Christ's Sermon on the Mount, in which the spiritual riches of the Beatitudes are unfolded in earnest and fervid thoughts.... It is finely illustrated with views of sacred scenes, and is issued by the publishers in handsome style.

**Christian Evangelist**—This volume, dealing with things of the Spirit, is a book for the quiet hour.... It will be found an enlightening and uplifting treatment of these lofty themes.

**Cumberland Presbyterian.**—Is a book of deep, devotional nature, taking hold of the inner being. It has much beauty of style, many apt illustrations, and insists on a life of purity and consecration.
