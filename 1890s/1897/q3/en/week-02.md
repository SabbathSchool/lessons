### ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Note that the Spirit of God comes in fullness and power where there is unity. By what is the Spirit grieved away?
2. Is there in this lesson any instruction as to how to "reach the masses," and to get crowds to listen to preaching? Can we use the Spirit to this end, or must the Spirit use us?
3. With this lesson compare Ephesians 5:18, 19. What special significance is there in the admonition not to be filled with wine, but to be filled with the Spirit?
4. What time does the Scripture say the Spirit was to be poured out as fulfilled at Pentecost? In what days must we, therefore, be living?
5. The Spirit of God is poured out on "all flesh"; why, then, are not the fruits of the Spirit seen in all? See Acts 7:51. So with the gifts of the Spirit. In the apostolic church, the Lord confirmed the word with signs following. See Mark 16:17-20. But when the church departed from the Word, then the signs departed from the church.
