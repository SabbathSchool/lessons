### ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. In what scripture do we find the words, "All they that hate Me, love death"? How is this strikingly illustrated in this lesson?
2. By what power was the lame man made to walk? Did he have anything to do with giving himself strength, save to accept the gift in faith? Who, then, was his strength? and by what power did he walk? Did the fact that Christ was his strength, and that it was Christ's power in him that made him walk, make it unnecessary for him to use his legs? What lesson may we learn from this?
3. "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." Romans 10:10. How does this lesson show that faith has power to produce actual righteousness?
4. Note what a striking comment this lesson is upon the reality of Isaiah 40:29.
5. Does the lack of money prevent God's true children from supplying the wants of the needy? Compare Acts 3:6 with Matthew 10:7-9.
