### NOTE

It will be observed that Stephen abruptly closes his recital of Jewish history and experience, with a reference to the tabernacle and temple and the lesson drawn from them, found in verses 44-50. The sudden change in the subject, and the language used, show that he discerned the fact that they were convicted of the truth, but were resisting the Spirit and rejecting the light which was shining upon them. See verses 51-53.
