### NOTES

1. "Golgotha" is a Hebrew word which signifies the place of a skull. The original Greek word in Luke 23:33 means a skull, and the Latin word "Calvary" signifies a skull or place of skulls. It is not known positively why this name was given to the place. Some have thought it was because the hill resembled a human skull in shape; others think it was so called because it was a place for the execution of criminals.

2. "Pilate then wrote an inscription in three different languages, and placed it upon the cross, above the head of Jesus. It ran thus: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.' This inscription, placed so conspicuously upon the cross, irritated the Jews. In Pilate's court they had cried, 'Crucify Him! We have no king but Caesar!' They declared that whoever claimed other than Caesar for a king was a traitor. But they had overreached themselves in disclaiming any desire to have a king of their own nation. Pilate, in this inscription, wrote out the sentiments which they had expressed. It was a virtual declaration, and so understood by all, that the Jews acknowledged that, on account of their allegiance to the Roman power, any man who aspired to be king of the Jews, however innocent in other respects, should be judged by them worthy of death. There was no other offense named in the inscription; it simply stated that Jesus was the king of the Jews."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 155.

3. "The eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude that had collected together to witness His death, and He saw at the foot of the cross, John supporting Mary, the mother of Christ. . . . He looked upon the grief-stricken face of His mother, and then upon John. Said He, addressing the former, 'Woman, behold thy son!' then to the disciple, 'Behold thy mother!' John well understood the words of Jesus, and the sacred trust which was committed to him. He immediately removed the mother of Christ from the fearful scene of Calvary. From that hour he cared for her as would a dutiful son, taking her to his own home. O pitiful, loving Saviour! Amid all His physical pain, and mental anguish, He had a tender, thoughtful care for the mother who had borne Him. He had no money to leave her by which to insure her future comfort, but He was enshrined in the heart of John, and He gave His mother unto the beloved disciple as a sacred legacy. . . . The followers of Christ should feel that it is a part of their religion to respect and provide for their parents. No pretext of religious devotion can excuse a son or daughter from fulfilling the obligations due to a parent."—Id., pp. 160, 161.

4. "Jesus did not yield up His life till He had accomplished the work which He came to do; and He exclaimed with His parting breath, 'It is finished!' Angels rejoiced as the words were uttered; for the great plan of redemption was being triumphantly carried out. There was joy in heaven that the sons of Adam could now, through a life of obedience, be exalted finally to the presence of God. Satan was defeated, and knew that his kingdom was lost."—Id., pp. 167, 168.

5. "The consent of the governor having been obtained, the legs of the two that were crucified with Jesus were broken, to hasten their death; but Jesus was already dead, and they broke not His legs. The rude soldiers who had witnessed the looks and words of Jesus upon His way to Calvary, and while dying upon the cross, were softened by what they had witnessed, and were restrained from marring Him by breaking His limbs. Thus was prophecy fulfilled, which declared that a bone of Him should not be broken; and the law of the Passover, requiring the sacrifice to be perfect and whole, was also fulfilled in the offering of the Lamb of God: 'They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any bone of it; according to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it,'"—Id., pp. 171, 172.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. Has the seamless coat of Jesus any spiritual significance?
2. How did Jesus know "all things were accomplished"? and how did He know it was necessary for Him to say, "I thirst" in order "that the Scripture might be fulfilled"? (See article on first page of October, 1896, Sabbath School Worker.)
3. Why was John so particular to mention the fact that water and blood flowed from the Saviour's side when it was pierced?
4. What caused the death of Jesus—the nails, the spear-thrust, or some other "wound"?
