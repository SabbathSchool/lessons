### NOTES

1. "He [Jesus] stood in advance of His disciples, and inquired, 'Whom seek ye?' They answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus replied, 'I am He.' As these words were uttered, the mob staggered back; and the priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, dropped powerless to the ground. This gave Jesus ample opportunity to escape from them if He had chosen to do so. But He stood as one glorified amid that coarse and hardened band. When Jesus answered, 'I am He,' the angel who had lately ministered unto Him moved between Him and the murderous mob, who saw a divine light illuminating the Saviour's face, and a dove-like form overshadowing Him. Their wicked hearts were filled with terror. They could not for a moment stand upon their feet in the presence of this divine glory, and they fell as dead men to the ground. . . .

"When the angel departed, the Roman soldiers started to their feet, and with the priests and Judas, gathered about Christ, as though ashamed of their weakness, and fearful that He would yet escape from their hands. Again the question was asked by the Redeemer, 'Whom seek ye?' Again they answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' The Saviour then said, 'I have told you that I am He. If, therefore, ye seek Me, let these go their way'—pointing to the disciples. In this hour of humiliation, Christ's thoughts were not for Himself, but for His beloved disciples. He wished to save them from any farther trial of their strength."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 102, 103.

2. "Band," "captain," and "officers." Josephus says that at the festival of the Passover, when a great multitude of people came to observe the feast, lest there should be any disorder, a band of men was commanded to keep watch at the porches of the temple, to repress a tumult if any should be excited. This band, or guard, was at the disposal of the chief priests. See Matt. 27:65. It was composed of Roman soldiers, and was stationed chiefly at the tower of Antonia, at the northwest side of the temple. In addition to this, they had constant guards stationed around the temple, composed of Levites. "The captain and officers of the Jews" probably referred to those who had charge of the temple guard.

3. Jesus was brought before Annas first because he was probably regarded by the Jews as the legitimate high priest, according to their customs. He was deposed by Valerius Gratus, and after several changes, Caiaphas, his son-in-law, was chosen. See Alford's Notes on Luke 3:2. By reference to that scripture it will be seen that both were counted as high priests at the time John the Baptist began his ministry.

4. "The coldest hour of the night was that preceding the dawn, and a fire had been lighted in the hall. Around this a company were gathered; and Peter presumptuously took his place with the rest by the fire, and stood warming himself. He did not wish to be recognized as one of the disciples of Jesus, and he thought by mingling carelessly with the people he would be taken for one of those who had brought Jesus to the hall."

"Many who do not hesitate to engage in active warfare for the Lord, are driven to deny their faith through the ridicule of their enemies. They place themselves in the way of temptation by associating with those whom they should avoid. They thus invite the enemy to tempt them, and are led to do and say that which they would never have been guilty of under other circumstances. The disciple of Christ who in our day disguises his faith through dread of suffering or reproach, denies his Lord as virtually as did Peter in the judgment-hall. There are always those who boast of their freedom of thought and action, and laugh at the scruples of the conscientious who fear to do wrong. Yet if those righteous persons are persuaded to yield their faith, they are despised by the very ones who were Satan's agents to tempt them to their ruin."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 107, 108, 112, 113.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. How did Jesus know all things that should come upon Him?
2. Compare verse 8 with John 10:11, 12. How do the Shepherd's words and the facts compare?
3. What lesson may we draw from verse 11, with reference to Church and State, and also as to our conduct when assailed with carnal weapons?
4. If we begin to follow Peter's example (verse 10), is there not danger of continuing in the course he pursued that night?
