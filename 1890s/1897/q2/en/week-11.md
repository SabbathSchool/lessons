### NOTES

1. "John was at a loss to know what measures he should take in regard to the body of his beloved Master. . . . But Joseph and Nicodemus came to the front in this emergency. Both of these men were members of the Sanhedrin, and acquainted with Pilate. Both were men of wealth and influence." "Neither of these men had openly attached himself to the Saviour while He was living, although both believed on Him. They knew that if they declared their faith they would be excluded from the Sanhedrin council, on account of the prejudice of the priests and elders toward Jesus. This would have cut them off from all power to aid or protect Him by using their influence in the council. Several times they had shown the fallacy of the grounds of His condemnation, and protested against His arrest, and the council had broken up without accomplishing that for which it had been called together; for it was impossible to procure the condemnation of Jesus without the unanimous consent of the Sanhedrin. The object of the priests had finally been obtained by calling a secret counsel, to which Joseph and Nicodemus were not summoned.

"The two councilors now came boldly forth to the aid of the disciples. The help of these rich and honored men was greatly needed at that time. They could do for the slain Saviour what it was impossible for the poorer disciples to do; and their influential positions protected them in a great measure from censure and remonstrance."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 173, 175.

2. Embalming among the Jews consisted mainly in wrapping the body in many folds of linen with a profusion of aromatic spices—myrrh, aloes, etc.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. Was it an ordinary request which Joseph made in asking for the body of Jesus?
2. Who first announced that Jesus had risen? Are there any other instances where woman has led out in God's work?
3. In connection with such an event, and amid such exciting scenes, why is such pains taken to describe the position of a napkin?
4. Why did the disciples not know the Scripture that He must rise again from the dead? Is there any lesson here for us?
