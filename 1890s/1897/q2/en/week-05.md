### NOTES

1. In verse 2 we learn that Christ was given power or authority to give eternal life to as many as the Father had given Him. By comparing this verse with verses 6-12 we learn who were given to Him, namely, those who keep God's word. See verse 6, last clause. The reason why Judas was lost was because he forsook Jesus, and thus departed from God's word. So when we yield our hearts to God, to keep his word, and do not forsake Jesus, we will be "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time." 1 Peter 1:5.

2. To know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, will make a person a Christian, a true child of God, because he who knows God truly will love and obey Him. By beholding we become changed into the same image. 2 Cor. 3:18. Our love for God will be in proportion to our acquaintance with Him. Hence, eternal life is sure to those who know God; for they are connected with the source of life.

3. "In the intercessory prayer of Jesus with His Father, He claimed that He had fulfilled the conditions which made it obligatory upon the Father to fulfil His part of the contract made in heaven with regard to fallen man. He prayed: 'I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. [That is, He had wrought out a righteous character on earth as an example for men to follow.] And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.'"—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 260.

4. "I pray for them." "The blood of Jesus is pleading with power and efficacy for those who are backslidden, for those who are rebellious, for those who sin against great light and love. Satan stands at our right hand to accuse us, and our Advocate stands at God's right hand to plead for us. He has never lost a case that has been committed to Him. We may trust in our Advocate, for He pleads His own merits in our behalf. Hear His prayer before his betrayal and trial, . . . and let every word be engraven upon the tablets of the soul."—Review and Herald, August 15, 1893.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. Why are people destroyed? Compare Hos. 4:6; Isa. 5:13; Jer. 8:7, and John 4:22. What, then, is our mission?
2. Do you also glorify God in the earth? How? See John 15:8.
3. To what did Jesus refer in verse 5, when He prayed the Father to glorify Him with the glory which He (Christ) had with Him before the world was? Compare also with verse 22 in the next lesson.
4. How does the Father respond to the request in verse 11? See Zech. 2:8.
