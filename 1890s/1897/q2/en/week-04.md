### NOTES

1. The experience mentioned in verse 20 evidently refers to the time immediately following Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. Compare with verse 22. From that time and onward they were to ask nothing of Him, but to ask the Father in His name. See verses 23-26. The reason He states in verse 27, where He says, "For the Father Himself loveth you, because ye have loved Me, and have believed that I came out from God." In this instruction we see how wisely and effectually Jesus sought to reveal the character of God, and direct the minds of His disciples to His Father as the source of all good, by teaching them to pray to the Father in His name.

2. The world may hate us and harass us and cause us tribulation and sorrow, but in Jesus there are rest and peace. This peace comes from harmony with God, and the assurance that as Christ has overcome the world, its trials, its troubles, its temptations, and all the power of the enemy, so He will give us power to do the same, to overcome as He overcame. Therefore we are to be of good cheer; victory is sure; deliverance will come.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. What do you think is implied in our Saviour's statement, "Ye shall see Me, because I go to the Father"? Compare John 14:2; Rev. 21:3.
2. With verses 30-32 read 1 Cor. 10:12; first sentence of 2 Cor. 13:5, and 2 Peter 1:1-12.
3. How can we have tribulation in the world and still have peace in Christ?
