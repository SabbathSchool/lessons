### NOTES

1. "They remembered that at the commencement of His ministry a similar scene had been enacted to that which had just taken place. Jesus had then bade them launch out into the deep, and let down their nets for a draught, and the net had broken because of the amount of fishes taken. Then He bade them leave their nets and follow Him, and He would make them fishers of men. This last miracle that Jesus had just wrought was for the purpose of making the former miracle more impressive; that the disciples might perceive that, notwithstanding they were to be deprived of the personal companionship of their Master, and of the means of sustenance by the pursuit of their favorite employment, yet a resurrected Saviour had a care over them, and would provide for them while they were doing His Work. Jesus also had a purpose in bidding them cast their net upon the right side of the ship. On that side stood Christ upon the shore. If they labored in connection with Him—His divine power uniting with their human effort—they would not fail of success.

"The repetition of the miraculous draught of fishes was a renewal of Christ's commission to His disciples. It showed them that the death of their Master did not remove their obligation to do the work which He had assigned them."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 228, 229.

2. "The disciples expected that Peter would no longer be allowed to occupy the prominent position in the work which he had hitherto held, and he himself had lost his customary self-confidence. But Jesus, while dining by the seaside, singled out Peter, saying, 'Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these?' referring to his brethren. . . . Three times had Peter openly denied his Lord, and three times did Jesus draw from him the assurance of his love and loyalty, by pressing home that pointed question, like a barbed arrow, to his wounded heart. Jesus, before the assembled disciples, brought out the depth of Peter's penitence, and showed how thoroughly humbled was the once boasting disciple. He was now intrusted with the important commission of caring for the flock of Christ. Though every other qualification might be unexceptionable, yet without the love of Christ he could not be a faithful shepherd over the Christian flock."—Id., pp. 229-231.

3. "Jesus here explicitly stated to Peter the fact and manner of his death; He even referred to the stretching forth of his hands upon the cross; and after He had thus spoken, He repeated His former injunction, 'Follow Me.' The disciple was not disconcerted by the revelation of his Master. He felt willing to suffer any death for his Lord. Peter saw that John was following, and a desire came over him to know his future, and he 'saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me.' Peter should have considered that his Lord would reveal to him all that it was best for him to know, without inquiry on his part. It is the duty of every one to follow Christ, without undue anxiety as to the duty assigned to others. In saying of John, 'If I will that he tarry till I come,' Jesus gave no assurance that this disciple should live until the second coming of Christ; He merely asserted His own supreme power, and that even if He should will this to be so, it would in no way affect the work of Peter. The future of both John and Peter was in the hands of the Lord, and obedience in following Him was the duty required of each."—Id., pp. 232, 233.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

2. To how many who love Jesus does He address the command, Feed My lambs; feed My sheep?
3. According to verse 22, who am I to watch?
4. What help have you received personally from the study of the lessons on the Gospel by John?

### "FEED MY SHEEP"

```
Ere the sun had kissed the ripples
   Of a far-off eastern sea,
On its shore the night-long fishers
   Saw the Man of Calvary.
He had borne the taunts and jeering,
   Borne the cross and thorny crown,
Borne the angry oaths and mockings,
   Borne the sins that crushed Him down.

                    Now the grave had opened for Him;
                       All death's shackles shattered lay;
                     Stood He there the Godhead emblem
                       Of the resurrection day.
                     Loved disciples gathered round Him,
                       Listening to each word that fell,
                     Glad for e'en a broken whisper
                       From the lips they loved so well.

"In the courts of highest heaven,
    Glories, riches, and renown,
   All were given—freely given;
     In the grave I laid them down.
   Now My hungry flock is straying
     O'er the mountains wild and steep.
   Tell Me, Peter, dost thou love Me?"
     "Yea, Thou knowest." "Feed My sheep.

                   "Feed them with the bread I give thee
                        Feed them with a tender care;
                      Call upon Me in thy trouble,
                        I will hear—I'll meet thee there.
                      Feed them not on honeyed fables,
                        Earthly pleasures, husks, and shams;
                      I have ransomed e'en the weakest.
                        Dost thou love Me? Feed My lambs."
