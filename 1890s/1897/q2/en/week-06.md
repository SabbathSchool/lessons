### NOTES

1. "It is the will of God that union and brotherly love should exist among His people. The prayer of Christ just before His crucifixion was that His disciples might be one as He is one with the Father, that the world might believe that God had sent Him. This most touching and wonderful prayer reaches down the ages, even to our day; for His words were, 'Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.' While we are not to sacrifice one principle of truth, it should be our constant aim to reach this state of unity. This is the evidence of our discipleship. Said Jesus, 'By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 520.

2. "The children of God are those who are partakers of His nature. It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor religious privilege, which proves that we are members of the family of God; it is love,—a love that embraces all humanity. Even sinners, whose hearts are not utterly closed to God's Spirit, will respond to kindness; while they may give hate for hate, they will also give love for love. But it is only the Spirit of God that gives love for hatred. To be kind to the unthankful and to the evil, to do good, hoping for nothing again, is the insignia of the royally of heaven, the sure token by which the children of the Highest reveal their high estate."—Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 75.

3. It is a most encouraging and comforting thought that the Father loves us the same as He loves His only-begotten Son. This is clearly stated in the Saviour's prayer. See verse 23. But this is not all; the same love which God has for His Son and for us,—"the love of God,"—is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5) if we are true believers, and Jesus reveals the Father to us that this experience may be ours (Rom. 5:1). He says, "And I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them." Verse 26.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. Study Christ's manner of living in this world (see Matt. 8:20; and 10:25), and read again verse 18 of our lesson. Are we content to be as our Master?
2. By what means can the union for which Jesus prayed be secured among God's people?
3. Since God loves me as He loved Christ, and since He loved Him because he "lay down His life for the sheep," what ought to be my attitude toward the sheep? See 1 John 3:16.
