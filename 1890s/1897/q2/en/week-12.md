### NOTES

1. "The same day at evening, being the first day of the week." This was the same day in which the events took place which are narrated in the previous eighteen verses. From this we know that the meeting recorded in verse 19 occurred in the evening following the first day of the week. The following account of the arrival at Jerusalem of the two disciples from Emmaus after Jesus had made Himself known to them, will be of interest to the student:—

"When the disciples arrived at Jerusalem, they entered the eastern gate, which was open on festal occasions. The houses were dark and silent, but they made their way through the narrow streets by the light of the rising moon. They knew that they would find their brethren in the memorable upper chamber where Jesus had spent the last night before His death. . . Cautious hands unbarred the door to the repeated demand of the two travelers; they entered, and with them also entered Jesus, who had been their unseen companion all the way. . .

"When the disciples from Emmaus entered with their joyful tidings, they were met by the exclamation from many voices, 'The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.'"—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 216, 217.

2. "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them." "Jesus, in giving the disciples their first commission, had said, 'I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou [referring to responsible men who should represent His church] shall bind upon earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.' In renewing the commission of those to whom He had imparted the Holy Ghost, He said, 'Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.' These words conveyed to the disciples a sense of the sacredness of their work, and its tremendous results. Imbued with the Spirit of God, they were to go forth, preaching the merits of a sin-pardoning Saviour; and they had the assurance that all Heaven was interested in their labors, and that what they did on earth, in the Spirit and power of Christ, should be ratified in heaven. . . . The Saviour taught that His is the only name given under heaven whereby men shall be saved. Jesus, however, delegated to His church upon earth, in her organized capacity, the power to censure, and to remove censure, according to the rules prescribed by inspiration; but these acts were only to be done by men of good repute, who were consecrated by the great Head of the church, and who showed by their lives that they were earnestly seeking to follow the guidance of the Spirit of God."—Id., pp. 244, 245.

Through the labors of the apostles and God's servants in preaching the Word, people would believe the gospel, and their sins would be remitted, as illustrated on the day of Pentecost. Acts 2:37, 38. The power of God's Word over the people, when proclaimed by God's servants, is also illustrated in the case of Jeremiah. (See Jer. 1:9, 10.)

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. What lesson is there for us in the tarrying of Jesus to meet Mary at the sepulcher?
2. Jesus said to Mary, "Touch Me not" (verse 17), and yet later He permitted His disciples to touch Him (see Matt. 28:9). How do you explain this?
3. In the light of verse 23, Matt. 18:15-18; and Jer. 50:20, is there any importance attached to membership in the church?
