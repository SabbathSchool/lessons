9. What took place when Peter returned to Jerusalem? Who were they who found fault with his course?
10. What was their charge?
11. How did Peter answer them?
12. Give his answer in detail.
13. At what point did he say the Holy Ghost was poured upon the listening Gentiles? In what manner did the Spirit come on them?

## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. What is the great principle taught in this lesson? Cite texts from the epistles setting forth this truth.
2. From what did Peter quote in the beginning of his discourse on Pentecost? How extensively had God by the prophet said that His Spirit would be poured out? If the brethren had remembered this statement, would they have wondered that the Gentiles received the Spirit? Has the lesson taught by the story of Cornelius been fully learned by Christians?
3. Is there any fixed rule as to how and when people shall receive the Spirit? Mention the different instances that we have already studied, and note the circumstances in each case. Do these cases show whether or not the Spirit is given only after baptism, or by the laying on of hands?
4. What was there in the example of Jesus to warrant Peter in what he did? What complaint similar to that brought against Peter was frequently brought against Christ by the Pharisees?
