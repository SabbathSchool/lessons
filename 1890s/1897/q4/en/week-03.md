## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Find other texts which show the nature of Saul's feeling toward the disciples.
2. What can we learn from this narrative as to the way we should regard those who oppose the truth?
3. Against whom is all persecution directed?
4. If this were always remembered by those who suffer for the faith, what effect would it have on them?
5. The student may have noticed that the words contained in the last part of verse 5 and the first half of verse 6 are omitted in the Revised Version. This, however, can at the most signify no more than that these words do not occur in this part of the received Greek text; for if we examine Paul's account in chapter 22, we shall find a portion of the words which are here omitted.
