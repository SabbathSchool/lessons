## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Repeat the verse in the Psalms that is strikingly illustrated in this lesson, and tell where it is found.
2. Who was "Herod the king"? How many Herods are mentioned in the New Testament?
3. How many of the twelve apostles were named James?
4. Note that the Revised Version has "Passover" in verse 4, instead of "Easter." The use of the word "Easter" is really a perversion; the disciples knew nothing either of the word or the festival, unless they had chanced to hear the name of the heathen deity from which it comes.
