# LESSON 13.—March 27, 1897

## A REVIEW LESSON

1. Read carefully the five chapters which have been studied during the present quarter, and make a brief written outline in your own words of the leading topics in each chapter.

2. Observe that Christ is presented in these lessons as:—
   (a) The Good Shepherd.
   (b) The Son of God.
   (c) The Resurrection.
   (d) The Life.
   (e) The King of Israel.
   (f) The Light of the world.
   (g) The Servant of servants.
   (h) The Way.
   (i) The Truth.
   (j) The Comforter (through the Holy Spirit).

3. Study the following great truths as taught in these lessons:—
   (a) The tender care of Jesus for His children.
   (b) The universal character of the gospel message.
   (c) Christ the only Lifegiver.
   (d) The true character of Christ's kingdom.
   (e) Life through death; the law both for Christ and His followers.
   (f) The cross of Christ the safety of the universe.
   (g) The real cause of blindness and hardness.
   (h) A neglected ordinance and the blessing of observing it.
   (i) The true evidence of discipleship.
   (j) The personal second advent.
   (k) God in Christ.
   (l) The Holy Spirit Christ's representative.
   (m) Love shows itself in obedience.
   (n) True peace for believers.

4. In these chapters Christ finishes His work and His teaching among His enemies, and begins His last teaching in the inner circle of His immediate friends. Note the contrast between the triumphal entry and the washing of the disciples' feet. Are the same principles of His character revealed in both instances?

5. Count the number of places and note the different ways in which life through Christ is taught in these chapters. This gospel is indeed the gospel of life.

6. Would it not be profitable for each one to consider whether he has received personal benefit from the study of these lessons? A clearer knowledge of Christ, and as a consequence, advancement in the Christian life, should be the object of all Bible study. Has this been realized?
