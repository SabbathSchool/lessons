### NOTES

1. The instruction given to His disciples by Jesus on that last night before His crucifixion has been the comfort of believers in all ages. He began with, "Let not your heart be troubled," and the discourse "flows on in one channel of love, and ends at last with the word, 'Be of good cheer.'" We are to be of good cheer while in the world, because He has overcome it, and we are not to be troubled, for He is coming again.

2. "Of what coming again does the Lord here speak?—The same of which He spoke in Matt. 24:30-31, His glorious return at the last day to 'gather His elect,' Acts 1:11. Visibly He departs, visibly will He return; and there He will receive His people to Himself into His heavenly kingdom." The comfort which Jesus offers to the believer is not, "You will soon die and come to me," but, "I will come again." "One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ's second coming, to complete the great work of redemption.... The doctrine of the second advent is the very key-note of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised One to break the destroyer's power and bring them again to the lost Paradise.... About His coming cluster the glories of that 'restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.' Then the long-continued rule of evil shall be broken; 'the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ; and He shall reign forever and ever.' It is then that the peaceful and long-desired kingdom of the Messiah shall be established under the whole heaven." "The more of heaven we have here below, through the outpouring of the Spirit, the more rapturous become our anticipations of the glory that is to come."

3. "Jesus says: 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.' I am that ladder which Jacob saw, the base of it resting firmly upon the earth, while the topmost round reaches to the throne of God. I am the light that shines upon every soul who climbs up by Me. I am the life, inspiring with faith and love as you move onward and upward.' All truth is found in Christ.... Only by presenting the truth as it is in Jesus, will our work be effectual in reaching the hearts of men."

4. "I am the way." It is not a cold, dead road we have to make the most of for ourselves, pursuing it often in darkness, in weakness, in fear. It is a living way—a way that renews our strength as we walk in it, that enlivens instead of exhausting us, that gives direction and light as we go forward.... Wherever you are, at whatever point of experience, at whatever stage of sin, this way begins where you are, and you have but to take it and it leads to God.... From your person, as you are at this moment, there leads a way to the Father." "Just where the sinner is, in that very quagmire, begins the way. Not a single step heavenward can he take until he depends on Christ."

5. "In Christ we behold God.... In Christ blessing little children; joining in the harmless gaiety of the Cana wedding-feast; mourning over Lazarus; allowing the penitent woman to touch Him; showing gentleness, courtesy, consideration, tenderness, to everybody,—we have the manifestation of the unseen Jehovah. Such as Christ is, such is God."

6. "Our Saviour said, 'Greater works than these shall ye do; because I go unto My Father.' What are these 'greater works'? If our lips are touched with the living coal from off the altar, we shall reveal to the world the wonderful love manifested by God in giving Jesus, His only-begotten Son, to the world, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." After the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus, the disciples "saw that the prophecies had been literally fulfilled. They could search the Scriptures and accept their teachings with a faith and assurance which they had never known before. The divine Teacher was indeed all that He claimed to be. The prophecies relating to Christ and His mission were no longer a mystery to His disciples, but a living reality; and as they told their experience to the world, as they exalted the love of God, the divine assurance which they manifested was an evidence to men that they had received the gift of the Holy Ghost. Men's hearts were melted and subdued. The promise, 'Greater works than these shall ye do; because I go unto My Father,' was fulfilled."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. Just now Christ is preparing a people for the place which He has prepared for them. Are we ready for our place?
2. The third verse brings up the whole question of Christ's second coming. This opens an almost boundless field for study. Note especially 1 Thess. 4:16 to 5:6.
3. The central thought of heaven is to be with Christ. Why would a sinner be unhappy in heaven?
4. Study verse 10 as revealing the innermost principle of the Christian life: "The Father abiding in Me doeth His works." Revised Version.
