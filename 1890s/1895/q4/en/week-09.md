## NOTES

1. Faith is the gift of God, but it is ours to exercise. God leaves it optional with us whether we will use the faith He gives. All the powers of earth have not sufficient power to force a single soul to believe anything. If one believes it must be through force of conviction from accepting certain testimony, and not by outward constraint. Faith is voluntary. Its foundation is the word of God (Romans 10:17); but no one can, by force, compel another to believe the Bible (John 7:17).

"Where legal enactment begins, moral suasion ends." — Christian Union.

"You must recollect that you can't make people good or religious by act of Parliament." — Sir George Dibbs, Ex-Premier of New South Wales.

2. "Almighty God hath created the mind free; all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitation, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercion on either, as was in his power to do." — Thomas Jefferson.

3. The views of Luther on the subject of using force in religious work are clearly set forth in the following words:

"It is with the word we must contend, and by the word we must refute and expel what has gained a footing by violence. I would not resort to force against such as are superstitious, nor even against unbelievers. Whosoever believeth let him draw nigh, and whoso believeth not stand afar off. Let there be no compulsion. Liberty is of the very essence of faith."

4. Vengeance, or retributive justice, belongs to God to execute and not to man, because all men are alike accountable to God for their conduct. Therefore we are not to become angry and avenge ourselves for the wrongdoings of others, but we are to "give place unto wrath," that is, God's wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." The Lord's wrath will be visited in harmony with the principles of justice, love, and righteousness. God has not committed to men the work of judging, condemning, and executing vengeance upon anyone. The Papacy has often shown its antichristian character by engaging in such work.

5. Should anyone go to the house of another, and, without knocking, bolt through the door and rush in uninvited, he would be considered rude and unmannerly. Christ does not so. He has too much respect for the rights of every individual to force an entrance through the door of any human heart. He stands without and knocks, and says if any man will hear and open, He will come in. But, ah, how many professing to be followers of Christ have rudely sought by force to break open the door and rule men's hearts by human laws, and compel submission to church dogmas!

6. "The government of God is not as Satan would make it appear, founded upon a blind submission, an unreasoning control. It appeals to the intellect and the conscience. 'Come now, and let us reason together,' is the Creator's invitation to the beings He has made. God does not force the will of His creatures. He cannot accept an homage that is not willingly and intelligently given. A mere forced submission would prevent all development of mind or character; it would make man a mere automaton. Such is not the purpose of the Creator. He desires that man, the crowning work of His creative power, shall reach the highest possible development. He sets before us the height of blessing to which He desires to bring us, through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God." — Steps to Christ, p. 43.
