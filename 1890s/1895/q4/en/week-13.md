## TRUE PROTESTANTISM

### WHEN IT AROSE

1. FROM what does the word "Protestantism" come? — The word "protest."

2. What is the meaning of the word "protest"? — "To affirm in a public or formal manner; to declare solemnly; to make a solemn declaration expressive of opposition." — Webster.

3. When did Protestantism arise? — In the early part of the sixteenth century.

4. Against what did the Protestants protest? — The assumed right of the Church to use the power of the State, and the multitude of abuses growing out of it — against a union of Church and State.

5. In what language did the Christian princes of Germany couch their famous protest? (See note 1.)

6. What did they further say? — "Let us reject this decree. In matters of conscience the majority has no power." — D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation, book 13, chap. 6.

7. What has been truthfully said of this protest? (See note 2.)

### UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES

8. Are these principles in harmony with the course pursued by the apostles and the teachings of Christ? Acts 4:19; 5:29; Matthew 22:21.

9. Is the union of Church and State wrong simply when the Romish Church is united to the State, or is it wrong in principle?

10. Do the same principles inhere and the same evils result when any other church or religion is united to the State? (See note 3.)

11. Have other churches persecuted when they sought and gained control of the power of the State? (See same note.)

12. Therefore, what is it to be a true Protestant? — To protest against the union of Church and State on principle, and the workings of it wherever found.

### WHO ASK AND WHO REFUSE STATE SUPPORT

13. What is a noteworthy fact? — That those who have the truth do not feel the need nor ask for the assistance of State laws in support of the doctrines they preach.

14. Do Baptists ask for a law enforcing baptism, or the Disciples a law enforcing the Lord's Supper, or the Seventh-day Adventists a law enforcing the observance of the seventh day?

15. Why do such not feel the need of State laws in these matters? — Because they find a plain "Thus saith the Lord" in the Bible for all these, and that is sufficient.

16. Who is it, then, that calls for aid of the State? (See note 4.)

17. On which side of the controversy, therefore, do true Protestants naturally stand? — On the side of God's word.

### PROTESTANT APOSTASY

18. What do the Scriptures say in regard to the professed Christian world in the last days? 2 Timothy 3:1-5; Revelation 14:8; 18:1, 2.

19. What position will the Papacy then hold, and how will it be regarded? Revelation 13:3, 8.

20. When Romanism and apostate Protestantism so far unite as to constitute the great Babylon of Revelation 18:1-8, what warning is due? Verse 4.

21. How will Babylon regard her condition then? Revelation 18:7.

22. Why do not the Protestant churches see what the Papacy is aiming at? (See note 5.)

23. What do the people need? (See note 6.)

24. And what is this? — The warning of the Third Angel's Message, the closing work of the "everlasting gospel" to men. Revelation 14:6-10.

## NOTES

1. "We protest by these presents, before God, who will one day be our Judge, as well as before all men and all creatures, that we, for us and for our people, neither consent nor adhere in any manner whatsoever to the proposed decree, in anything that is contrary to God, to his holy word, to our right conscience, to the salvation of our souls, and to the last decree of Spires." "We cannot assert that when Almighty God calls a man to his knowledge, he dare not embrace that divine knowledge." "We reject the yoke that is imposed on us." — D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation, book 13.

2. "One of the noblest testimonies ever uttered for the Reformation was the protest offered by the Christian princes of Germany at the Diet of Spires, in 1529. The courage, faith, and firmness of those men of God gained for succeeding ages liberty of thought and conscience. Their protest gave to the reformed church the name of Protestant; its principles are the very essence of Protestantism." — Great Controversy, p. 197.

3. Whenever Church and State have been united, persecution has resulted, regardless of what church and State were united. The heathen religion united to the Babylonian and Medo-Persian Governments persecuted Daniel and the three Hebrews, and finally planned to destroy God's people entirely by one fell stroke. And thus it has been with the Roman Church, the Greek Church, the English Church, the Scotch Church, and every other church established by law. Canon Potter, English prelate of Melbourne, makes the following admission:

"It is quite true that systematized persecution of religious opinion was no monopoly of the Romish Church. It is a miserable fact that from the fourth to the eighteenth centuries it was the rule everywhere throughout Christendom to inflict the penalties of banishment and fine and death on those who openly differed from the prevailing form of religion. We of the Church of England confess with sorrow that our church has been guilty of persecution, and did wrong to persecute." — Melbourne Argus, May 13, 1895.

4. The men who defend those institutions which are not founded on God's word are the ones who call for State legislation. The lack of divine command is supplied by oppressive enactments.

"God never forces the will or the conscience, but Satan will employ the most cruel measures to control the consciences of men, and to secure worship to himself. And this work of compulsion is always in favor of human creeds and laws, and in defiance of God's holy law." — Great Controversy (old edition), p. 40.

5. "The Protestant churches are in great darkness, or they would discern the signs of the times. The Roman Church is far-reaching in her plans and modes of operation. She is employing every device to extend her influence and increase her power in preparation for a fierce and determined conflict to regain control of the world, to reestablish persecution, and to undo all that Protestantism has done." — Great Controversy, p. 565.

"In the last conflict, the Sabbath will be the special point of controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular rulers and religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of Sunday; and as milder measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be enacted. . . . Romanism in the Old World, and apostate Protestantism in the New, will pursue a similar course toward those who honor the divine precepts." — Great Controversy, old edition, pp. 114, 115.

6. "Men are closing their eyes to the real character of Romanism, and the dangers to be apprehended from her supremacy. The people need to be aroused to resist the advances of this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty." — Great Controversy, p. 566.

"While the Protestant world is by her attitude making concessions to Rome, let us arouse to comprehend the situation, and view the contest before us in its true bearings. Let the watchmen now lift up their voices, and give the message which is present truth for this time. Let us show the people where we are in prophetic history, and seek to arouse the spirit of true Protestantism, awaking the world to a sense of the value of the privileges of religious liberty so long enjoyed." — Testimony 33, p. 240.

## THE TIME'S DEMAND

> "God give us men! A time like this demands  
> Great hearts, strong minds, true faith, and willing hands;  
> Men whom the lust of office does not kill;  
> Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;  
> Men who possess opinions and a will.  
> Men who have honor, men who will not lie;  
> For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,  
> Their large professions and their little deeds,  
> Wrangle in selfish strife—lo! Freedom weeps,  
> Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps."  
> — O. W. Holmes.
