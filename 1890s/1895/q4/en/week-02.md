## NOTES

1. Freedom is a condition desirable to all. Everybody likes to be free—free to think, act, and speak, free to go where he wishes, and do what he pleases. It is an inborn principle. God made man free in the beginning, and it is only sin that has brought bondage and slavery of any kind into the world. The words of Patrick Henry, "Give me liberty, or give me death," are but an outburst of this natural desire for freedom.

2. No man by nature is truly free. All, in consequence of the fall, are slaves; all are subject to things which bring them into bondage—slaves of habits, customs, and traditions, slaves of men, slaves of self, slaves of sin.

3. Men show themselves to be slaves in the following ways:

   (a) They become so addicted to habits which they know are an injury to them, that they cannot break them off. They try to do it again and again, but fail. The habit is master, and they are slaves. This lack of power is thus stated by the apostle: "For what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I." Romans 7:15. "For to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not." Verse 18.

   (b) Many do things for no better reason than because others do them, or because their forefathers did them. They are slaves to custom. This is well illustrated by the history of the Samaritans, recorded in 2 Kings 17:40, 41: "Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children; as did their fathers, so do they unto this day." This is also most strikingly shown in the matter of Sunday observance. The condition of millions in this respect is correctly represented in the following words of Ex-Governor St. John: "I observe Sunday as God's holy Sabbath day. I am frank about it. It always pays a man to be frank. Now, why do I observe Sunday?—I observe Sunday because my father and mother observed it, and not because I have gone down deep and searched the Bible for the truth of the matter."—Speech in Battle Creek, Mich., Sept. 8, 1890.

   (c) Many have not the courage to think. They are afraid to allow themselves to reason, fearing that the conclusion will condemn them. They let others do their thinking for them. But God wants men to use the mental powers He has given them. He, the Author of our minds, says, "Come now, and let us reason together." Isaiah 1:18.

   (d) Others, though allowing themselves to think, have not the courage to give expression to their convictions, fearing it might cost them something to do it. This was the trouble with many in Christ's day. "Howbeit no man spake openly of Him for fear of the Jews." John 7:13. See also John 9:22.

   (e) To go with the majority or the great men when we think they may be going wrong. The Lord says: "Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men." Hosea 10:13. "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil." Exodus 23:2.

   (f) Many shun duty for fear of what men may think or say of them or do to them. Against this the Lord has often warned His people: "Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread." Isaiah 8:12, 13. See also Isaiah 57:12, 13; Matthew 10:28, 32, 33; Psalm 56:4.

   (g) We show our slavery by serving men instead of God. But the Lord teaches that what we do for or in respect to others we are to do "not with eyeservice, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men." Ephesians 6:6, 7.

   (h) Whosoever follows the commandments of men instead of the commandments of God, is the servant of men instead of the servant of God. This is vain worship, because it is man worship. See Matthew 15:9; Isaiah 29:13; Titus 1:14.

   (i) Whoever commits sin is the servant, or slave, of sin, and through sin of the devil, who is the originator and author of sin. John 8:34; Romans 6:16; 1 John 3:8.

4. Though announced in an assumed hypothetical way, Paul does, nevertheless, here express his freedom. He was "free from all men." And his perfect freedom is further shown in the expression which follows, "Yet have I made myself servant unto all." This was voluntary. He made himself servant. Let it be noted, also, that this freedom which Christ gives, though making men free from all men, does not make them unfeeling or ostentatiously independent, but kind-hearted, sympathetic, and willing and ready to do good to all.
