### NOTES

1. In the very nature of things judgment must follow a time of probation. God's judgment of this world must, therefore, come at the close of its history. This is also evident when we remember that the influence of a man's deeds continues after his death, and will continue till the close of probation, when the decree goes forth which is found in Rev. 22:11. His influence will, therefore, be considered in the judgment, because it is a result of his work. Eccl. 12:13, 14.

2. The day of judgment is not to be understood as a day of twenty-four hours. The Scriptures speak of the day of the Lord (Joel 2:1, 11), and the day of salvation (2 Cor. 6:2). These are long periods of time, and the day of judgment which God has appointed involves work that extends over a period of many years, as the Bible plainly teaches.

3. We have already found that the cleansing of the sanctuary is a work of judgment. Hence when the Lord reveals the time when the cleansing of the sanctuary is to take place, he reveals the time when the judgment is to begin.

4. As the angel began on the subject of time when he came to Daniel to explain the vision, the seventy weeks must form a part of the time mentioned in the vision. And as the instruction concerning the seventy weeks would not aid in any way in locating the commencement of the 2300 days unless they were to begin at the same time, we are held to the conclusion that the two periods coincide at their commencement. "Seventy weeks are determined," — literally, "cut off." See "Sanctuary and Its Cleansing," chapter 6.

5. "To finish the transgression." That is, to fill up the cup of Israel's iniquity. This condition was reached at the first advent of Christ. Matt. 23:29-38. "To make an end of sins." This Christ did, in the sense of the prophecy, by making provision for putting away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. Heb. 9:26. "To make reconciliation for iniquity." This was done by Christ taking upon Himself the penalty of sin, that the law might be honored and the transgressor reconciled to God. 1 Cor. 15:3. "To bring in everlasting righteousness." The righteousness of God, which was seen in the spotless life of Jesus Christ, and which is given to every believer. Rom. 3:21-25. "To seal up the vision and prophecy." Evidently the words "seal up" are used in the sense of making sure instead of making secret. The seventy weeks were given to explain the vision and not to darken it, to reveal truth and not to cover it. They test every theory and view that are advanced concerning the 2300 days. They expose every false application, and make sure the true one. This will appear when its divisions are considered. Dan. 7:25-27. "To anoint the Most Holy." The earthly sanctuary was to be anointed before the ministration in it could begin. Ex. 30:25-30. So, after the death of Christ, He ascended to heaven to minister as our High Priest in the sanctuary, preparatory to which, according to the type, it would be anointed.
