### NOTES

1. Our High Priest ministers in both apartments of the temple in heaven. He is also said to open and shut a door in connection with His work. Hence we are led to conclude that these acts represent the change in His position from one apartment to the other. The close of His work in the holy place would be fitly illustrated by His shutting the door or entrance into it, and the commencement of His work in the most holy place would be forcibly represented by His opening the door into that apartment; and in so doing He places before His people an open door which no man can shut. This enables them to look by faith through that open door and see their great High Priest ministering before the ark in the temple of God. Rev. 11:19. We know by the type that the ark contains the holy law of God without one jot or tittle changed.

2. The Philadelphia church had this open door placed before them. Rev. 3:7, 8. This was the church that received the Advent message up to the autumn of 1844. They came right to the close of the great prophetic period in 1844, and there and then Christ placed before them an open door which reveals the ark of the testament to those who search to know the truth.

3. The Advent people in 1844 thought that the earth was the sanctuary, and that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the purification of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ, preparatory to its becoming the home of the redeemed. Hence they believed that the 2300 days reached to the second coming of Christ and the judgment, events which they supposed coincided in point of time.

4. Their bitter disappointment caused those who had a genuine Christian experience to study the Scriptures more carefully and prayerfully than ever before.

5. In reviewing their position, they found there was no mistake in regard to the time, and therefore they began to study the other part of the text, which says, "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." Some, however, thought the trouble was in the computation of the time, and they endeavored to readjust the prophetic periods; and this has led to all the time setting since 1844.

6. Those who carefully studied the subject of the sanctuary with a desire to know the truth, learned the facts that are being brought out in these lessons.
