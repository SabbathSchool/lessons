## CHRIST OUR ADVOCATE: HIS MINISTRY IN THE TRUE TABERNACLE

By Elder M. H. Brown

A new number of the BIBLE STUDENTS' LIBRARY, with the above title, will be ready in December.

Its publication at this time is very opportune, as the Sabbath School Lessons for the first quarter of 1895 are on the "Sanctuary." This little pamphlet will be helpful to all in their study of these lessons, and the importance of the subject is sufficient reason for giving this number a wide circulation.

It will be No. 128 of the Bible Students' Library. Price 10 Cents.

Order of any State Tract Society, or address as below.

We call attention to the specially Strong and Durable Bindings. The book is held in the covers by cloth joints, and will outlast, many times over, the cheap binding of the ordinary book of this kind.

# LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY FOR SENIOR CLASSES
January 5 to March 30, 1895

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The subject of the sanctuary is a very interesting and important one. One of the pioneer laborers in connection with the closing work of the gospel, Elder J. N. Andrews, well said, "It is like a golden thread that runs all through the Bible." When we remember that in it the whole plan of salvation centers, that an understanding of it is necessary to a knowledge of present truth and the work of God for this time, that it is indeed the key to our position and that the prayerful study of it opens before us a vast and fruitful field of Bible truth concerning which the great majority of the Christian world is confessedly ignorant, then we will, perhaps, better appreciate its value and the importance of giving it careful and thorough study.

It has been several years since our Sabbath schools have studied the subject of the sanctuary, and with the increased light and truth which we now enjoy as a people, its study ought to be of great interest and profit to us all. This will surely be the case with those who reverence the Lord and His sanctuary, and take up the study of the subject with true humility, a spirit of prayer, and a desire to know the truth as it is in Jesus.

The lessons are necessarily framed somewhat differently than the book study which we have had in our Sabbath schools during the last year and a half. The lessons on First Peter, First John, and the book of Luke, treat those scriptures chapter by chapter and verse by verse. Now, as we take up topical study again, it is necessary to refer at the close of each question to the text or the note which answers it. The number of lessons being limited to thirteen, the subject cannot be brought out as fully as we might desire; but it was thought that it would hardly be profitable to spend six months on that subject in our Sabbath schools at the present time; hence only thirteen lessons have been prepared.

In our present study of the sanctuary we have not had space, or thought it necessary, to consider all those scriptures that speak of the temple of Solomon and its subsequent history. They will not materially aid us in securing a knowledge of the subject in its practical bearing upon God's people at the present time.

The lesson writer would especially urge upon all the importance of heeding the excellent instructions in regard to Bible study given in the senior lessons on the book of Luke. They are most excellent, and are worthy of study and preservation. For books of reference in studying these lessons we recommend "Patriarchs and Prophets," "The Atonement," "The Sanctuary and Its Cleansing," "Early Writings," "Great Controversy," vol. 4, and "Christ Our Advocate."
