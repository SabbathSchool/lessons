### NOTES

1. "Taches." — These were clasps which hooked into the loops and joined the curtains together. The word is rendered "clasps" in the Revised Version. The clasps for the linen curtains were made of gold, while those used for the curtains of goats' hair were made of brass. Ex. 26:6, 11.

2. "For a covering for the tabernacle." It will be noticed that this expression conveys the idea that this curtain of goats' hair did not form a part of the tabernacle proper, but was a covering for it. The Revised Version renders it, "for a tent over the tabernacle." This expresses the thought still more plainly. The Common Version and the Revised Version both say, "Couple the tent together," in verse 11, and both versions say that "he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle," in Ex. 36:14. We would also call attention to the fact that, while in Ex. 26:6 it says the linen curtains "shall be one tabernacle," in verse 11 it says, when referring to the curtains of goats' hair, that the taches "couple the tent together, that it may be one." Also in verse 13 it speaks of the "curtains of the tent," and in verse 14 the rams' skins are called "a covering for the tent."

3. "The roof of the tabernacle and the tent." There is no general agreement among Bible scholars as to how the curtains were placed over the upright boards which constituted the sides and west end of the tabernacle. As the question is not one of practical importance, and we have no reliable data concerning it outside of the Bible, we will not occupy space presenting the various views on the subject that have been advocated.

4. The Lord evidently had a design in having the sanctuary and temple face the east. Sun worship was the great rival of the worship of the true God, and its worshipers always worshiped the sun towards the east. Those who came to the sanctuary or temple to worship must come to the door or front of the sanctuary, with their faces toward it, for in that sanctuary God's presence was manifested. In so doing they would turn their back upon sun worship and all the idolatry that centered in it; whereas, those who apostatized from God and worshiped the sun towards the east, as was their custom, turned their back on God and His worship, and this the Lord counted as the greatest abomination that could be committed. Eze. 8:5-16.
