### NOTES

1. WE are the Lord's by creation, for He gave us existence. He created us, Gen. 1:26, 27; 2:7. Having forfeited our lives by sin, Christ dies for us to redeem us from death. 1 Cor. 15:22. Therefore, we are the Lord's both by creation and redemption.

2. Six days of the week are to be used as days of ordinary labor, in the calling or employment to which God's providence has called us. By faithfulness in the duties of life, and doing all things heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men, we serve the Lord Christ. Col. 3:23, 24. Having permission to use the six days for secular labor, we call it secular or common time. The seventh day having been set apart as a holy day, we are commanded to keep it holy.

3. To use the Sabbath for ourselves, and not devote it to the Lord as holy time, is robbing Him. It belongs to the Lord, for He claims it as His. He calls it "My holy day." Isa. 58:13. Therefore, when we disregard God's claim, and disobey His command concerning the seventh day, we rob Him of holy time.

4. THE tithing system is based on the same principle as the Sabbath, viz., the right of property. The Sabbath and the tithe both belong to the Lord. He claims them as His. This claim dates back to the patriarchal age, and was recognized by Abraham and Jacob. The Lord has never relinquished His claim upon either; therefore they are both obligatory in all dispensations, from the fall to the restoration. The difference between the two obligations is this—the Sabbath was instituted as a memorial adapted to the race both before and after the fall, while the tithing system has grown out of man's sinful condition, and the need of a systematic plan to provide means for carrying on the work of the gospel in saving men from sin. The tithing system is therefore coeval with the preaching of the gospel.
