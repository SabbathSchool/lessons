### NOTES

1. THE Revised Version renders 2 Thess. 2:6, 7 as follows: "And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he [the man of sin] may be revealed in his own season. For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work; only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way." "For the secret of lawlessness is already working, till only the one restraining for the present be out of the way." Diaglott. Others are similar. The old English word "let" means hinder; the Greek word means withhold, or restrain. Now there is but one power in the universe that can keep antichrist out of the church, and that is the power which keeps him out of each individual heart, and that is Jesus Christ. But Christ will not dwell therein unless we desire it. If we bid Him go, He will leave, and then we are left to the working of the mystery of iniquity.

2. IN Revelation 17 the apostate church is represented as committing fornication. She was formerly espoused to Christ. 2 Cor. 11:2. She was bound to Christ by the law of God. To turn from Him and His law and to turn to others is to commit spiritual fornication, and become lawless. Paul refers to the same when he calls that apostasy the "man of sin." "Sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4), and the man of sin would be the sinner above all others. This man of sin is also the mystery of iniquity, or lawlessness, pointing again to opposition to God's law. Daniel describes the work of this power more particularly. It would speak great words against God. It would wear out the saints of God, and "think to change the times and the law" (Revised Version), or, as Wintle and Spurrell render, "the appointed times and the law," and the saints and the law shall be given into its hands for 1,260 years. These specifications the apostasy has fulfilled. It has blasphemed God. It has put to death His saints. Its spiritual domination lasted 1,260 years, from A.D. 538 to 1798. It has changed the first appointed time, the beginning of the day, from sunset, God's time, to midnight, and it has changed the day of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, and in thus doing has changed God's law. It has changed God's law in that very part which reveals Him for what He is, the Creator and Redeemer.

3. THE ten commandments as given in Roman Catholic catechisms are the same in substance as those given in Ex. 20:1-17, with the exception of the Sabbath commandment. The numbering is different, but in all other respects nine of them are essentially the same. The catechism calls the first two commandments one, and divides the tenth to make the full number, thus making the fourth commandment the third.

4. THE teaching of the Papacy is as follows:—
"Question—Say the third commandment.
"Answer—Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.
"Q.—What is commanded by the third commandment?
"A.—To spend the Sunday in prayer and other religious duties."—Butler's Catechism.
"Q.—How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?
"A.—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of."—Abridgment of Christian Doctrine.
