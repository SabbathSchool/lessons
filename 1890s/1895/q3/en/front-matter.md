## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

THERE is no more important question agitating the world to-day than the question of the Sabbath. It is not a mere question of a certain twenty-four hours of the week, but in the question of the Sabbath is involved the worship of the one true God, the power and authority of Christ Jesus our Lord, and our own salvation. The subject cannot be too thoroughly studied nor too well understood. Other styles of presenting the lesson have suggested themselves, but it is thought best to follow largely the familiar topical lesson of the past. The student cannot be too earnestly urged to do faithful work in the study of the lessons. It matters not though he may be in a general way familiar with the subject of the Sabbath; he needs to be more than that. He needs to know it in all its various phases, that he may meet the assaults of error. He needs to know Him who is Lord of the Sabbath, and whose power to regenerate and save, the Sabbath commemorates. He needs to know the blessing pronounced upon those, whoever they may be (for God is no respecter of persons), who take hold of God's covenant and keep the Sabbath from polluting it. Therefore, become familiar with all the lesson texts as early in the week as possible. Talk them over with others, pray over them, meditate upon them, consider what the Lord says, and "the Lord give thee understanding in all things."
