### NOTES

1. **Creative Power**—Jehovah is the true God, therefore He is the only God. He is the living God, therefore will always exist. In the very nature of things He therefore becomes an "everlasting King." Creative power is the great distinguishing characteristic of the true God. All things exist in Him; hence, when He speaks, things are. He takes the things that are not to bring to nothing things that are. He therefore can never be defeated, because He has in this all-creative power that which will overcome all opposition. Hence, whenever this Godhead is pointed out, or is contrasted with false gods, His creative power is the distinguishing characteristic. See Ps. 96:5; 115:1-15. See also Paul's preaching before the heathen. Acts 14:15; 17:22-25.

2. **God's Delight**—The Scripture tells us that God rested and was refreshed. The root word means to take a long breath. That is, when the six days' work was done, God looked it all over and was satisfied, delighted for the sake of man, even as the wise and loving parent is satisfied at the provision he makes for his children.

3. **God's Works**—The works of the Lord are great, and all who take pleasure therein appreciate their greatness. His works are also honorable and glorious. Certainly they should be remembered. To remember that which is great, honorable, and glorious, ought to be man's greatest pleasure, as it is for his highest good. God has therefore made His wonderful works to be remembered. What is a more fitting memorial than that day on which the Creator ceased His labors and contemplated His work with delight, the day around which clustered the great facts of a completed creation.
