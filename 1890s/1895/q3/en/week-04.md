### NOTES

1. THE Sabbath is a memorial not simply of creation, but of God, the Creator, the only God. "I am God," He tells us, "and there is none else beside Me." This must be the case; for if God is Creator, all else are creatures. The Sabbath is a remembrancer of the great and only God, and the creation is the greatest evidence of His Godhead.

2. EVERY extraordinary manifestation of God's power to the world is the showing forth of the same power by which the worlds were created. The creation of the heavens and the earth is the greatest manifestation that earth knows, for nothing would be greater than calling them out of nothing. The next greatest display of power was the redemption of His people from the chiefest of earthly opposing powers, in which the gods of the nations were proved to be vanity. This redemption from Egypt, this making of Israel a sanctified or separated people, was a display of God's great power such as had never been seen since the earth was created. God did this to show to Israel and the world that He alone was God, and to spread abroad His name, or character, in the earth. As the Sabbath was a memorial of God's creative power in the beginning, so it became to Israel not only a memorial of creation, but a memorial of the same power manifest in redemption and sanctification; and so it becomes to every child of God.

3. THE oldest idolatry which history records is sun worship, and it was also the most licentious. (See "Lord's Day," part 2, chapter 2.) As Sunday was dedicated to the sun, the times prohibited by the Lord, the times observed by Manasseh, must have included the festival of Sunday, the great rival of the Sabbath of the Lord.
