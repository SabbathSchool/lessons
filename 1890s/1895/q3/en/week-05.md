### NOTES

1. THE Sabbath of the Lord, properly kept when the people were devoted to God, was now, in their backslidden condition, buried under the tradition of the rabbis. Certain knots could not be tied or untied; two letters could not be written so as to be read together and so form a word; no more food than the weight of a fig could be carried; fire could neither be kindled nor extinguished; an emetic could not be given, nor a broken bone set, nor a dislocated joint righted; one kind of sandals might be worn, and another kind might not be; one could not lawfully carry a loaf, yet two could. Thus were the people burdened by many foolish restrictions, while the rabbis and priests with subtle casuistry justified actual breaches in God's law of the Sabbath on their own part.

2. IN the illustrations used by our Lord, the sheep falling into the pit, and the case of David, He did not present them to justify Himself. His own deeds justified Him. He said what He did to show them by their practice, and by the Scripture, which they professed to believe, that they were inconsistent, and so help them to become willing to learn what God had so long before told them, that He would have mercy and not sacrifice. Adding to God's commandments is will worship. He desires that we shall have the spirit of the Sabbath as well as its form.

3. THE Jews had the right day of the Sabbath, but their traditions and spirit had made it a burden instead of a blessing. Jesus placed it back where God ever designed it should be, a boon of life to man. Here came the test—the Sabbath, a blessing as kept by Jesus and enjoined in the law, or the Sabbath as interpreted by human tradition, and enforced by human law upon men's consciences. To reject the first was to reject Christ. To reject the second was to suffer persecution (see John 9:14, 23, 34), and finally, as in the case of Jesus, death (John 5:16-18). In these days the circumstances are the same with one exception—the sabbaths are different—but it is still tradition against the word of God.
