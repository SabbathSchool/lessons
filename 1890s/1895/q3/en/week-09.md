### NOTES

1. THAT the message of the angel of Rev. 14:6, 7 (symbolizing God's messengers) is applicable to the last days alone is evident, (1) from the message given, "The hour of God's judgment is come." Paul preached the gospel in view of a judgment to come. Acts 17:31; 24:25. But in this text it declares that it is come. The investigative judgment, beginning in 1844, had then begun. (2) The second and third messages follow or go with the first, and the coming of the Lord immediately follows. The message therefore pertains to the last days. It is a part of the great Threefold message by which God would save the last generation.

2. FEAR, or reverence, of God is exercised only by a meek and humble heart, which realizes its own nothingness and God's completeness. Such a heart will count God's wisdom greatest and His ways the best. It will therefore render to Him the glory due, or, what is the same thing, submit willingly to keep His commandments. God will do the rest.

3. THE scripture referred to in Jeremiah 6 doubtless has reference to Israel then, and because of that it was spoken to them; but it also has reference to the times in which we live, and therefore it is written for these days. We have at the present time the "peace and safety cry" of verses 14, 15 (see 1 Thess. 5:1-3); we have the message of the Lord calling His people back to the old ways and His watchmen to listen to the sound of the trumpet of coming danger (see Joel 2:1; Rev. 14:6, 7); we have the refusals to walk in His way or to listen to the sound of the trumpet; we have the gathering out of the remnant church (Jer. 6:9), which will keep the law of God (Rev. 12:17); and finally God's judgments upon the people because they have rejected His law (Rev. 14:9-11).

4. CHRIST'S salvation which is near to come, and His righteousness which is to be revealed, cannot relate to the salvation which He has ever been constantly bestowing upon believing sinners. It is to His everlasting salvation (Isa. 45:17), with which He will save His people at His coming, for which the earth is now groaning; and which will be given at the second coming of Christ. See Isa. 25:9; Luke 21:28; Rom. 8:23; Heb. 9:28. That righteousness will also be revealed in its fullness when Christ comes. Ps. 50:3-6. At the time predicted in the prophecy, which is this time, the Sabbath of the Lord will be a matter of agitation, of testing, of blessing.

5. ISAIAH 58 and 59 are both parts of one prophecy; there should be no chapter heading between them. They are both a part of the same message, the first part containing reproof, instruction, and warning; the second part, denunciation upon the wicked, and promises for those who heed the message. The time to which it applies is just before the Lord comes with vengeance to recompense His enemies and to save His people. See Isa. 59:17-20. Out of His people to whom this message is sent will come those who will build up the "waste places" of God's downtrodden law, "raise up" the highway of God's holiness, repair "the breach" made by the man of sin, etc. To do this they will turn away their feet from the Sabbath. This work is now being carried forward. The standard of God's truth is erected against the enemy. Rev. 12:17; Isa. 59:19; Rev. 14:12.
