## Notes

1. Paul was so fully imbued with the Christ life, and so fully wrapped up in service for Christ, that life itself meant Christ to him. A lengthening of his life would be so much more of Christ and of service for Him.

2. As Paul languished in prison, in his old age, more closely guarded and with less liberty than at first, with his life at the disposition of the cruel Nero, bearing upon his body the scars of stoning and beating, and withal prepared to meet his God, to die did indeed seem to him gain—release from care and calumny and the buffeting of Satan. Wear-ing labor and readiness to go sometimes make sweet indeed the thought of sleeping in Jesus till the resurrection morning.

3. By "the fruit of my labor," Paul evidently means the magnifying of Christ. He did not know whether life or death would be meted out to him; but of one thing he was sure— that if he was to live, his life would mean the magnifying of Christ through continued labor.

12. In modern Greek, it is the word used when making a present.
