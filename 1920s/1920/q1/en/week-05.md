## Notes

1. The "if" used at the beginning of this verse is riot intended to cast any doubt or uncertainty about the reality of the believer's privileges in Christ, but it is an effective way of making this remarkable series of virtues in Christ a basis of appeal for unity among the Philippians. The "if" is really equivalent in force to "since." Christ is the great consoler of the grieved and sorrowing heart, of the afflicted and buffeted soul.

2. Unity is one of the greatest evidences that Christ is dwelling with His people. Christ is the head of the church. All draw strength and comfort from Him. As He ministers grace to His followers, they enjoy the same things, think the same things, talk the same things. Hearts and minds are bound together in unity and loving communion.

3. The tendency is for a man to think better of himself— his ideas, his ways, his achievements—than of others. When Christ really dwells in the heart, this is all reversed. The man gets a new vision of himself. He really sees better things in others than in himself, and esteems them more than himself. Under such a condition, there is no place for strife or for the vain sort of glory so natural to the human heart.

5. The things of His own on which Christ could look, were no ordinary things. He was "in the form of God"— His "express image" and likeness in every respect, possessing His attributes, and one with Him. He was also "equal with God." Yet with all this, He did not regard this blessed estate as something to be clung to, to be prized above every other consideration. He would look also upon the things of others—the state of men created in the image of God, but now eternally lost if left without a deliverer.
