## Notes

1. The word "crown" here is not the diadem, a symbol of kingly authority, but a wreath of olive or laurel, as a symbol of victory or honor, such as was placed upon the head of a winner in athletic or musical or oratorical contests among the Greeks. Thus Paul looked upon the fruits of his labor in the gospel as his crown of honor and of joy.

2. Evidently there were some differences between these two members of the church, which Paul feared might, if not reconciled, have a bad influence. Hence he entreats that these differences be taken before the Lord and composed in Him. How often we find a similar situation in the church to-day! Certain members of the church are at variance, per-haps over small affairs. They hardly speak when they meet, and they cherish hard feelings toward each other. Yet they go to the same service, worship the same God, and hope to live in the same heaven. Let all differences be composed in the Lord.

3. "Careful" means full of care, anxiety, worry. "Prayer" —worshipful communion. "Supplication"—petition for things needed. "Thanksgiving"—giving of thanks for what has been received and is being enjoyed. "Made known, unto God"—tell God how much you love and reverence Him, what you need, how much you value what He has given you.

5. The particular word "do" used here does not mean, as often, make or construct something, but to put into prac-tice. It is indeed the word from which we get our word "practice." The study of these lessons will benefit us nothing if we do not put into practice the many good things we are learning in them.
