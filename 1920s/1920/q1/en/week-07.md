## Notes

1. The church at Philippi seems to have been the object of much tender regard by the apostle Paul. The Philippians were his first converts in "the regions beyond" Asia, that is, in Europe. They were among the most substantial and steadfast of the Christians. The epistle to them is more in the style of a letter, not a treatise, than any other of his epistle's. The apostle bore their welfare continually on his heart, as they did also Paul's, ministering to his needs in a substantial way. Paul had already been in Rome a con-siderable length of time, besides being nearly a year on the way there. He longed to know more of their welfare, and decided to send Timothy to visit them, regardless of what it would mean to himself to lose for months the companion-ship of so valued an associate and worker.

4. Not only was Timothy trusted by Paul, but he had the confidence of the Philippian believers also. He had come to Philippi with Paul the first time in response to the Mace-donian call, and remained true through the severe experiences of Paul and Silas in that city. Hence he would be warmly received by the Philippian brethren.

5. Epaphroditus was himself a Philippian, who had been sent with gifts to Rome to minister to Paul's necessities. He had not returned at once, but had labored in Rome until he fell sick.
