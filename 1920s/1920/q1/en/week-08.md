## Notes

1. There are many things in the course of life to enjoy if our eyes are open to see and appreciate them. Rejoicing in the Lord includes all these that are good, when He is recognized as their Giver and is honored in their use. But it includes much more than these. The child of God can re-joice in tribulation, in hardship, in sorrow, in disappoint-ment, in many things that ordinarily distress. In fact, aside from sin, there can come to the Christian no experience which he may not make an occasion for rejoicing in the Lord.

2. Paul appeared to be closing his epistle; but it occurs to him to go over again some things he has already presented to the Philippians, for the sake of their safety. He does not tire of repeating if only he can get results.

3. To the Jews, a dog was the symbol of uncleanness. The term "evil workers" probably refers to grumblers and dis-puters, and to those given to strife and vainglory. Concision, or mutilation, appears to be a reflection upon those who per-sisted in the rite of circumcision, which, since it was done away in Christ, amounted to no more than mutilation of the flesh.
