## Notes

1. Paul's joy in writing to the Philippians was not only that they had accepted and obeyed the gospel while he was with them, but, much more, that they had continued faith-ful after he left them. Now he was anxious that they go on to perfection. The salvation offered us through the gospel is not merely a thing for acceptance, but it is to be wrought out in patient continuance in well-doing. We must fight out the good fight of faith. We must forge the steel of character. We must press toward the mark—the full stature of Christ.

2. Here is the secret of success in working out our own salvation: (literally) "God energizes us." When the will is weak, His indwelling Spirit energizes it, and we can then will what we ought to will. When we lack power to do, He energizes us, and we can then do what we ought to do. Best of all, His energizing is always in line with His pleasure, not ours. It enables us always to say, "Not my will, but Thine, be done." Oh, wonderful provision of grace! What wonder-working power!

4. The expression, "If I be offered," reads literally, "If I am being poured out as a libation." It was the heathen custom, in offering a victim in sacrifice to the gods, to pour unmixed wine upon the offering as a mark of honor. This was called the libation, or pouring. Alluding to this cus-tom, and to the possibility of his life's being taken by the Roman authorities, Paul vividly and beautifully pictures himself as possibly being already in the process of libation by the shedding of the blood, upon the sacrifice of the faith of the Philippians. The word "sacrifice" in the verse means the victim offered; and the word "service," the religious ceremony of offering the sacrifice. Such a rite would be the expression of faith.

5. The words "joy" and "rejoice" read literally: "I re-joice and co-rejoice;" that is, I rejoice on my part, and I join you all in rejoicing, that we are united in performing so holy a service on the altar of Christ—you the sacrifice, I the liba-tion. The wine of my libation is truly unmixed—pure, genuine, undiluted. Your sacrifice is spotless and without blemish. It is an offering of sweet savor, well pleasing to God.

6. As Paul could look forward with joy to yielding up his life for the gospel if God so willed, so, nobly, he prepares the Philippians for his possible death by bidding them rejoice with him that he should be counted worthy to suffer even the extreme penalty for Christ. A willing sacrifice, an unmixed libation! To such an extent does God energize us to will and to do according to His good pleasure.
