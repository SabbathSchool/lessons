## Notes

2. The remarkable leading of the Spirit that brought Paul to Philippi marks the first entrance of the gospel from Asia into Europe. The wording of his call therefore becomes eminently fitting to voice the appeal for gospel succor from every land. The fact is worth noting here that at the present writing, the Macedonian call to our people is being heard and heeded. More than a hundred missionaries a year are be-ing sent to the regions beyond. Many mission fields are be-ing entered for the first time.

3. The work of the gospel got a footing in Philippi through faithful women of prayer, one of whom became to Paul and Silas what Mary and Martha were to Jesus in the way of devotion and hospitality. Let no one to-day speak slightingly of a company of believers as being "all sisters." The faithfulness of many a "sister," in both Bible and modern times, has brought salvation to her household, and even formed the nucleus of a church, as did that of Lydia. It is significant that Satan opposed the work of Lydia through another woman, the "damsel," causing her apparently to commend the work of the apostles in order to confuse their efforts with works of "divination."

4. "Dispossessed of the evil spirit and restored to her right mind, the woman chose to become a follower of Christ. Then her masters were alarmed for their craft.... Many others in the city were interested in gaining money through satanic delusions.... Stirred by a frenzy of excitement, the multi-tude rose against the disciples. A mob spirit prevailed, and was sanctioned by the authorities, who tore the outer gar-ments from the apostles, and commanded that they should be scourged," and thrown into prison.â€”"Acts of the Apostles," page

6. Among the charter members of the church in Philippi were three notable characters: Lydia, the merchant-woman, evidently a person of means and influence; the "damsel pos-sessed with a spirit of divination." healed and converted; the "keeper of the prison," cruel, relentless, desperate to the point of taking his own life, but converted, baptized, rejoicing, and "believing in God with all his house." Such were the first believing Philippians. What wonder that they loved Paul and ministered to him, and were so loved by him as to call forth the most affectionate and joyful of all his epistles! In the words of Doremus A. Hayes: "They gave to their own dear apostle, but only that he might minister to others as he had ministered to them. He was their living link with the work in the mission field."
