## Notes

1. Paul was no ordinary prisoner. His being in bonds became known generally, even in the palace of the emperor. But this was not all; for it was understood that he was in bonds in Christ, that is, for Christ's sake, for the preaching of Christ. This was the chief thing in Paul's estimation, and affords his reason for saying that his imprisonment was fur-thering the gospel. Whatever brought Christ to the atten-tion of the people, was in the interests of spreading the gospel.

2. "There is a lesson for us in this experience of Paul's; for it reveals God's way of working. The Lord can bring victory out of that which may seem to us discomfiture and defeat. We are in danger of forgetting God, of looking at the things which are seen, instead of beholding by the eye of faith the things which are unseen. When misfortune or calamity comes, we are ready to charge God with neglect or cruelty. If He sees fit to cut off our usefulness in some line, we mourn, not stopping to think that thus God may be work-ing for our good. We need to learn that. chastisement is a part of His great plan, and that under the rod of affliction the Christian may sometimes do more for the Master than when engaged in active service."—"Acts of the Apostles," page

3. That is, in the general discussion about Paul's im-prisonment, some were talking against the Christ whose cause he represented, or at least without full knowledge or ac-ceptance of Him, while others were talking for Him in full acceptance.

5. The word "salvation" here evidently refers to Paul's safety or deliverance from prison. In the following verses, he discusses the alternative of life or death; yet through it all, as is easily seen, he really expects to be spared for fur-ther labor. There is in this passage a remarkable spirit of resignation to God's will, so far as life or death is concerned. Paul's chief passion in either case was only that Christ might be magnified. Only God knows whether we can glorify Him more and serve His cause better by continued life or by death. We can always leave that question entirely with Him, and let our chief interest be to magnify Christ in either case.

6. Paul was always concerned, and so may every Chris-tian be, lest in some way he dishonor Christ, and so bring himself into shame and disgrace in his own eyes. Failure to witness for Christ is one way of doing this. Hence Paul prayed for boldness—the word here meaning freedom and frankness in speaking.
