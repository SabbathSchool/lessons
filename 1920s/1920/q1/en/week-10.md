## Notes

20. Some of the Philippian church had been "in the truth" for ten years, and repeatedly visited and instructed by Paul and other workers. They ought to be mature enough in the faith to eat strong meat, and to press forward toward Christian perfection.

2. Paul's literal language is: "And if ye are thinking otherwise in any respect, God will reveal this also to you," that is, God will open up this advanced way of looking upon the Christian's duty and privilege.

4. The literal word "citizenship" was very expressive to the Philippians. Philippi was a Roman colony at that time. Its people enjoyed the full rights of Roman citizenship, as did also Paul and Silas, who brought them the gospel. They might well be proud, as they were, of these rights, which as-sured them protection and justice from the empire that ruled the world. But in contrast to those "who mind earthly things," Paul reminded the Philippians that their citizenship was now in heaven. Their emperor is the King of the uni-verse. In due time, He will come and escort His subjects to the wedding feast that is to usher in His eternal kingdom of glory.
