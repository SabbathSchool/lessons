## Notes

1. While Paul includes Timothy in his greeting to the Philippian church, obviously the letter is not jointly written. After the salutation, the singular number of the pronoun in the first person is used all the way through. Note the frequent use of "I," "my," and "me."

3. The mention of bonds, the palace, and Caesar's house-hold, indicate that Paul was a prisoner in Rome for the first time when he wrote the epistle. Timothy was with him as companion and laborer, but not as prisoner. His previous association with Paul in the work at Philippi made it very fitting for him to be mentioned in Paul's greeting to the Philippian believers.

7. The use of the term "bowels" here and elsewhere in the Scriptures, especially in the writings of Paul and Jere-miah, grows out of the ancient conception that the seat of the emotions is located in that region of the body, because of certain physical sensations we all have experienced in cases of fear, affection, pity, distress, and the like. It is an ex-pression of intensity.
