## Notes

2. The word "win" means literally gain. All through this balancing of values, Paul is using terms of the ac-countant. All his own advantages of birth and education were put in the column of gains before he knew Christ. But now comes a new casting up of accounts, and these gains pass into the column of losses, with Christ, the "hidden treasure" he had found; on the credit side of his loss and gain account. The balancing of the account shows that he has gained Christ in the transaction.

31. At times, he seems almost to court as a privilege the laying down of his life as Christ had done. Certainly he was always willing to yield it. Thus was Paul "conformable unto His death," while gladly pay-ing any price in order that he might know—experience— "the power of His resurrection."

7. Every Christian can look back with sorrow on the mistakes and failures of the past. Some of these were re-sults of weakness, like Peter's denial of his Lord; some came from a misconception of duty, like Paul's persecution of Christians before his conversion, when he verily thought he was doing God service. But from whatever cause these failures come, there is little comfort or encouragement in looking back upon them, either in one's own life or in that of his neighbor. It is infinitely better to "reach forth unto those things which are before." God is willing to remember our sins against us no more, and our neighbor's sins against him no more. And does He not expect the same of us?

8. The language is again borrowed from the athletic con-test: "I pursue the race toward the goal for the prize." The prize is the calling on high, the calling heavenward, of God in Christ Jesus.
