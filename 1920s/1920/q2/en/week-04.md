## Notes

59. .  Man has never attempted to measure the velocity of anything traveling faster than light.  Light travels 186,000 miles a second—more than seven times around the earth in one second of time.  Yet angels can travel faster than this.  Ezekiel wrote of their movement that they £'ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning." Men may move about by train, automobile, or aeroplane, at the speed of sixty, seventy-five, ninety, and even more, miles an hour.  When we compare such movement to that of an angel, it is as nothing.  Faster than the telegraph message these heav-enly messengers speed on their errands of ministry to man. . "Here a messenger from heaven, standing before the throne of God when Daniel began to pray, was commanded SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY to come to the prophet, and to give him skill and under-standing concerning the revelations of Jehovah.  While the prayer was still on his lips, before he had closed his petition, a messenger from the throne of God was at Daniel's side, an-nouncing, 'At the beginning of thy supplications the com-mandment came forth, and I am come to show thee.' Surely one could not ask for a more speedy response to his suppli-cation than this. "Notice the expression 'being caused to fly swiftly.' Our Father knows the need of immediate help for His children, and when the occasion demands, He causes His more than lightning-swift messengers to quicken their flight.  The angel did not have to search from place to place in Babylon to find Daniel.  He did not have to look for him in the palace of the king, or in the council halls of the wise men, or among the throngs in the streets, but he came direct from the throne of God to Daniel's side.  No earthly monarch ever sent so swift a messenger to bear tidings of good or ill as Jehovah sent to this prophet in prayer.  No heart of love, bound by the strongest cords of devotion, ever yet sent so quick an answer to the object of his affections as God sends through His holy angels to those who trust in Him.  For our Lord is no respecter of persons; what He did for Daniel, He will do for the humblest of His children who serve Him in sin-cerity and offer their petitions to Him in faith."—Id., pages ,
