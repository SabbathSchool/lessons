## Notes

39. . " 'The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them;' God commissions His angels to save His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them from 'the pestilence that walketh in darkness,' and 'the de-struction that wasteth at noonday.' Again and again have angels talked with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places of security.  Again and again have the encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits of the faithful, and carrying their minds above the things of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white robes, the crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers will receive when they surround the great white throne."— "The Acts of the Apostles," page  

153. . "Between the servant of God and the hosts of armed foemen was an encircling band of heavenly angels.  They had come down in mighty power, not to destroy, not to exact homage,, but to encamp round about and minister to the Lord's weak and helpless ones. "When the people of God are brought into strait places, and apparently there is no escape for them, the Lord alone must be their dependence."—"Prophets and Kings," page  

257. . "From ,the story of Daniel's deliverance, we may learn that in seasons of trial and gloom, God's children should be just what they were when their prospects were bright with hope and their surroundings all that they could desire.  Dan-iel in the lions' den was the same Daniel who stood before the king as chief among the ministers of state and as a prophet of the Most High.  A man whose heart is stayed upon God will be the same in the hour of his greatest trial as he is in prosperity, when the light and favor of God and of man beam upon him.  Faith reaches to ;the unseen, and grasps eternal realities.  SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 17 "Heaven is very near those who suffer for righteousness' sake.  Christ identifies His interests with the interests of His faithful people; He suffers in the person of His saints; and whoever touches His chosen ones touches Him.  The power that is near to deliver from physical harm or distress is also near to save from the greater evil, making it possible for the servant of God to maintain his integrity under all circum-stances, and to triumph through divine grace."—Id., page  

545. . "Said the angel, 'List ye!' Soon I heard a voice like many musical instruments all sounding in perfect strains, sweet and harmonious.  It surpassed any music I had ever heard, seeming to be full of mercy, compassion, and elevating, holy joy.  It thrilled through my whole being.  Said the angel, `Look ye!' My attention was then turned to the company I had seen, who were mightily shaken.  I was shown those whom I had before seen weeping and praying in agony of spirit.  The company of guardian angels around them had been doubled, and they were clothed with an armor from their head to their feet.  They moved in exact order, like a company of soldiers.  Their countenances expressed the severe conflict which they had endured, the agonizing strug-gle they had passed through.  Yet their features, marked with severe internal anguish, now shone with the light and glory of heaven.  They had obtained the victory, and it called forth from them the deepest gratitude, and holy, sacred joy." —"Early Writings," pages 270,
