## Notes

107. . "This Ethiopian represents a large class who need to be taught by such missionaries as Philip,—men who will hear the voice of God, and go where He sends them.  There are many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot understand their true import.  All over the world men and women are looking wistfully to heaven.  Prayers and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the Holy Spirit.  Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be gathered in. "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light, and who was ready to receive the gospel; and to-day angels will guide the footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and refine and ennoble their hearts.  The angel sent to Philip could himself have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this is not God's way of working.  It is His plan that men are to work for their fellow men."—Id., page  

109. . "Interesting indeed are these minute directions of the angel.  He knew Simon, knew his surname, knew where he was, the name of the city in which he was stopping, the man at whose house he was lodging, his name, and the street in which he lived.  Such intimate knowledge shows that angelic beings know all about man.  They know his lying down and his rising up, his faithfulness or negligence, his zeal and earnestness, his lukewarmness and barrenness of soul; they are messengers of Him who knows even man's very thoughts afar off."—"Ministry of Angels," page  

182. . "The angel, after his interview with Cornelius, went to Peter, in Jappa."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page  

135. . "Because Cornelius was living in obedience to all the instructions he had received, God so ordered events that he was given more truth.  A messenger from the courts of heaven was sent to the Roman officer and to Peter, in order that Cornelius might be brought into touch with one who could lead him into greater light. "There are in our world many who are nearer the king-dom of God than we suppose.  In this dark world of sin, the Lord has many precious jewels, to whom He will guide His messengers.  Everywhere there are those who will take their stand for Christ.  Many will prize the wisdom of God above any earthly advantage, and will become faithful light-bearers.  Constrained by the love of Christ, they will constrain others to come to Him."—Id., pages 140,  

141. "Heavenly intelligences are waiting to cooperate with human instrumentalities, that they may reveal to the world SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 35 what human beings may become, and what, through their influence, they may accomplish for the saving of souls that are ready to perish."-"Testimonies for the Church," volume , page  

30. "Heavenly angels have long been waiting for human agents-the members of the church-to cooperate with them in the great work to be done.  They are waiting for you.  So vast is the field, so comprehensive the design, that every sanctified heart will be pressed into service as an instrument of divine power."-Id., pages 46,
