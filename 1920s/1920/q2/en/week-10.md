## Notes

60. . "After the foe had departed, Jesus fell exhausted to the earth, with the pallor of death upon His face.  The angels of heaven had watched the conflict, beholding their loved Com-mander as He passed through inexpressible suffering to make a way of escape for us.  He had endured the test, greater than we shall ever be called to endure.  The angels now ministered to the Son of God, as He lay like one dying.  He was strengthened with food, comforted with the mes-sage of His Father's love, and the assurance that all heaven triumphed in His victory."—Id., page  

181. . "Some were casting stones at Him, when suddenly He disappeared from among them.  The heavenly messengers who had been by His side in the synagogue were with Him in the midst of that maddened throng.  They shut Him in from His enemies, and conducted Him to a place of safety." —Id., page  

240. . "The worlds unfallen and the heavenly angels had watched with intense interest as the conflict drew to its close.  Satan and his confederacy of evil, the legions of apostasy, watched intently this great crisis in • the work of redemption.  The powers of good and evil waited to see what answer would come to Christ's thrice-repeated prayer.  Angels had longed to bring relief to the divine sufferer, but this might not be.  No way of escape was found for the Son of God.  In this awful crisis, when everything was at stake, when the mysterious cup trembled in the hand of the sufferer, the heavens opened, a light shone forth amid the stormy darkness of the crisis hour, and the mighty angel who stands in God's presence, occupying the position from which Satan fell, came to the side of Christ.  The angel came not to take the cup from Christ's hand, but to strengthen Him to drink it, with the assurance of the Father's love.  He SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 31 came to give power to the divine-human suppliant.  He pointed Him to the open heavens, telling Him of the souls that would be saved as the result of His sufferings.  He as-sured Him that His Father is greater and more powerful than Satan, that His death would result in the utter discom-fiture of Satan, and that the kingdom of this world would be given to the saints of the Most High.  He told Him that He would see of the travail of His soul, and be satisfied, for He would see a multitude of the human race saved, eternally saved."—Id., pages 693,  

694. . `•`No traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus stepped forth to meet His betrayer.  Standing in advance of His disciples He said, 'Whom seek ye?' They answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus replied, 'I am He.' As these words were spoken, the angel who had lately ministered to Jesus, moved between Him and the mob..  A divine light illuminated the Saviour's face, and ,a dovelike form overshadowed Him..  In the presence of this divine glory, the murderous throng could not stand for a moment.  They staggered back.  Priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to the ground."—/d., page  

694. . "Jesus bade him put up the sword, saying, `Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?' I saw that as these words were spoken, the countenances of the angels were animated with hope.  They wished then and there to surround their Commander, and disperse that angry mob.  But again sadness settled upon them, as Jesus added, `But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?' The hearts of the disciples also sunk in despair and bitter disappointment, as Jesus suffered Himself to be led away by His enemies. "The disciples feared for their own lives, and they all forsook Him and fled.  Jesus was left alone in the hands of the murderous mob.  Oh, what a triumph of Satan then!  And what sadness and sorrow with the angels of God!  Many companies of holy angels, each with a tall commanding angel at their head, were sent to witness the scene.  They were to record every insult and cruelty imposed upon the Son of God, and to register every pang of anguish which Jesus should suffer; for the very men who joined in this dreadful scene are to see it all again in living characters."—"Early Writ-ings," page  

168. . "From the first, Pilate was convicted that Jesus was no common man.  He believed Him to be an excellent char-acter, and entirely innocent of the charges brought against Him.  The angels who were witnessing the scene marked the convictions of the Roman governor, and to save him from. engaging in the awful act of delivering Christ to be crucified, an angel was sent to Pilate's wife, and gave her information SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY through a dream that it was the Son of God in whose trial her husband was engaged, and that He was an innocent suf-ferer.  She immediately sent a message to Pilate, stating that she had suffered many things in a dream on account of Jesus, and warning him to have nothing to do with that holy man."—Id., page  

173. . "As He passed upward, the awe-stricken disciples looked with straining eyes for the last glimpse of their as-cending Lord.  A cloud of glory hid Him from their sight; and the words came back to them as the cloudy chariot of angels received Him, `Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' At the same time there floated down to them the sweetest and most joyous music from the angel choir."—"The Desire of Ages," pages 830,  

831. . "These angels were of the company that had been waiting in a shining cloud to escort Jesus to His heavenly throne.  The most exalted of the angel throng, they were the two who had come to the tomb at Christ's resurrection, and they had been with Him throughout His life on earth.  With eager desire all heaven had waited for the end of His tarrying in a world marred by the curse of sin.  The time had now come for the heavenly universe to receive their King.  Did not the two angels long to join the throng that welcomed Jesus?  But in sympathy and love for those whom He had left, they waited to give them comfort. 'Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?' "—Id., pages 831,  

832. . "Heaven and earth are no wider apart to-day than when shepherds listened to the angels' song.  Humanity is still as much the object of heaven's solicitude as when common men of common occupations met angels at noonday, and talked with the heavenly messengers in the vineyards and the fields.  To us in the common walks of life, heaven may be very near.  Angels from the courts above will attend the steps of those who come and go at God's command."—Id., page  

48. "From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been preserved through the interposition of the angels, we shall never know, until in the light of eternity we see the provi-dences of God.  Then we shall know that the whole family of heaven was interested in the family here below, and that messengers from the throne of God attended our steps from day to day."—Id., page
