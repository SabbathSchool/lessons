## Notes

159. . "We need to understand better than we do the mission of the angels.  It would be well to remember that every true child of God has the cooperation of heavenly beings.  Invis-ible armies of light and power attend the meek and lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God.  Cherubim and seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's right hand, 'all ministering spirits, sent forth to min-ister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page  

154. . "Thus it is that Heaven ministers to man's needs.  These poor exiles were hopeless and friendless.  No more could they return to the abundance of Abraham's house.  Moreover, He to whom the future is as an open book, knew that Ishmael would not choose to walk in the paths of right-eousness; yet notwithstanding all this, He sent an angel from. heaven to this sorrowing mother and her suffering child to supply their needs. "In this dark world, there is many a mother whose heart aches as did Hagar's; many a one who, like the outcast Egyptian, knows not what to do.  Often her heart is too full for utterance.  There may be no true human friend to whom she can tell her sorrows, none from whom she may seek counsel.  In utter hopelessness, she may feel that life is too bitter to be borne, and long for the time when she may rest from her troubles.  But there is not one such who may not find comfort and help in God."—"Ministry of Angels," page .
