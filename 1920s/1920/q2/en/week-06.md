## Notes

442. "I was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful record of every offering dedicated to God, and put into the treasury, and also of the final result of the means thus bestowed.  The eye of God takes cognizance of every farthing devoted to His cause, and of the willingness or reluctance of the giver.  The motive in giving is also chronicled.  Those self-sacrificing, consecrated ones who render back to God the things that are His, as He requires of them, will be rewarded according to their works.  Even though the means thus consecrated be misapplied, so that it does not accom-plish the object which the donor had in view,—the glory of God and the salvation of souls,—those who made the sacrifice in sincerity of soul, with an eye single to the glory of God, will not lose their reward."—Id., pages 518,  

519. .  It is evident that angels are familiar with every de. tail of our lives (Eccl. 5: 6; 10: 20; 1 Cor. 11: 10, A.  R.  V.), and it is reasonable to believe that they are heavenly re-corders.  In each note of this lesson, quotations are given from the spirit of prophecy, declaring that angels are keep-ing these record books.  In 1882, an important testimony was sent to one of our denominational centers; the following paragraph is taken from it: "A few weeks since, I was in a dream brought into one of your meetings for investigation.  I heard the testimonies borne by students against Bro. —.  Those very students had received great benefit from his thorough, faithful in-struction.  Once they could hardly say enough in his praise.  Then it was popular to esteem him.  But now the current was setting the other way.  These persons have developed their true character.  I saw an angel with a ponderous book open, in which he wrote every testimony given.  Opposite each testimony were traced the sins, defects, and errors of the one who bore it.  Then there was recorded the great benefit which these individuals had received from Bro. —'s labors."—Id., volume 5, page  

59. . "It will pay, then, to improve the privileges within our reach, and, even at some sacrifice, to assemble with those who fear God and speak for Him; for He is represented as hearkening to those testimonies, while angels write them in a book.  God will remember those who have met together and thought upon His name, and He will spare them from the great conflagration.  They will be as precious jewels in His sight; but His wrath will fall on the shelterless head of the sinner."—Id., volume 4, page  

107. . "Some talk too much; they stand in this position, 'Re-port, and we will report it.' Miserable indeed is such a po-SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY sition!  If all these gossipers would ever bear in mind that an angel is following them, recording their words, there would be less talking and much more praying."—Id., volume 4, page  

40. "You all have an influence for good or for evil on the minds and characters of others.  And just the influence which you exert is written in the book of records in heaven.  An angel is attending you, and taking record of your words and actions.  When you rise in the morning, do you feel your helplessness, and your need of strength from God? and do you humbly, heartily. make known your wants to your heav-enly Father?  If so, angels mark your prayers, and if these prayers have not gone forth out of feigned lips, when you are in danger of unconsciously doing wrong, and exerting an influence which will lead others to do wrong, your guardian angel will be by your side, prompting you to a better course, choosing your words for you, and influencing your actions." —Id., volume 3, pages 363,  

364. . "Words and actions and motives are recorded; but how little do these light, superficial heads and hard hearts realize that an angel of God stands writing down the manner in which their precious moments are employed.  God will bring to light every word and every action.  He is in every place.  His messengers, although unseen, are visitors in the work-room and in the sleeping apartment.  The hidden works of ''darkness will be brought to light.  The thoughts, the intents and purposes of the heart, will stand revealed.  All things are naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do."—Id., volume 4, pages 589,  

590. . "Every man's work passes in review before God, and is registered for faithfulness or unfaithfulness.  Opposite each name in the books of heaven is entered, with terrible exactness, every wrong word, every selfish act, every unful-filled duty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissem-bling.  Heaven-sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted moments, unimproved opportunities, the influence exerted for good or for evil, with its far-reaching results, all are chron-icled by the recording angel."—"The Great Controversy," page
