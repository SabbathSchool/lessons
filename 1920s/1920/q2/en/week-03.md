## Notes

43. . "This language leaves us in a state of uncertainty concerning the precise number of the heavenly beings,— `thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thou-sand times ten thousand stood before Him.' We know that `ten thousand times ten thousand' equals one hundred million, but we can form no idea of the number represented by 'thou-sands of thousands.' Nowhere in the Word of God is given the exact number of the heavenly beings."—Id., page  

46. . "As night drew on, soldiers were stationed to guard the Saviour's resting place, while angels, unseen, hovered above the sacred spot.  The night wore slowly away, and while it was yet dark, the watching angels knew that the time for the release of God's dear Son, their beloved Com-mander, had nearly come.  As they were waiting with the deepest emotion the hour of His triumph, a mighty angel came flying swiftly from heaven.  His face was like the lightning, and his garments white as snow.  His light dis-persed the darkness from his track, and caused the evil angels, who had triumphantly claimed the body of Jesus, to flee in terror from his brightness and glory. ,one of the SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY angelic host who had witnessed the scene of Christ's humilia-tion, and was watching His resting place, joined the angel from heaven, and together they came down to the sepulcher.  The earth trembled and shook as they approached, and there was a great earthquake."-"Early Writings," page  

181. .  The Son of God is the "Archangel." See 1 Thess. 4:  

16. To no other being is given this exalted title.  The glory of His presence surpasses that of the angels.
