## Notes

98. . "In this instance a direct message from heaven was given to Abraham through the agency of a heavenly being.  The angel spoke in a language Abraham understood, giving him a message that greatly cheered his heart, and that re-vealed to him God's acceptance of his sacrifice.  When the Lord had thus tested His servant, He also revealed His purpose toward him and toward his seed."—/b. . "The words of the angel, 'I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God,' show that he holds a position of high honor in the heavenly courts.  When he came with a mes-sage to Daniel, he said, 'There is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael [Christ] your prince.' Of Ga-briel the Saviour speaks, in the Revelation, saying that 'He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John.' And to John the angel declared, 'I am a fellow servant with thee, and with thy brethren the prophets.' Wonderful thought —that the angel who stands next in honor to the Son of God, is the one chosen to open the purposes of God to sinful men." —"The Desire of Ages," pages 98,  

99. . "Christ sent and made known the Revelation to John by 'His angel.' A particular angel seems here to be brought to view.  What angel could appropriately be called Christ's angel?  May we not find an answer to this question in a significant passage in the prophecy of Daniel?  In Dan. 10: 21, an angel, which was doubtless Gabriel (see Daniel, chapters , 10, and 11: 1), in making known some important truths to Daniel, said, 'There is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.' Who Michael is, we easily learn.  Jude (verse 9) calls him the 'archangel.' And Paul tells us that when the Lord descends from heaven, and the dead in Christ are raised, the voice of the archangel shall be heard. 1 Thess:.4:  

16. And whose voice will be heard at that amazing hour when the dead are called to life?  The Lord Himself replies, 'Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice' (John 5: 28) ; and the previous verse shows that the one here referred to, whose voice will then be heard, is the Son of man, or Christ: It is the voice of Christ, then, that calls the dead from their graves.  That voice, Paul declares, is the voice of the archangel; and Jude says that the archangel is called Michael, the very personage mentioned in Daniel, and all referring to Christ.  The statement in Daniel, then, is, that the truths to be revealed to Daniel were committed to Christ, and confined exclusively to Him, and to an angel whose name was Gabriel.  Similar to the work of communi-SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 23 eating important truth to the 'beloved prophet' is the work of Christ in the Revelation of communicating important truth to the 'beloved disciple'; and who, in this work, can be His angel but he who was engaged with Him in the former work, that is, the angel Gabriel?"-"Daniel and the Revelation."
