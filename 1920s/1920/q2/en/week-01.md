## Notes

20. See 1 Chron. : 5) ; 'Ariel' (doubtless of angelic origin.  See Ezra 8: 16). "Michael means, 'Who is like God,' and hence is a fit title for Christ.  Gabriel signifies, 'The strength of God,' an ap-propriate name for the angel or being who stands next to Christ (Dan. 10: 21).  Uriel means, 'The light of God;' Ariel, `The lion of God.' "—"Bible Readings for the Home Circle," page  

524. . "Before the creation of man, angels were in existence; for when the foundations of the earth were laid, the morn-ing stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.'"—"The Great Controversy," page  

511. . "Satan commenced his deception in Eden.  He said to Eve, 'Thou shalt not surely die.' This was Satan's first lesson upon the immortality of the soul, and he has carried on this deception from that time to the present, and will carry it on until the captivity of God's children shall be turned.  I was pointed to Adam and Eve in Eden.  They partook of the forbidden tree, and then the flaming sword was placed around the tree of life, and they were driven from the garden, lest they should partake of the tree of life, and be immortal sinners.  The fruit of this tree was to perpetuate immortality.  I heard an angel ask, 'Who of the family of Adam have passed that flaming sword, and have partaken of the tree of life?' I heard another angel answer, 'Not one of the family of Adam have passed that flaming sword, and partaken of that tree; therefore there is not an immortal sinner.' The soul that sinneth, it shall die an everlasting death,—a death from which there will be no hope of a resurrection; and then the wrath of God will be appeased."—"Early Writings," page  

218. .  The American Revised Version reads, "For our wres-tling is not against flesh and blood, but against the prin-cipalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places." "The power and malice of Satan and his host might justly alarm us, were it not that we may find shelter and deliverance in the superior power of our Redeemer.  We carefully secure our houses with bolts and locks to protect our property and our lives from evil men; but we seldom think of the evil angels who are constantly seeking access to us, and against whose attacks we have, in our own strength, no method of defense.  If permitted, they can distract our minds, disorder THE HEAVENLY FAMILY CO SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY and torment our bodies, destroy our possessions and our lives.  Their only delight is in misery and destruction.  Fearful is the condition of those who resist the divine claims, and yield to Satan's temptations, until God gives them up to the control of evil spirits.  But those who follow Christ are ever safe under His watchcare.  Angels that excel in strength are sent from heaven to protect them.  The wicked one cannot break through the guard which God has stationed about His people."-"The Great Controversy," page
