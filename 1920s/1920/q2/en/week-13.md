## Notes

645. . "On each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and beneath it are living wheels; and as the chariot rolls upward, the wheels cry, 'Holy,' and the wings, as they move, cry, `Holy,' and the retinue of angels cry, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.' And the redeemed shout 'Alleluia!' as the chariot moves onward toward the New Jerusalem."—Ib. . "But suddenly a terrible change came over him.  His face became pallid as death, and distorted with agony.  Great drops of sweat started from his pores.  He stood for a mo-ment as if transfixed with pain and terror; then turning his blanched and livid face to his horror-stricken friends, he cried in hollow, despairing tones, He whom you have exalted as a god is stricken with death.. . "The same angel who had come from the royal courts to rescue Peter, had been the messenger of wrath and judgment to Herod.  The angel smote Peter to arouse him from slum-ber: it was with a different stroke that he smote the wicked king, laying low his pride, and bringing upon him the pun-ishment of the Almighty.  Herod died in great agony of mind and body, under the retributive judgment of God."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 151,  

152. .  Heavenly angels are both ministers of mercy and mes-sengers of wrath.  In the final harvest of earth, they will both reap the saved of the ages for the garner of God and gather the tares to be burned.  Blessed is the man who may be smitten by an angel as was Peter (Acts 12: 7) rather than be smitten as was Herod (Acts 12: 23). . "Then I saw a very great number of angels bring from the city glorious crowns,—a crown for every saint, with his name written thereon.  As Jesus called for the crowns, angels presented them to Him, and with His own right hand the lovely Jesus placed the crowns on the heads of the saints.  In the same manner the angels brought the harps, and Jesus presented them also to the saints.  The commanding angels first struck the note, and then every voice was raised in grate-ful, happy praise, and every hand skillfully swept over the strings of the harp, sending forth melodious music in rich and perfect strains."—"Early Writings," page
