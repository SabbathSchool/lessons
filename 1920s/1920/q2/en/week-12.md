## Notes

21. "In this work all the angels of heaven are ready to co-operate.  All the resources of heaven are at the command of those who are seeking to save the lost.  Angels will help you to reach the most careless and the most hardened.  And when one is brought back to God, all heaven is made glad; seraphs and cherubs touch their golden harps, and sing praises to God and the Lamb for their mercy and loving-kindness to the children of men."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page  

197. . "These angels are evidently symbolic; for the work assigned them is that of preaching the everlasting gospel to the people.  But the preaching of the gospel has not been in-trusted to literal angels; it has been committed to men, who are responsible for this sacred trust placed in their hands.  Each of these three angels, therefore, symbolizes a body of religious teachers, who are commissioned to make known to their fellow men the special truths which constitute the burden of these messages respectively. "But we are to consider further that angels, literally, are intensely interested in the work of grace among men, being sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of sal-vation.  And as there is order in all the movements and ap-pointments of the heavenly world, it may not be fanciful to suppose that a literal angel has charge and oversight of the work of each message."—"Daniel and the Revelation." . "I saw four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and were on their way to accomplish it.  Jesus was clothed with priestly garments.  He gazed in pity on the remnant, then raised His hands, and with a voice of deep pity cried, `My blood, Father, My blood, My blood, My blood!' Then I saw an exceeding bright light come from God, who sat upon SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 37 the great white throne, and was shed all about Jesus.  Then I saw an angel with a commission from Jesus, swiftly flying to the four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and waving something up and down in his hand, and crying with a loud voice, 'Hold!  Hold!  Hold!  Hold! until the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads.' "I asked my accompanying angel the meaning of what I heard, and what the four angels were about to do.  He said to me that it was God that restrained the powers, and that He gave His angels charge over things on the earth; that the four angels had power from God to hold the four winds, and that they were about to let them go; but while their hands were loosening, and the four winds were about to blow, the merciful eye of Jesus gazed on the remnant that were not sealed, and He raised His hands to the Father, and pleaded with Him that He had spilled His blood for them.  Then another angel was commissioned to fly swiftly to the four angels, and bid them hold, until the servants of God were sealed with the seal of the living God in their fore-heads."—"Early Writings," page  

38. . "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, de-scending to the earth, and again ascending to heaven, pre-paring for the fulfillment of some important event.  Then I saw another mighty angel commissioned to descend to the earth, to unite his voice with the third angel, and give power and force to his message.  Great power and glory were im-parted to the angel, and as he descended, the earth was light-ened with his glory. . . . "Angels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven, and I heard voices which seemed to sound everywhere, 'Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniqui-ties.' "—Id., page  

277. .  An angel has never failed to do a work given him of God.  The Bible records no instance of an angel unable to Perform a mission given him by High Heaven.  On one oc-casion, a king "withstood" an angel for three weeks, and Michael Himself (Christ) "came to help" the angel.  Dan. : 12,  

13. When a work is given to a heavenly angel, it will be done, even if all heaven has to join him to do it.  The angel with the inkhorn will finish his work.  The third angel's message movement cannot fail; it is in charge of an angel. "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven.  An angel with a writer's inkhorn by his side returned from the earth, and reported to Jesus that his work was done, and the saints were numbered and sealed.  Then I saw Jesus, who had been ministering before the ark containing the Ten Commandments, throw down the censer.  He raised His hands, and with a loud voice said, 'It is dor.e.' "—Id., page  

279. SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY . "When He [Jesus] leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth.  In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor.  The restraint which has been upon the wicked is removed, and Satan has entire control of the finally im-penitent.  God's long-suffering has ended.  The world has re-jected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His law.  The wicked have passed the boundary of their proba-tion; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at last withdrawn.  Unsheltered by divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one.  Satan will then plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one great, final trouble.  As the angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds of human passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose.  The whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that which came upon Jerusalem of old."—"The Great Con-troversy," page
