## Notes

153. . "Again the Lord granted Jacob a token of the divine care.  As he traveled southward from Mount Gilead, two hosts of heavenly angels seemed to encompass him behind and before, advancing with his company, as if for their pro-tection.  Jacob remembered the vision at Bethel so long before, and his burdened heart grew lighter at this evidence that the divine messengers who. had brought him, hope and SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 27 courage at his flight from Canaan, were to be the guardians of his return.  And he said, 'This is God's host; and he called the name of that place Mahanaim'—`two hosts, or camps.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page  

195. . "The struggle continued until near the break of day, when the stranger placed his finger upon Jacob's thigh, and he was crippled instantly.  The patriarch now discerned the character of his antagonist.  He knew that he had been in conflict with a heavenly messenger, and this was why his al-most superhuman effort had not gained the victory.  It was Christ, 'the Angel of the covenant,' who had revealed Himself to Jacob.  The patriarch was now disabled, and suffering the keenest pain, but he would not loosen his hold.-All penitent and broken, he clung to the Angel; 'he wept, and made supplication,' pleading for a blessing.  He must have the assurance that his sin was pardoned.  Physical pain was not sufficient to divert his mind from this object.  His determination grew stronger, his faith more earnest and persevering, until the very last.  The Angel tried to re-lease Himself; He urged, 'Let Me go, for the day breaketh;' but Jacob answered, 'I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.' Had this been a boastful, presumptuous confidence, Jacob would have been instantly destroyed; but his was the assurance of one who confesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts the faithfulness of a covenant-keeping God. . . . "While Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another heavenly messenger was sent to Esau.  In a dream, Esau beheld his brother for twenty years an exile from his father's house; he witnessed his grief at finding his mother dead; he saw him encompassed by the hosts of God.  This dream was related by Esau to his soldiers, with the charge not to harm Jacob, for the God of his father was with him. . . "At sight of that crippled sufferer, 'Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.' As they looked upon the scene, even the hearts of Esau's rude soldiers were touched.  Notwithstand-ing he had told them of his dream, they could not account for the change that had come over their captain.  Though they beheld the patriarch's infirmity, they little thought that this his-weakness had been made his strength."—Id., pages ,  

198. . "Into the experience of all there come times of keen disappointment and utter discouragement,—days when sorrow is the portion, and it is hard to believe that God is still the kind benefactor of His earthborn children; days when troubles harass the soul, till death seems preferable to life.  It is then that many lose their hold on God, and are brought into the slavery of doubt, the bondage of unbelief.  Could we at such times discern with spiritual insight the meaning of SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY God's providences, we should see angels seeking to save us from ourselves, striving to plant our feet upon a founda-tion more firm than the everlasting hills; and new faith, new life, would spring into being."—"Prophets and Kings," page . . "As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in the closing period of earth's history the Lord will work mightily in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the right.  He who walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace will be with His followers wherever they are.  His abiding presence will comfort and sustain.  In the midst of the time of trouble,—trouble such as has not been since there was a nation,—His chosen ones will stand unmoved.  Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God's saints.  Angels that excel in strength will, protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,' able to save to the uttermost those who have put their trust in Him."—Id., page
