## Notes

45. . "From this scripture, it is plainly seen that there are spiritual beings with spiritual bodies—bodies unlike the ma-terial bodies we possess.  Just as surely as there are earthly, or material bodies, just so surely are there spiritual bodies. `There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the ter-restrial is another.' It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.  There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.' Man was created with a natural, or material body.  He belongs to this earth; for he was made from the dust of the ground.  But though man's eyes are holden 'from perceiving spiritual beings with his natural senses, still these are revealed to him through the Word of God and by the influence of the Holy Spirit."—"Ministry of Angels," page  

35. .  When Jesus came into this world, He came as a man.  He did not take "the nature of angels," but He took the nature of "the seed of Abraham." Jesus, then, was made "for a little while" lower than the angels.  Read carefully Heb. : 7, 9, 17, noting marginal readings of the verses. . "Let us not forget that the promise is never given to man that he will at any time become an angel.  We are as-sured, however, that in one respect we shall be made equal to the angels—we shall not be subject to death.  Of those who are accounted worthy to have a part in the first resurrection, SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY Jesus Himself said, 'Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels.' At that long desired and trium-phant day, the saved of earth will be made 'equal unto the angels.' Every longing of the heart will find complete satis-faction.  The fear of death will be banished; and they will receive from the hand of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, the priceless gift of immortal life."-Id., page
