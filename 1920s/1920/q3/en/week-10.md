## Notes

12. .  I can do all things in Him that strengthens me—the Father working hitherto and I working. .  Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit as His personal representative, to teach us all things and to guide us into all truth; but He ordained that we receive the Holy Spirit, and that He teach through us.  On this condition, Jesus sends us into all the world to teach all nations and preach the gos-pel to every creature. .  Jesus through Paul bids us study to become workmen that need not be ashamed, vessels unto honor, meet for the Master's use, thoroughly furnished unto every good work. .  The Scriptures must be our chief study, in school and out; for they are able to make us wise unto our own salva-tion and unto the salvation of others. .  The Christian school is one of the chief agencies to save our children from the world, and to furnish the advent move-ment with laborers for the finishing of the work. "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest." SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 29
