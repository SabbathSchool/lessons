## Notes

33. .  Paul esteemed himself the least of the apostles, and unfit to be an apostle, because of sin; but he became chief of the apostles, by the grace of God, and by rejoicing in the infirmity which kept him from self-exaltation, that the power Jf Christ might rest upon him. .  Sitting at the feet of the greatest teachers of the day, even professed religious teachers, will not of itself fit young men and women for fruitful Christian service.  There are some who may even array them against the true cause of God.  SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 27 .  The sure way is to sit at the feet of the Master Teacher, learning in the school of Christ, as His disciples, receiving the Holy Spirit, as His apostles, then go forth every-where preaching the Word.
