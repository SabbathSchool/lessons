As the basis for Moses' great choice between the throne of earth's mightiest kingdom and suffering affliction with the people of God was laid in the first twelve years of his life, by his faithful mother-teacher, so should every parent see that his children are kept under Christian instruction during these vital, formative years. . As Joseph, listening in his father's tent to the rehearsal of God's dealings with His people, developed such confidence in God, by 'the .time he was seventeen, that he passed the terrible test of being sold into slavery and thrown into prison unjustly in a strange and heathen land, so may our sons and SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 21 daughters be established in faith if they have been diligently taught of God from childhood. . As David learned of God in the simple surroundings of pastoral life in his boyhood, and as he used his wonderful skill in music and poetry to give expression to the melody in his soul as he caught new glimpses of God, so may every youth learn of God, and devote his talent to the honor of God, if he is kept under environment and instruction of the right kind. . As Solomon, by the time he was twenty, had the dis-cernment to choose an understanding heart above all that wealth, power, and honor offered him, so may our maturing youth come out of our homes and schools, by the same age, with their choice fixed upon the wisdom and knowledge which Solomon commends, if they are led by their parents and teachers to cry out for and seek after the knowledge that "passeth understanding."
