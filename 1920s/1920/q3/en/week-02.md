SCHOOL, SOONAN, KOREA On every leaf of the forest and stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and sea and sky, God's name was written.  With both the animate and the inanimate creation,— with leaf and flower and tree, and with every living creature, from the leviathan of the waters to the mote in the sun-beam,—the dwellers in Eden held converse, gathering from each the secrets of its life.  God's glory in the heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, 'the balanc-ings of the clouds,' the mysteries of light and sound, of day and night,—all were objects of study by the pupils of earth's first school."—"Education," page  

21. .  The Garden of Eden was a perfect expression of God's ideal for the Christian home and school.
