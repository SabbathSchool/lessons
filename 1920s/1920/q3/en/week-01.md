## Notes

7. .  The trees in the garden had two properties: "pleasant to the sight" and "good for food." Food was a necessity, but the higher nature was also to be cultivated.  Beauty and strength are both elements of character.  Man was to enjoy both the fruit and the beauty of the tree; for this was closely akin to God's pleasure, and every provision was made for man to be Godlike. .  Two particular trees were planted in the garden as a test for the fidelity of the creature to his Creator.  Man was not to be a mere automaton in relation to his Maker, but SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 5 should have opportunity for the exercise of his free will in choosing to be or not to be true to God.  The test was made perfectly clear to him.  By partaking of the tree of life, he would live; by partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he would die.  Like the angels, he was placed on probation.  This test was all the more necessary because re-bellion had broken out in heaven, and a rebel leader challenged the justice of God; hence God would not impose His will arbi-trarily upon any of His creatures, but give them liberty of choice, with the consequences clearly before them. .  In the two trees of the garden is symbolized a founda-tion principle in Christian education: Choose "life and good"; shun "death and evil." (Deut. 30:  

15. ) Reduced to educa-tional practice, this means: Choose studies in which the good is unmixed with evil; shun studies in which there is evil un-mixed, or mixed with good.  It was not the Creator's purpose that man should obtain any knowledge of evil; but by par-taking of the forbidden tree, he would gain a knowledge of good and evil.  In the temptation of Eve, Satan pointed out only the good; but the evil was there.  At first, when she partook, Eve felt the thrill of only the good; but almost im-mediately the terrible reality of the evil settled down upon her.  Good is open and easy to identify; evil is hidden, subtle, and deceptive. .  CoNcLusioN: (a) In God's original plan, there was no separation between education and life.  They were insepa-rable.  The very purpose of forming man in the image of God, of giving him life, of clothing him with Godlike powers, and of placing him in a perfect environment, was that his powers might constantly unfold in Godlikeness.  This is edu-cation, it is true education, it is Christian education.  Educa-tion is the business of life.  The business of true education in this present life is to prepare ourselves and others for the life which is to come. (b) The best way to enrich life in the school of to-day, and cause it to unfold in harmony with God's plan, is to study only things of the following order: whatsoever things are true, are honest, are just, are pure, are lovely, are of good report; then "think on these things." Phil. 4:  

8. "Every member of the church a member of the Sab-bath school, and every member of the Sabbath school a member of the Lord's family." SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
