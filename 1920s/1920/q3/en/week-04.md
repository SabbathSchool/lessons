## Notes

21. .  After the fall, people were of two classes: sons of God and sons of men, according to their acceptance or rejection of the plan of redemption.  A true son of God is one who accepts Christ and lives by the Word of God. .  In the home, parents are enjoined to teach the Word of God "diligently" to their children morning and evening, all through the day, and every day. .  Abraham is commended for his faithfulness in main-taining an altar of worship, and teaching his children and household to the number of a thousand souls.  Its influence extended in a marked way over three generations following. .  Joseph's remarkable record of integrity and ability was owing largely to his early teaching in his father's tent.  While he was on his way to Egypt to be sold as a slave, "his thoughts turned to his father's God.  In his childhood he had been taught to love and fear Him.  Often in his fathel's tent he had listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he fled from his home an exile and a fugitive.  He had been told of the Lord's promises to Jacob, and how they had been fulfilled,—how, in the hour of need, the angels of God had come to instruct, comfort, and protect him.  And he had learned of the love of God in providing for men a Redeemer.  Now all these precious lessons came vividly before him.  Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would be his God.  He then and there gave himself fully to the Lord, and he prayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in the land of his exile.  His soul thrilled with the high resolve SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 13 to prove himself true to God,—under all circumstances to act as became a subject of the King of heaven.  He would serve the Lord with undivided heart; he would meet the trials of his lot with fortitude, and perform every duty with fidelity."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 213, 214-.  After Moses had been given into his mother's hands by Pharaoh's daughter to be nurtured, "she faithfully im-proved her opportunity to educate her child for God.  She felt confident that he had been preserved for some great work, and she knew that he must soon be given up to his royal mother, to be surrounded with influences that would tend to lead him away from God.  All this rendered her more diligent and careful in his instruction than in that of her other children.  She endeavored to imbue his mind with the fear of God and the love of truth and justice, and earnestly prayed that he might be preserved from every corrupting influence.  She showed him the folly and sin of idolatry, and early taught him to bow down and pray to the living God, who alone could hear him and help him in every emergency. "She kept the boy as long as she could, but was obliged to give him up when he was about twelve years old.  From his humble cabin home he was taken to the royal palace, to the daughter of Pharaoh, 'and he became her son.' Yet even here he did not lose the impressions received in childhood.  The lessons learned at his mother's side could not be for-gotten.  They were a shield from the pride, the infidelity, and the vice that flourished amid the splendor of the court."— Id., pages 243,  

244. .  Daniel's fidelity to God in a heathen court, is traceable to the influences that molded his character in his Judean home. "Joseph and Daniel proved themselves true to the principles of their early training. . . .  The same mighty truths that were revealed through these men, God desires to reveal through the youth and the children of to-day."— "Education," pages 56,  

57. . "Unfeigned faith" on the part of the grandmother and the mother may pass on to the son also, as it did to Timothy, because of his knowing the Scriptures from his childhood. .  Let every youth remember his Creator while he is yet young, and let every parent train up each child in the way he should go. .  Christian education in the home is the foundation of the integrity and usefulness of son or daughter wherever the providence of God may lead. "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest." SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
