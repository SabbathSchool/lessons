## Notes

46. .  What any one can do for God depends much upon the kind of education he receives in childhood and youth. .  Parents have the usefulness and destiny of their chil-dren largely in their own hands. .  The great danger of youth is that they will "learn the ways of the heathen" instead of the ways of God. .  In addition to a Christian home, the greatest safeguard for our children is to send them to a school whose avowed object is to "restore the image of God in the soul."
