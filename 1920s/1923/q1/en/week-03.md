## Notes

1. The Revised Version, margin, of this text reads, "My brethren, do ye, in accepting persons, hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory?" None who profess the pure and undefiled religion of our Lord should countenance any distinction, or manifest any partiality, among members of the church, because of difference in wealth or social stand-ing. We are all one in Christ Jesus.

2. While God is no respecter of persons, He is a respecter of character. He will immortalize a pure and holy character in His kingdom. We too should love and respect good charac-ter, no matter in whom it may be found.

3. We are here cited to the higher, supreme law, before which all will stand on an equality. There will be no •rich or poor, no high or low. Right and wrong, guilt and innocence alone will be considered. It is "the royal law" because it is the law of the great King. Before this law all must bow.. By it all differences must finally be settled.

37. This law is spiritual and perfect, extending to all the inward creations and outward actions of men, and can never be changed or annulled."—"Binney's Theological Compend," p.
