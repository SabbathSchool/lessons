6. What will the prayer of faith do? What blessing is as-sured to those who are raised up in answer to prayer? 

## Notes

1. "The end of the Lord." The word "end" here means object. There was a purpose in the trial and affliction of Job. The Lord was working toward an end. It is even so in the trials and afflictions that He permits to befall each of us. In trial, we are to learn that the Lord is pitiful and com-passionate.

2. "Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the judicial oath, in which God is solemnly called to witness that what is said is the truth, and nothing but the truth. Jesus Himself, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to testify under oath. The high priest said unto Him, 'I adjure Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus answered, 'Thou hast said.' Had Christ, in the Sermon on the Mount, condemned the judicial oath, He would at His trial have reproved the high priest, and thus, for the benefit of His followers, have enforced His own teaching."—"Mount of Blessing," p.

3. "The remedy is prayer; not necessarily to obtain the reward of trial, but at any rate for the increase of faith, to raise the spirits, so that we' be comforted and of good cheer." —"Speaker's Commentary."

4. "In the word of God we have instruction relative to special prayer for the recovery of the sick. But the offering of such prayer is a most solemn act, and should not be entered upon without careful consideration. In many cases of prayer for the healing of the sick, that which is called faith is noth-ing less than presumption."—"Ministry of Healing," p.

227. Read the entire chapter on this subject.

6. "If any who are seeking health have been guilty of evil speaking, if they have sowed discord in the home, the neigh-borhood, or the church, and have stirred up alienation and dissension, if by any wrong practice they have led others into sin, these things should be confessed before God and before those who have been offended."— Id., p.

18. We should remember that, Elijah was a man like ourselves, having the same passions and de-sires; and what God did for him in answer to prayer, He is able and willing to do for us, if we continue in prayer as Elijah did.
