## Questions

2. What is said of the condition of their earthly treasures? 

5. How are those who labor, represented as being treated? Who listens to their cry of distress? 

6. To what purpose have the rich employed their wealth? What have they worshiped? How is the terrible time in which they live described?

## Notes

1. "The term 'riches' •is to be taken... generically for all kinds of property having a money value which is proverbi-ally liable to loss or perishing."— Clarke.

3. "And he doth not resist." The poor have no one to plead their cause while they are groaning under the load of injustice and oppression. But if they wait patiently, the One into whose ears their cry has entered will give justice and equity to all.

4. The reference to the early and the latter rain has a broader application. The early rain was the rain of the seedtime, the latter rain was the rain of ripening for the harvest. The first fell in Judea about November; the second, toward the end of April, when the ears of grain were filling. Without these, the earth would have been unfruitful. In like manner, the former rain of the Spirit fell at Pentecost to water the seed. The latter rain is to fall to ripen the harvest of the earth. We are to be patient until then.

5. In the time of trial, we are not to grow impatient, and seek, as many do. to right wrongs by resorting to force and questionable methods; but we should look forward patiently to the time when Jesus will come and render a just reward to every man.
