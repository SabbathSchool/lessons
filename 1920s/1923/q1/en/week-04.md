## Notes

3. Faith is living, and manifests itself in good works. That kind of faith which permits a man to say, "I have faith," and at the same time allow the destitute to go unfed and unclothed, when he might minister to their needs, is of no avail. It is dead. It does not exist in reality. Such a person does not really believe. He is professing to be what he is not. The fruit seen in the life will determine whether or hot we have real faith. The tree is known by the fruit.

3. "The word which, is rendered 'yea' would be better rendered by 'but.' The apostle designs to introduce an ob-jection, not to make an affirmation. The sense is, 'Some one might say,' or, `To this it might be urged in reply.' That is, it might perhaps be said that religion is not always manifested in the same way, or we should not infer, because it is not always exhibited in the same form, that it does not exist. One man may manifest it in one way, and another in another, and still both have true piety. One may be distinguished for his faith, and another for his works, and both may have real religion."— Barnes. "But it must be a living faith— a faith that shows its sincerity by the sacrifices of self which it makes, by the works of love which it performs. A merely intellectual orthodoxy may be held by demons. A mere profession of faith may be worth no more than the body of a man without the breath of life. A true faith loves, works, lives. It regulates the conscience, the speech, and the life, by the conviction of God's constant presence; it shows its appreciation of spiritual realities by separation from the world. It takes the law of God as a reality, and; bringing its grand truths and inspiring motives to bear directly upon the conduct of every day, works by love."—"Bible in the Home," p.
