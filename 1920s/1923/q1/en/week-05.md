## Notes

1. The•plan of this epistle seems to be to call attention to such things as especially needed to be corrected. Some of the errors and improprieties that existed among the people have been noticed in the previous chapter. Others are noticed in this chapter. The Revised Version of this verse reads, "Be not many of you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment." "Evidently designed to censure the false mania for teaching, the dogmatizing contentiousness which is thoroughly characteristic of Judaizing Christians."— Lange.

2. "He who truly masters his words will master his works."

3. The Revised Version, margin, reads, "Behold, how great a forest is kindled by how small a fire!" The figure is that of a widespread conflagration kindled by the incendiary work of an unruly, unsanctified tongue.
