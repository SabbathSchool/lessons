## Notes

2. Many times we have occasion to regret that wet have spoken, but seldom that we remained silent. â€¢

3. It is not enough to look occasionally into the great mirror of God's law; because, as in looking into a glass, we soon lose sight of the defects shown us. We should continu-ally look into the law. of God, by which sin is revealed, not being forgetful hearers, but doers of the Word. Some en-deavor to destroy the law, because it reveals defects and failures in their lives. This is no wiser than it would be to dash a mirror into fragments because it revealed defects in our persons or clothing. Such are like the Hindu who, when the microscope made known to him the fact that there were living organisms in the water he drank, at once destroyed the microscope.

5. Much is said about the need of the' physical nature for pure water, pure air, and pure food. But that which is of the greatest importance is pure religion. It is possible to drink pure water, breathe pure air, and eat pure food, and yet be corrupt in heart, and have a censorious, domineering character. Only by the power of God, through the Holy Spirit, can the wicked, deceitful heart-of man be changed.
