## Notes

1. Among men, there are class distinctions; but all are one in Christ Jesus. Christianity brings all up on the same level. The true value of a man consists in moral worth. Character is what the Lord considers of value. Christ did not die for the talented and wealthy only.. He died for all. All have equal opportunity to be saved. The poor of this world, the ignorant, the downcast, the downtrodden, the one of lowly rank or humble circumstances, though of "low degree" in man's sight, may be of infinite value in God's sight. The rich of this world, without noble aspirations, covetous and selfish, unless they repent, may be only as a withered branch. Well indeed may such a one who comes to himself, and seeks the Lord in lowliness of spirit, rejoice in that his heart has beer broken and humbled.

2. Before we receive the crown, we must be tested. It is in trial that the chaff is separated from the wheat. There must be battle fields in every life. Fire and hammer and file are necessary to give form to metal. So character is shaped and brightened in trial. Those who faithfully endure the grinding, testing process, will receive the crown.

3. The word "lust" here means desire. The source of all temptation is in man himself. There may be inducement to sin; but there must be some inclination, some desire for it, to give it power. If there were no desire, or appetite, for food, there would be no disposition to eat even if food were placed before us. The unrestrained man will be drawn along by his own natural propensities to sin. Power over sin in his own fleshly heart is the need of every human being.

4. The wages, or reward, of sin is not eternal life in misery, and unspeakable torture in the lake of fire; but it is death, the second death, in the "fire prepared for the devil and his angels." The righteous receive the gift of God, eternal life; the wicked, the opposite, eternal death.

5. Error is darkness. Truth is light. Ignorance of the Scriptures and of the power of God is responsible for all the error and darkness that cover the earth, whether scientific or religious.
