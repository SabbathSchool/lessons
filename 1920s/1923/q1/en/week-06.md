## Notes

1. "These things ought not so to be." That is, they must not be, they are not fitting.

2. No fountain is both sweet and bitter. Be the stream of impure water ever so small that comes into the fountain of pure water through some opening or fissure in the rock, the whole fountain is made impure. No such inconsistency is found in nature as for a fountain to send forth both fresh water and salt, and•none such should be found in the life of any individual, especially a Christian.

3. Four illustrations are given, showing the inconsistency of living such a contradictory life: (a) a fountain; (b) a fig tree • (c) a vine; (d) salt water. A fountain cannot produce sweet water and bitter; a fig tree cannot produce olive berries; a vine cannot bear figs; the sea cannot yield fresh water. Ac-cording, to the ordinary operations of nature, these things are impossible. All these illustrations are used to show the utter impossibility of depravity and virtue dwelling in the same heart, or of the love of God dwelling in the heart when hatred and malice are cherished.

4. Proud, haughty, disdainful, unholy persons may pass for great scholars, and have the reputation of being very learned; but such do not have true wisdom. This comes from above, and is revealed in a holy life.

5. That "the life is the light" is true of Christ's followers also. We are epistles known and read of men. Our words have but little weight unless they are emphasized by a con— sistent life.

6. "If ye be under the influence of an unkind, fierce, and contemptuous spirit, even while attempting or pretending to defend true religion, do not boast.... Ye have no religion, and no true wisdom; and to profess either is to lie against the truth."— Clarke.

1. Hitherto the instruction and admonitions seem to have been somewhat general. But now the application is made more personal: "Whence come wars and fightings among you." "Not public or national wars, nor yet conflicts in the courts, but rather quarrels growing out of their selfishness and uncharitableness."— Clarke.

2. "Ye have not, because ye ask not." One of the great causes of all spiritual death, and strife in homes and churches, is here pointed out. It is the lack of prayer. '

3. "The general sense is: If you prayed aright, this feel-ing of continued craving after more of worldly things would not exist. All your proper wants would be supplied; and these improper ones, which beget wars and fightings among you, would not exist"— Alford.

4. This world has its god. We cannot worship the God of heaven and the god of this world. Those who bow before the god of this world are truly the enemies of God. "How strange it is that people professing Christianity can suppose that with a worldly spirit, worldly companions„ and their lives governed by worldly maxims, they can be in favor of God, or have a place in the kingdom of heaven! When the world gets into the church, the church becomes a painted sepulcher, its spiritual vitality being extinct."— Clarke.

5. The Revised Version, margin, reads: "Or think ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain? That Spirit which He made to dwell in us yearneth for us even unto jealous envy." This rendering contains a promise of the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to resist envy.

6. "The sure way to, please God is to submit to the dis-pensations of His grace and providence; and when a man acknowledges Him in all his ways, He will direct all his steps. The covetous man grasps at the shadow and loses the sub-stance."— Clarke.
