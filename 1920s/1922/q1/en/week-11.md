## Notes

1. "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but di-vested of the personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one could then have any advan-tage because of his location or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended on high."—"The Desire of Ages," p.

2. The word "world" is here used in the same sense as the word "flesh," or "carnal heart," used in other passages of Scripture. The worldly, or carnal heart is opposed to spiritual things, and cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

4. "There are none so hardened as those who have slighted the invitation of mercy, and done despite to the Spirit of grace. The most common manifestation of the sin against the Holy Spirit, is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation to repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step to-ward the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy Spirit. "In rejecting Christ the Jewish people committed the un-pardonable sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy, we may commit the same error. We offer insult to the Prince of life, and put Him to shame before the synagogue of Satan, and before the heavenly universe, when we refuse to listen to His delegated messengers, and instead listen to the agents of Satan, who would draw the soul away from Christ. So long as one does this, he can find no hope or pardon, and he will finally lose all desire to be reconciled to God."—Id., p.
