3. These words were not spoken in sincerity, but were full of flattery and praise intended to lead Jesus to make state-ments'for which He could be condemned for either heresy or treason. But while spoken to deceive and ensnare, they bore a truthful testimony of the Saviour.

5. "The teaching of the scribes and elders was cold and formal, like a lesson learned by rote. To them the word of God possessed no vital power. Their own ideas and traditions were substituted for its teaching. In the accustomed round of service they professed to explain the law, but no inspira-tion from God stirred their own hearts or the hearts of their hearers...

His language was pure, refined, and clear as a running stream. His voice was as music to those who had listened to the monotonous tones of the rabbis. But while His teaching was simple, He spoke as one having authority. This charac-teristic set His teaching in contrast with that of all others. The rabbis spoke with doubt and hesitancy, as if the Scrip-tures might be interpreted to mean one thing or exactly the opposite. The hearers were daily involved in greater un-certainty.
