## Notes

2. Their argument, in asking for a sign that they might believe in Jesus, was this: Moses proved that he was sent from God by giving the people bread from heaven to eat; now what do you do that is greater than this to prove that you are the greater prophet, the Messiah, who will deliver us from our bondage to the Romans, as Moses delivered our fathers from the Egyptians? You have fed five thousand with five loaves from the earth for one meal. Moses fed millions for forty years with breat from heaven.

4. "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to re-ceive Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins, and that we are complete in Him. It is by beholding His love, by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in, that we are to become partakers of His nature: What food is to the body, Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit us unless we eat it; unless it becomes a part of our being. So Christ is of no value to us if we do not know. Him as a personal Saviour. A theoretical knowledge will do us no good. We must feed upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life be-comes our life. His love, His grace, must be assimilated."— "The Desire of Ages," p.

5. "By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples were still further alienated from Jesus. They were greatly displeased, and wishing to wound the Saviour, and gratify the malice of the Pharisees, they turned their backs upon Him, and left Him with disdain. They had made their choice,—had taken the form without the spirit, the husk without the kernel. Their decision was never afterward re-versed; for they walked no more with Jesus."—/d., p.
