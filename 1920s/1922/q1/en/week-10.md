## Notes

2. "It is because God is leading them that these things come upon them. Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen methods of discipline and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads the hearts of men knows their characters better than they themselves know them. He sees that some have powers and susceptibilities which, rightly directed, might be used in the advancement of His work. In His providence He brings these persons into different positions and varied circumstances that they may discover in their character the defects which have been concealed from their own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to correct these_ aofects, and to fit themselves for His service. Often He permits the fires of affliction to assail them that they may be purified."—"Ministry of Healing," p.

3. "Abiding in ChrfS't is abiding in the love of • Christ. Abiding in the love of Christ is abiding in the obedience of Christ. Duty, in other words, is the equivalent of disciple-ship. Duty conceived as the will of God and the command of Christ and faithfully fulfilled, evidences the inner union of the soul with Christ, as of the branch with the vine. 'And the great duty which He pressed on His disciples was itself the duty of unselfish brotherly love."—Speer.

4. "Abiding in Christ is not a question of a little more or little better fruit; for 'without Me,' or 'apart from Me,' ye can do, not little, but 'nothing.' The question is of much fruit, or of none at all."—J. Hudson Taylor. "Ye can no more produce a virtue without the Vine than can a barbed wire fence grow luscious grapes. All the vigor, verdure, luxuriance, graces, goodness that we possess have come to us because the life of Christ has been flowing through His followers."—Peloubet.
