## Notes

1. The single, clear eye gives correct ideas. The perverted eye distorts all outward things to the dark body. So, if our spiritual vision is single (seeking only God's glory), His light will flood the soul and enlighten the dark body. But if this vision is perverted by sin and selfishness, it will further per-vert the naturally base passions.

2. The injunction is not an excuse for laziness, shiftless-ness, thoughtlessness. "Take no anxious thought," is the idea of the text. God demands prudence, industry, care, in His service; but having done your duty in His fear and by His grace, do not worry. Leave the results to Him.

3. "All who have chosen God's service are to rest in His care. Christ pointed to the birds flying in the heavens, to the flowers of the field, and bade His hearers consider these ob-jects of God's creation. 'Are ye not of much more value than they?' He said. The measure of divine attention bestowed on any object is proportionate to its rank in the scale of being. 'The little brown sparrow is watched over by Providence. The flowers of the field, the grass that carpets the earth, share the notice and care of our heavenly Father. The great Master Artist has taken thought for the lilies, making them so beauti-ful that they outshine the glory of. Solomon. How much more does He care for man, who is the image and glory of God. He longs to see His children reveal a character after His simili-tude. As the sunbeam imparts to the flowers their varied and delicate tints, so does God impart to the soul the beauty of His own character."—"The Desire of Ages," p.

5. We should be careful that we do not put ourselves in the place of God by passing judgment upon one another.,
