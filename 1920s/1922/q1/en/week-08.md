## Notes

2. The shepherd "depends upon the sheep to follow, and they in turn expect him never to leave them. They run after him if he appears to be escaping from them, and are terrified when he is out of sight, or any stranger appears instead of him. He calls them from time to time to let them know that he is at hand. The sheep listen and continue grazing, but if anyone else tries to produce the same peculiar cries and gut-tural sounds, they look around with a startled air and begin to scatter."â€”Mackie..

3. Christ said He was the "door of the sheep" because He was thinking of His individual followers, the sheep, rather than of the fold, His church. In this parable, He also speaks of Himself as the door of the fold; but He would have us feel that individually we are thought of and cared for.

4. Beneath the burning skies and the clear, starry nights of Palestine there grows up between the shepherd and his flock a union of attachment and tenderness. In that country, at an unexpected moment. sheep are liable to be swept away by some mountain torrent, or carried off by hill robbers, or torn by wolves. At any moment, their protector may have to save their lives by personal hazard.
