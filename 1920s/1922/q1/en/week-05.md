## Notes

1. "Ask," "seek," "knock." Be in earnest. Many pause on the very threshold of blessing and deliverance. God does not wish to see His children in need, and if we will but place our needs before Him and ask for help, He will help us.

3. "Strait" is used in the sense of "narrow" in both verses. The gate does not open to the pilgrim laden with selfishness, worldliness, riches, sin. All these must be left without. As long as we cling to such things, we cannot enter the narrow gate, whatever we may profess to the contrary.

14. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that faith in Christ leads to cleansing from sin, clean living, and righteous doing.
