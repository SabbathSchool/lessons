## Notes

1. "In the sermon on the mount, He [Christ] sought to undo the work that had been wrought by false education, and to give His hearers a right conception of His kingdom and of His own character.... Without combating their ideas of the kingdom of God, He told them the conditions of entrance therein, leaving them to draw their own conclusions as to its nature. The truths He taught are no less important to us than to the multitude that followed Him. We no less than they need to learn the foundation principles of the kingdom of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p.

2. The terns "Beatitudes," by which we designate the nine "blesseds" of this chapter, comes from the Latin beati, the word with which these verses begin in that version. Jesus does not say "happy," but "blessed." There is a difference. Happiness may depend upon surroundings and circumstances, but blessedness depends on relationship to God. We should bear in mind that these "blesseds" are not pronounced alone upon those already possessing these virtues, but also upon those who, by grace, may acquire them. Luke says, "Blessed are ye poor"—poor in this world's goods, but possessing God, and growing in grace and knowledge in Him. Such are in-deed blessed.

4. Hunger and thirst are the normal manifestations of physical health. These strong feelings are used to illustrate the eager desire the soul should have for righteousness. "The invalid loses desire for food, but with returning health begins to desire and enjoy it. So it is also in the moral and spiritual realm. Hunger for the highest, for the best and truest life, is itself a sign of saving relationship with God. The man who has no hunger, and is conscious of no needs, has neither knowledge of himself nor of God."—Id.

5. Peacemakers should not wait until contending parties resort to open conflict. It is well to discern early the causes that lead up to an open break, and take steps to avert the trouble. We may be peacemakers in name, but at the, same time possess dispositions that are the source of constant strife and turmoil. A 'quarrelsome, fretful, faultfinding, criticizing, gossiping disposition is not calculated to bring the blessing in store for peacemakers.

6. "I have often seen just such salt, and the identical disposition of it that our Lord has mentioned. A merchant of Sidon having farmed of the government the revenue from the importation of salt, brought over an immense quantity from the marshes of Cyprus.... This he had transferred to the mountains, to cheat the government out of some small percentage. Sixty-five houses... were. rented and filled with-salt. These houses have merely earthen floors, and the salt next to the ground, in a few years, entirely spoiled. I saw large quantities of it literally thrown into the street, to be trodden underfoot of men and beasts.... It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown; and this is the reason why it is cast into the street.... There is no place about the house, yard, or garden where it can be tolerated. No man will allow it to be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street; and there it is cast, to be trodden underfoot of men."— W. M. Thompson, in "The Land and the Book."
