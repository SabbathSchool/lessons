It was His joy that all His humiliation and suffering would glorify the Father's name. To, this He first directs the thoughts of His disciples."—"The Desire of Ages," p.

2. This commandment here called "new" was really an old commandment which we had from the beginning. It was new in the sense in which we sometimes speak of receiving some new light, or truth, from the Bible—truth which has been there ever since the Word was written, but is new to us, we having never seen it before. This commandment was new to the disciples in that they had never learned to do it.

5. "By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work would be of a more exalted character than His, but that it would have greater extent. He did' not refer merely to miracle-working, but to all that would take place under the working of the Holy Spirit."—Id., p.
