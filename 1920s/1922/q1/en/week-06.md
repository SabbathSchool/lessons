## Notes

3. The Samaritans in Consequence built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim. Strong enmity sprang up. Greater holiness was claimed for Mount Gerizim than for Jerusalem; the Samaritans accused the Jews of corrupting God's word. On the other hand, the Jews called the Samaritans Cuthites, and forbade all intercourse with them; to receive one into the house was thought to bring down the curse of God.

2. Note how carefully the Saviour led the mind of the woman, not only to confess, voluntarily her sinfulness, but to ask questions for the enlightenment of her darkened mind. He precipitated nothing, but let her open the way for the line of truth she sought to receive. "The Syriac Codex implies that Jesus rose and stood to meet politely the standing woman, and this standing was one thing that caused His disciples to marvel."—Peloubet.
