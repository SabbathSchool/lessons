## Notes

4. He fulfilled the prophecies re-lating to His first advent. Eternity alone can fulfill all the prophecies, for some of them prophesy of the eternal kingdom of God.

2. A "jot" (the Hebrew letter yod, answering to our letter i) is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet. A "tittle" is a point that serves to distinguish one letter from another, as the difference between our capital E and F. Some Hebrew letters are much more alike, and the absence or presence of the distinguishing point would make great dif-ference in the meaning. God's law could not be changed in one jot or tittle till heaven and earth should pass away; and "the earth abideth forever."

4. The nature of God's law, and its meaning, have never changed. The meaning which Christ caused to stand out with clear emphasis was in the law as 'spoken from Mount Sinai. But the traditions of its teachers had covered up the true meaning. Christ purposed to take away this false interpre-tation, and cause the law to stand out in its true interpre-tation.

7. "Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the judicial oath, in which God is solemnly called to witness that what is said is truth, and nothing but the truth. Jesus Him-self, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to tes-tify under oath.... If there is any one who can consistently testify under oath, it is the Christian.""—Id., p.

2. Study well the instruction of our Saviour, and the prayers recorded in the Scripture. This passage does not forbid public prayer; for our Lord prayed in public, as did His servants. Public prayers, should on all ordinary occasions be short. Let the long prayers be in secret. Come to God with humility, with a sense of utter unworthiness, and of His holiness and mercy. Thank Him for His goodness. Praise Him for His love and mercy. Ask in simple faith as we need, but always according to His will. Do not often repeat the name or titles of Deity, nor speak to the great God as you would to your human neighbor. Holy reverence becomes the Christian; and this is fitting to the most implicit faith.

3. A story is told of a knight in olden times who went to an aged pastor to ask his blessing before he went to avenge himself on his enemy. The pastor said, "Son, on one condi-tion I bestow my blessing; kneel and pray with all thy heart our Lord's prayer after me." The knight did so until he came to the petition for forgiveness, and then paused. The good man bade him continue. The knight said he could not. "Then," said the aged man, "I cannot bestow my blessing." Again and again the old man repeated the prayer, and the knight followed him until he came to that petition. Finally the words broke his heart, and he followed the prayer clear through. "Now, my son," said his counselor, "I will bless thee on thy mission." have none," replied the knight; "I have no enemy to avenge."

4. "Anoint thine head, and wash thy face,—these were forbidden in the Jewish canon on days of fasting and humilia-tion; and hypocrites availed themselves of this ordinance that they might appear to fast. Our Lord, therefore, cautions us against this; as if He had said, Ar. iothing, dress in any ordinary manner, and let the whole of thy deportment prove that thou desirest to recommend thy soul to God, and not thy face to men."—Clarke. Money is of no more value than sand, only as it• is put to use in providing for the necessities of life, in blessing others, and advancing the cause of Christ."—"Christ's Object Les-sons," p..
