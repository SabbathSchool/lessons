14. CHRIST THE POWER FOR A NEW LIFE

3. "Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them. 'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? — Not one.' • 'Tile carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.'

They may produce an out-ward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they can-not purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to. holiness. That power is Christ.. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—"Steps to Christ," page

If by your schol-arship you so make to live again the classic scenes in which the Nazarene moved and taught that I am made painfully conscious of the long centuries that intervening divide Him from me; then all the more, if you would se-cure the abiding of my faith in Him, you must let me see how He can still reach me, and stand for me."— Q. loted in "Christianity Is Christ," page
