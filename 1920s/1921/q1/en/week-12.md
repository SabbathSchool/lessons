4. "Christ is the sum of all Christian teaching; and, where the message of His love is welcomed, He Himself comes in spiritual and real presence, and dwells in the spirit."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Colossians), page

178. THE PURPOSE OF THE RECORD

5. "Let it be remembered that the study of the testimony is one thing, and the enjoyment of the salvation is another, and that the record of the things which Jesus did and said has attained its end with those only, who, believing, have life through His name."—"The Progress of Doctrine," page

81. A PECULIARITY OP CHRISTIANITY

6. "One peculiarity of Christianity is that you cannot take its message, and put aside Christ, the speaker of the message, as you may do with all men's teachings... His person is inextricably intertwined with His teach-ing, for a very large part of His teaching is exclusively concerned with, and all of it centers in, Himself. He is not only true, but He is the truth. His message is, not only what He said with His lips about God and man, but also what He said about Himself, and what He did in His life, death, and resurrection."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Colossians), page
