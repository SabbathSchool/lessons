## Notes

2. We meet with Jesus in the first verse of the New Testament, and we do not take our leave of Him until we come to the last verse. His person is the theme of every book. "The Christian revelation is not a mere message about God, it is h, unveiling of God." "The person of Christ is the explanation of Christianity." THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF CHRISTIANITY.

3. "Christianity is the only religion in the world which rests on the person of its founder. A man can be a faithful Mohammedan without in the least concerning himself with the person of Mohammed. So also a man can be a true and faithful Buddhist without knowing anything what-ever about Buddha. It is quite different with Christianity. Christianity is so inextricably bound up with Christ that our view of the person of Christ involves and determines our view of Christianity." THE ESSENTIAL TRUTHS

4. "Christ crucified, Christ risen, Christ ascended into the heavens, Christ coming again, should so soften, gladden, and fill the mind of the minister that he will present these truths to the people in love and deep earnestness." -"Gospel Workers," page
