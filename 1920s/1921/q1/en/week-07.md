## Notes

2. "To believe in Jesus Christ is to do something more than think about Him and have an opinion concerning Him. It means to bow before Him-in reverence; to take Him at His word; to do His will; to begin walking in His way; to make the great surrender; to accept His teaching as though it were true, and prove by practicing it. The man who so deals with Christ is the man who in the end finds out His secret, and is able to say, 'My Lord and my God.' "â€”"Aspects of Christ," page
