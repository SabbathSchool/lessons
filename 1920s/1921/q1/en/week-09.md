## Notes

1. "The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims. Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem fallen man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony with heaven. Christ would take upon Himself the guilt and shame of sin,— sin so offensive to a holy God that it must separate the Father and His Son. Christ would reach to the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race."— "Patriarchs and Prophets," page

68. MAN'S NEED SUPPLIED IN CHRIST

2. "The need of man, in one word, was mediation; the work of Christ is that' of Mediator. The life of man, as a spiritual being, is, from first to last, a mediated life, a life mediated through the incarnate Son of God."— "The Incarnation," page

39. THE MEDIATING WORD •

3. "He is called the Word of God as mediating between the Father•and all creatures; bringing them into being, fashioning them, giving the world its laws, imparting reason and conscience to creatures of a higher order, and revealing to them in due season the knowledge of 'tod's will."—"The One Mediator," page

21. MEDIATION AND THE NAME

4. "The emphasis placed on 'the name of Jesus Christ,' and on His work, as Saviour from sin, can be satisfactorily explained only in the light of His mediatorial office and work as set forth in other scriptures."—"The Media-tion of Jesus Christ," page

95. HUMANITY AND DIVINITY IN CHRIST'S MEDIATION

134. • ' THE ETERNAL MEDIATOR

6. "Just as we believe that a strictly mediatorial work and function be-longs to the Son of God in His divine nature, in respect of His general sovereign relation to the universe, in its origination and in its continuance and administration (and this apart from the special work of redemption), so we believe that, in the special work of redemption, His gracious interest in and intervention for His creature man is not to be restricted, if we would rightly understand it in its due connection and place, to the period since His actual incarnation. Rather is that the climax of a long course of previous visitations and dispensations of mercy."—"The. One Mediator," page

40. A CONTINUOUS MEDIATOR

8. "In the Old Testanient the principle [of mediation] is given in divers Portions and in divers manners, but in the New Testament, it converges in the doctrine of the person and work of the one final Mediator, the Son of God. Amid all the rich diversity of the various parts of the New Testa-ment, there is one fundamental conception common to all, that of Christ as at once the interpreter of God to men and the door of access for men to God."—"The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia," page
