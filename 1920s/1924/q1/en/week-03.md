## Notes

1. "Through the Jewish nation it was God's purpose to im-part rich blessings to all peoples. Through Israel the way was to be prepared for the diffusion of His light to the whole world. The nations of the world, through following corrupt practices, had lost the knowledge of God. Yet in His mercy God did not blot them out of existence. He purposed to give them opportunity for becoming acquainted with Him through His church.... It was for the accomplishment of this pur-pose that God called Abraham out from his idolatrous kin-dred, and bade him dwell in the land of Canaan."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p.

2. To give te invitation, "Come," has ever been the great business of Christ and His followers. We are still "journey-ing"; soon the heavenly Canaan will be reached; "the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel;" and by every available means, the "good tidings" are to be proclaimed in every land. "Christ will perform wonderful miracles if men will but do their God-given part. In human hearts to-day as great a transformation may be wrought as has ever been wrought in generations past. John Bunyan was redeemed from pro-fanity and reveling, John Newton from slave-dealing, to proclaim an uplifted Saviour. A Bunyan and a Newton may be redeemed from among men to-day."— Id., p.

4. Had Israel lived up to their high privileges, many be-lievers would have been raised up to the praise of Jehovah in Egypt, Assyria, and other lands.

35. What an incentive, too, it should have been for the Jews to seek other jewels from among the heathen!

7. As Israel failed to send abroad the gosper that saves, heathenism itself turned upon the chosen people and threat-ened to engulf them. For all this, " 'the Lord brought Judah low' because of continued transgression. In this time of chas-tisement, Ahaz, instead of repenting, trespassed 'yet more against the Lord:... for he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus.' Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,' he said, 'therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me.' "As the apostate king neared the end of his reign, he caused the doors of the temple to be closed. The sacred services were interrupted. No longer were the candlesticks kept burning before the altar. No longer were offerings made for the sins of the people. No longer did sweet incense ascend on high at the time of the morning and the evening sacrifice. Deserting the courts of the house of God, and lock-ing fast its doors, the inhabitants of the godless city boldly set up altars for the worship of heathen deities on the street corners throughout Jerusalem. Heathenism had seemingly triumphed; the powers of darkness had well-nigh prevailed." — Id., p.
