## Notes

1. By their transgression, our first parents lost for them-selves and their posterity the divine image, forfeited their right to eternal life, and surrendered their charter to the rulership of this world. The great Missionary came to re-store everything that had been lost through apostasy; and His victorious life, death, and resurrection insured the com-plete success of the glorious enterprise.

4. "By beholding we become changed;" by viewing the portrait of Jesus as revealed in the Word, we become "like Him" in thinking, in working, in doing; by meditation upon His incomparable sacrifice, we too are impelled to give our lives in unselfish ministry. But the complete unfolding of that love will be reserved as the theme and delight of the saved throughout eternity.

5. "Christ feels the woes of every sufferer. When evil spirits rend a human frame, Christ feels the curse. When fever is burning up the life current, He feels the agony. And He is just as willing to heal the sick now, as when He was personally on earth."— Id., p.

6. "The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. It is a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of sav-ing souls depends alone on the ordained minister. All to whom the heavenly inspiration has come, are put in trust with the gospel. All who receive the life of Christ are or-dained to work for the salvation of their fellow men." — Id., p.

7. "The Saviour does not bid the disciples labor to bear fruit. He tells them to abide in Him.... The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as in Him. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of Christ." — Id., p.
