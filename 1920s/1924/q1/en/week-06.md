3. "The Spirit is to use us. Through the Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do of His good pleasure.' But many will not submit to this. They want to manage them-selves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train." "The Desire of Ages," p.

5. "In causing the destruction of the swine, it was Satan's purpose to turn the people away from the Saviour, and pre-vent the preaching of the gospel in that region. But this very occurrence roused the whole country as nothing else could have done, and directed attention to Christ. Though the Saviour Himself departed, the men whom He had healed, remained as witnesses to His power. Those who had been mediums of the prince of darkness, became channels of light, messengers of the Son of God. Men marveled as they listened to the wondrous news. A door was opened to the gos-pel throughout that region. When Jesus returned to De-capolis, the people flocked about Him, and for three days, not merely the inhabitants of one town, but thousands from all the surrounding region, heard the message of salvation."—"The Desire of Ages," p.

19. "With the consecrated worker for God, in whatever place he may be, the Holy Spirit abides. The words spoken to the disciples are spoken also to us. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs. The Spirit furnishes the strength that sustains striving, wrestling souls in every emergency, amidst the hatred of the world, and the realization of their own failures and mistakes. In sorrow and affliction, when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel helpless and alone,— these are the times when, in answer to the prayer of faith, the Holy Spirit brings comfort to the heart."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p.

1. "He [Paul] was regarded by the rabbis as a young man of great promise, and high hopes were cherished concerning him as an able and zealous defender of the ancient faith. His elevation to membership in the Sanhedrim council placed him in a position of power."-"The Acts of the Apostles," p.

4. "The consecrated messengers who in the early days of Christianity carried to a perishing world the glad tidings of salvation, allowed no thought of self-exaltation to mar their presentation of Christ and Him crucified. They coveted neither authority nor preeminence. Hiding self in the Sav-iour, they exalted the great plan of salvation, and the life of Christ, the author and finisher of this plan. Christ, the same • yesterday, to-day, and forever, was the burden of their teaching. "If those who to-day are teaching the word of God, would uplift the cross of Christ higher and still higher, their min-istry would be far more successful. If sinners can be led to give one earnest look at the cross, if they can obtain a full view of the crucified Saviour, they will realize the depth of God's compassion and the sinfulnessof sin."— Id., p.

5. "He [Paul] illustrated in a practical way what might be done by consecrated laymen in many places where the people were unacquainted with the truths of the gospel. His course inspired many humble toilers with a desire to do what they could to advance the cause of God, while at the same time they supported themselves in daily labor."— Id., p.

6. "For some time Paul had been carrying a burden of soul for the churches,— a burden so heavy that he could scarcely endure it. False teachers had sought to destroy his influence among the believers, and to urge their own doctrines in the place of gospel truth. The perplexities and discourage-ments with which Paul was surrounded are revealed in the words, 'We were pressed out of measure, above strength, in-somuch that we despaired even of life.' "—Id., p.
