## Notes

7. What message was preached to Abraham? Ga

1. "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revela-tion of 'the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal.' It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man throygh the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency."—"The Desire of Ages," p.

3. "Since the announcement to the serpent in Eden, 'I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed,' Satan had known that he did not hold absolute sway over the world. There was seen in men the working of a power that withstood his dominion."— Id., p.

115. This promise to Adam and Eve contained the entire plan for man's restoration.

5. "The Lord condescended to enter into a covenant with His servant, employing such forms as were customary among men for the ratification of a solemn engagement. By divine direction, Abraham sacrificed a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram, each three years old, dividing the bodies, and laying the pieces a little distance apart.... The plan of redemption was here opened to him, in the death of Christ, the great sacrifice, and His coming in glory. Abraham saw also the earth restored to its Eden beauty, to be given him for an everlasting posses-sion, as the final and complete fulfillment of the promise. "As a pledge of this covenant of God with men, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp, symbols of the divine presence, passed between the severed victims, totally consuming them." —"Patriarchs and Prophets," p.

6. "Abraham, 'the friend of God,' set us worthy example. His was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his altar, calling all within his encamp-ment to the morning and the evening sacrifice. When his tent was removed, the altar remained. In following years, there were those among the roving Canaanites who received instruction from Abraham; and whenever one of these came to that altar, he knew who had been there before him; and when he had pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and there worshiped the living God."— Id., p.
