## Notes

1. "In this vision the two olive trees which stand before God are represented as emptying the golden oil out of them-selves through golden tubes into the bowl of the candlestick. From this the lamps of the sanctuary are fed, that they may give a bright, continuous light. So from the anointed ones that stand in God's presence the fullness of divine light and love and power is imparted to His people, that they may im-part to others light and joy and refreshing."—"Prophets and Kings," p.

594. "The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament. Both are _important testimonies to the origin and perpetuity of the law of God. Both are wit-nesses also to the plan of salvation. The types, sacrifices, and prophecies of the Old Testament point forward to a Saviour to come. The Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament tell of a Saviour who has come in the exact manner foretold by type and prophecy."—"The Great Controversy," p.

229. Kings, nobles, and priests united in a solemn oath to "ex-tirpate heresy." The publication of the Scriptures was for-bidden, and thousands of innocent victims were burned at the stake or put to death with nameless cruelty.

3. "When France rejected the gift of Heaven, she sowed the seeds of anarchy and ruin; and the inevitable outworking of cause and effect resulted in the Revolution and the Reign of Terror."— Id., p.

230. "Unhappy France reaped in blood the harvest she had sown." In the Reign of Terror, violence and lust held undis-puted sway. The execution of king and queen, nobles and priests, was incited by a maddened communism. Bibles were publicly burned, the weekly Sabbath abolished, death de-clared an eternal sleep, and a dissolute woman worshiped as the Goddess of Reason. Without the keeping power of God's word, France found herself submerged in the licentiousness of Sodom and the darkness of Egypt.

5. While a spiritual paralysis seemed to have stupefied the popular churches of Christendom, there were during the eighteenth century some illustrious exceptions, among whom were the Moravian missionaries. John Wesley "for a short time abode with the Moravians, and was deeply impressed with their Christian deportment. Of one of their religious services, in striking contrast to the lifeless formalism of the Church of England, he wrote: 'The great simplicity as well as solemnity of the whole almost made me forget the seventeen hundred years between, and imagine myself in one of those assemblies where form and state were not; but Paul, the tent-maker, or Peter, the fisherman, presided; yet with the demon-stration of the Spirit and of power.' "—"The Great Contro-versy," p.
