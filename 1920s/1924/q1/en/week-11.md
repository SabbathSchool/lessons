MARCH 22, 1924

## Questions

2. Like his Master, what will the true missionary say? 

## Notes

2. Foreign missions exact a heavy toll in financial output, labors, separations, broken ties, privations, failing health, and sometimes life itself. But while the missionary enterprise costs, it also pays. The heathen who has forsaken his super-stition and fears, to become a new creature in Jesus Christ, will look up with glowing, thankful face, and tell you that the undertaking pays. The humble laborer who has toiled hard on his farm or in his shop, and has been self-denying that he may give generously to the work of God, ever testifies that the triumphs of the cross more than repay him. The person who has left the comforts and associations of his native land to turn the heathen from idolatry to the living God, will tell you that in true joy and satisfaction, no other pursuit in this world yields so heavy a dividend. And the angels in their songs on high affirm in melody and praise that the priceless Gift of heaven, and all the sacrifices of earth, are none too precious for the redemption of the lost.

4. On one occasion, the young disciple Mark, being unused to hardships, and disheartened by the perils and privations of the way, deserted the mission field. Later, however, he acquired experience in the mission school of endurance, and was recommended by Paul as "profitable" to him "for the ministry."

5. In the transformation of character, the casting out of evil passions, the development of the sweet graces of God's Holy Spirit, we may see the fulfillment in our personal ex-perience of the promise, "Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree." It is our privilege to see our life's desert "rejoice, and blossom as the rose."

331. Why not make the Thirteenth Sabbath a "squaring up" day for the quarter? The Sabbath schools are expected to raise one half the sixty cents a week. Why not square up? Why not keep square?
