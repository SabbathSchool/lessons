## Notes

2. "The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His peo-ple.... Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His church."— Id., p.

3. "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet men, and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the supremacy, they came close to-gether in Christian fellowship.... "These days of preparation were days of deep heart-searching. The disciples felt their spiritual need, and cried to the Lord for the holy unction that was to fit them for the work of soul-saving. They did not ask for a blessing for them-selves merely. They were weighted with the burden of the salvation of souls. They realized that the gospel was to be carried to the world, and they claimed the power that Christ had promised."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p.

4. "The lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ's parting promise to send the Holy Spirit as His representative. It is not because of any restriction on the part of God that the riches of His grace do not flow earthward to men. If the ful-fillment of the promise is not seen as it might be, it is because, the promise is not appreciated as it should be. If all were willing, all would be filled with the Spirit. Wherever the need of the Holy Spirit is a matter little thought of, there is seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual de-clension and death."— Id., p.

6. "Learning, talents, eloquence, every natural or ac-quired endowment, may be possessed; but without the pres-ence of the Spirit of God, no heart will be touched, no sinner be won to Christ. On the other hand, if they are connected with Christ, if the gifts of the Spirit are theirs, the poorest and most ignorant of His disciples will have a power that will tell upon hearts."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p.
