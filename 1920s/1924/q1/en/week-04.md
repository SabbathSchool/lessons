## Questions

2. What unusual missionary opportunity was afforded him? 

## Notes

1. "The visit of these messengers from the ruler of a far-away land gave Hezekiah an opportunity to extol the living God. How easy it would have been for him to tell them of God, the upholder of all created things, through whose favor his own life had been spared when all other hope had fled! What momentous transformations might have taken place had these seekers after truth from the plains of Chaldea been led to acknowledge the supreme sovereignty of the living God!"—"Prophets and Kings," p.

2. The king did what any other worldly monarch might have done under like circumstances; but "had Hezekiah im-proved the opportunity given him to bear witness to the power, the goodness, the compassion, of the God of Israel, the report of the ambassadors would have been as light piercing dark-ness. But he magnified himself above the Lord of hosts. He `rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up.' Id., p.

29. "Every day of life is freighted with responsibilities which we must bear. Every day, our words and acts are making impressions upon those with whom we associate. How great the need that we set a watch upon our lips and guard care-fully our steps! One reckless movement, one imprudent step, and the surging waves of some strong temptation may sweep a soul into the downward path. We can not gather up the thoughts we have planted in human minds. If they have been evil, we may have set in motion a train of circumsitances, a tide of evil, which we are powerless to stay. "On the other hand, if by our example we aid others in the development of good principles, we give them power to do good. In their turn they exert the same beneficial influ-ence over others. Thus hundreds and thousands are helped by our unconscious influence. The true follower of Christ strengthens the good purposes of all with whom he comes in contact. Before an unbelieving, sin-loving world, he reveals the power of God's grace and the perfection of His character." — Id., p.

4. Kings and priests for God had alike neglected the op-portunities of enlightening the peoples of the Euphrates valley. Now He sends His missionaries to Babylon in the guise of captives. "In the land of their captivity these men were to carry out God's purpose by giving to heathen nations the blessings that come through a knowledge of Jehovah. They were to be His representatives."— Id., p.

5. "The once proud monarch had become a humble child of God; the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise and compas-sionate king. He who had defied and blasphemed the God of heaven, now acknowledged the power of the Most High, and earnestly sought to promote the fear of Jehovah and the happiness of his subjects. Under the rebuke of Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned at last the lesson which all rulers need to learn,— that true greatness consists in true goodness."— Id., p.

7. So long had Jewish zeal been centered upon hoarding for itself the blessings of heaven, so long had Hebrew piety devoted itself to the ceremony and letter of a lifeless creed, that even the thought of true missionary labor for the Gen-tiles filled their hearts with nameless rage.
