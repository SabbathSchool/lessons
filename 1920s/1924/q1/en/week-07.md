## Notes

36. How eminently fitting that in the gospel dispensation, the church should be typified by seven lamps of fire ordained consecutively to light the pilgrims' pathway between the first and second advents!

3. The definition of the word "Ephesus" is "desirable," which may be taken as a term descriptive of the character of the early church. Those early Christians had received the doctrine of Christ in its purity. They enjoyed the benefits and blessings of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. They were noted for works, labor, and patience. In faithfulness to the pure principles taught by Christ, they could not bear those that were evil, and they tried false apostles, searched out their true characters, and found them liars.

5. Most noticeable is the transition in the appearance of the horses from the state indicating church purity to that which signifies a lifeless Christianity. During the latter por-tion of this period, history records but the most meager mis-sionary operations. However, no age was left wholly without witnesses for the gospel.

6. The well-nigh impregnable Piedmont valleys afforded the Waldensian Christians a providential retreat from the hostilities and terrors of Rome. Here in simple faith they worshiped God, conducted their schools, and commissioned their missionaries. The home of the Albigenses in south-western France was another portion of the "wilderness" where "the woman" found a shelter; while a few centuries later, the newly discovered American continent provided an asylum for thousands of the oppressed and persecuted. The Hussite nobles successfully defended their faith in Bohemia; and a century later the Protestant princes of Germany threw off the papal yoke. Afterwards, when their cause seemed lost, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden came to their aid and helped save the day for Protestantism. A little later the Netherlands and England dissolved their allegiance with Rome; thus "the earth helped the woman," and "opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth." Nearly the half of Europe was opened to evangelical teaching and influence.
