<h2>TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE MESSAGE</h2>
<p>FOR SENIOR CLASSES                               SECOND QUARTER, 1905</p>
<p>PUBLISHED BY THE
PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA</p>
<p>[Entered as second-class matter October 13, 1904, at the Post-office at Mountain View, Cal., under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1879.]</p>
<p>No. 40       Mountain View, California, April, 1905       Price, 5c each
                                                           20 cents per year</p>
<h2>The Conflict Between Capital and Labor</h2>
<p>This new book, by E. T. Russell, treats upon a subject concerning which every one should become intelligent. The various organizations are reaching out and rapidly embracing all classes of people, trades and professions, and sooner or later we must meet the question face to face. Then we must know where to stand and how to stand.</p>
<p>The author candidly considers both sides of this great question, setting forth not only facts and figures, but divinely revealed principles to guide us right. A good book for your friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>Price only 50 cents</p>
<h2>The Vegetarian Cook Book</h2>
<p>For those who are looking for a better dietary than can be prepared from the flesh of animals, which is very liable to be contaminated with tuberculosis and various other diseases, we most heartily recommend this book. It contains a large number of thoroughly tested recipes of healthful, hygienic dishes, and is so systematically arranged that any one may be easily referred to.</p>
<p>The book is the product of practical experience and observation gleaned by Mr. E. G. Fulton, as manager of the Vegetarian Cafe, San Francisco.</p>
<p>265 Pages Price, 75 cents</p>
<h2>Healthful Living</h2>
<p>This is a book compiled from the writings of Mrs. E. G. White, giving in concise form a vast fund of instruction and information on the fundamental principles of health reform. More than a score of her works, as well as much unpublished manuscript, have been consulted in the production of this book, and the matter brought together and arranged in convenient form for ready reference.</p>
<p>The book contains 324 pages, divided into 42 chapters. It is thoroughly indexed, giving every Scripture text referred to, as well as subjects treated, also a general index referring to paragraphs.</p>
<p>Cloth Bound Price, 50 cents</p>

                <p>1. God did not purpose to perpetuate sin throughout eternity, therefore when man sinned he was shut away from the tree of life. None of the human family has ever passed this cherubim and flaming sword sent to guard the way to the tree of life, so there is not an immortal sinner on earth.</p><p>2. The words from which "soul," "spirit," etc., are translated occur some seventeen hundred times in their different forms in the Bible; but not in a single instance do we find it stated that the soul is immortal, or never-dying. Immortality is an attribute inherent only with God, who dwells in light unapproachable.</p><p>3. Note that it is through the Gospel that both life and immortality are brought to light. We are exhorted to lay hold of life. 1 Tim. 6:12. The believer has life now through faith. John 3:36. But the life we receive by faith we retain by faith. If we lose our faith, we lose this life also. The gift of immortality will be bestowed upon the overcomer at the resurrection of the just.</p><p>4. The mission of Christ to this earth was to bring life to man, who, by reason of transgression, had been shut away from the tree of life. He offers to become a tree of life to all who will believe. Nothing could more effectually rob the Son of God of His glory than to teach that man possesses by nature an immortal soul, and is capable of an eternal existence independent of faith in a Redeemer. Were this so, the mission of Christ to give life would have been in vain.</p>

                <p>1. The Lord warned man that the penalty for sin was death. Satan plainly contradicted the word of God by stating that man would not die, but be "as God, knowing good and evil." The doctrine therefore of consciousness in death has its origin wholly from this declaration of Satan in Eden. To make good his statement, "Ye shall not die," he has filled the world with the false idea of an immortal soul which survives the stroke of death, and continues to live separate from the body.</p><p>2. The statement concerning Abraham that he was "gathered to his people" could not mean that he went to be with them in a conscious state of existence, for his ancestors were all idolaters. Josh. 24:2.</p><p>3. At creation, the Lord breathed into the man whom He had made the breath of life. In death the process is reversed. The Lord takes from every living creature that which was given at creation, viz., the breath, and death results. Ps. 104:29. But that which the Lord takes from man at death was not a conscious entity prior to the time man received it; neither is it after death.</p>

                <p>1. This promise is one Jesus has sent back to death-stricken humanity since He ascended to the throne of His Father. How comforting the thought that though Satan may lock our loved one within the portals of his prison-house, the tomb, the key is in the hands of our Redeemer. Jesus went into the stronghold of the enemy and conquered, bringing in triumph from the tomb the key of death, and thus assuring deliverance to every believing captive.</p><p>2. The first resurrection is that of the just, the holy and righteous only. None of the wicked dead will have a part in this resurrection. They live in the second resurrection.</p><p>3. Eze. 37:1-14 should be studied in connection with this subject. While this scripture perhaps primarily applies to the condition of ancient Israel, it is no doubt also a portrayal of the final resurrection of the righteous.</p><p>4. "Caught up to meet the Lord in the air." In life, angels ever attend God's people. Ps. 34:7. When the Lord comes, all the holy angels will come with Him. His voice will pierce the silent tomb and awake to immortality the righteous dead. As they come from their dusty beds, the angels will "gather" them for the garner on high. How glorious indeed will it be to be "caught up" by an angel escort to meet the Life-giver in the air. This is the Christian's hope.</p><p>5. "Then Jesus and all the retinue of holy angels, and all the redeemed saints, left the city. The angels surrounded their Commander, and escorted Him on His way, and the train of redeemed saints followed. Then, in terrible, fearful majesty, Jesus called forth the wicked dead; and they came up with the same feeble, sickly bodies that went into the grave. What a spectacle! What a scene! At the first resurrection all came forth in immortal bloom; but at the second the marks of the curse are visible on all."—Early Writings, page 151.</p>

                <p>1. The wicked are "alienated" from the life of God, and, consequently, without hope. Having chosen death, their names have no place in the "book of life." The life of God is eternal, and this is the life upon which all are earnestly exhorted to lay hold of by faith. 1 Tim. 6:12.</p><p>2. The fire which consumed the cities of the plains is said to be "eternal," not because burning forever, but because its effects are eternal. It wrought an everlasting destruction upon these cities. They will appear no more forever.</p><p>3. In the burning of the "fat of lambs," in connection with the sanctuary service, the children of Israel had an object lesson of what will be the final end of sin.</p><p>4. The wicked are not now being punished. They will not receive their reward until after the final, investigative judgment. At the close of the 1,000 years, they will receive the wages of sin which they have chosen. A careful study of the services connected with the cleansing of the sanctuary, and the placing of sin upon the head of the scapegoat, will shed much light upon the question of when sinners will receive their reward. See Leviticus 16.</p><p>5. There will not exist throughout the unnumbered ages of eternity a seething lake of fire and brimstone in which millions of lost souls will suffer unspeakable torture and blaspheme God forever. No such terrible blot will remain to mar the handiwork of God. The lost will receive that which they have chosen—death. Every rebel voice will be stilled in the realms of the second death, and not a discordant note be heard through the eternal ages to mar the universal harmony of heaven.</p>

            <p>Note—From the Scripture studied in previous lessons, it is very clear that man is mortal. Being shut away from the tree of life, and alienated from the life of God, his only hope rests in the resurrection of the dead, and the gift of immortality when the Life-giver comes. This is the united testimony of the Bible. There are a few texts, however, which, to the casual student, may seem to conflict with the general tenor of inspiration. One lesson is devoted to a study of a few of these texts, that the complete harmony of the Word may be clearly seen.</p>

            <div class="notes-content">
                <p>1. Note the faith of the dying thief. In this dark hour he saw in the One who was hanging on the cross the Redeemer of men; he saw Him as a King. He looked by faith into the future, and saw the Saviour a victor over every foe and in possession of His glorious kingdom. The thief asked that at that time, and not on the day upon which he made the request, he might not be forgotten.</p><p>That he was not with Christ the day he was crucified is apparent for several reasons. (1) Jesus did not ascend to Paradise that day (John 20:19). (2) There is no probability that the thief died that day, for Pilate marveled that Jesus was so soon dead (Mark 15:43, 44), and the legs of the thieves were broken for the purpose evidently that they might not escape when taken from the cross, which would have been unnecessary if they had been already dead. An error in punctuation which appears in the text, placing the comma before, instead of after, the word "to-day," is responsible for any apparent contradiction of other scriptures. Properly punctuated, the text would read as follows: "Verily I say unto thee to-day, thou shalt be with Me in Paradise." The following excellent note, taken from Rotherham's translation of the New Testament, in favor of this punctuation, makes the matter clear: "It is left for the reader to determine whether the words 'this day' should be joined (a) with the former part of the sentence, or (b) with the latter. In favor of (a) may be urged: (1) The fact that semeron, 'this day,' does not always stand first in the clause to which it belongs (see Luke 2:11; 5:26; 22:34; Acts 20:26; 22:3; 24:21; 26:29); (2) that being essentially a demonstrative word, it will bear any reasonable stress which may be laid upon it, whether it be placed before or after the words which it qualifies; (3) that it is far from meaningless if regarded as belonging to the opening words of asservation, 'Thou dost ask to be remembered then; verily thou art assured now. As on this day of My weakness and shame, thou hast faith to ask, I this day have authority to answer;' (4) that the latter part of the verse is thus left free to refer to the very matter of the supplicant's request, 'Thou dost ask to be remembered when I come in My kingdom; thou shalt be remembered then, and with distinguished favor; thou shalt be in My kingdom; shalt be with Me in the very Paradise of My kingdom, in the garden of the Lord.'"</p><p>2. It is not stated that the fire will burn to all eternity, but simply that it is "unquenchable," a term used to signify only destructive fire. Being kindled by Jehovah, no power can extinguish it. It will burn until that upon which it preys has been consumed.</p><p>3. The expression, "worm dieth not," is a figure expressive of the most complete destruction. The word translated "hell" in the passage is from the Greek word gehenna, which is defined by Greenfield as follows: "Gehenna, the Valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem, once celebrated for the horrid worship of Moloch, and afterwards polluted with every species of filth, as well as the carcasses of animals and dead bodies of malefactors; to consume which, in order to avert the pestilence which such a mass of corruption would occasion, constant fires were kept burning."</p><p>That which the fire did not consume, the worm would seize upon and devour. The figure here used is borrowed from Isa. 51:6-8; 66:24. Dr. Boothroyd translates Isa. 51:6-8 as follows:—</p><p>"Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die like an insect; but My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be abolished. Fear ye not the reproach of men, and be not afraid of their revilings, for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool, but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to generation." The figure here used denotes complete destruction and extinction of being.</p><p>4. The wicked truly will receive everlasting punishment. It will continue as long as the reward of the righteous. But the punishment is death, not eternal torture. We frequently speak of "capital punishment," meaning death. Their punishment will be the second death, a death from which there is no resurrection.</p><p>5. Note that this fire "devours," literally "eats up," the wicked. The terms "for ever and ever" here employed in no way contradict this. That they are sometimes used to denote absolute eternity there is no doubt. There is as little doubt that they are as frequently used to denote limited duration. See Jonah 2:6; Ex. 21:1-6; 1 Chron. 28:4; 2 Kings 5:27.</p><p>6. The spirit, or breath, of all, both righteous and wicked, are here said to return to God. If this meant a conscious existence, it would place all, both righteous and wicked, around the throne of God, which would be universal salvation. The spirit returns to God in the same sense in which it came from Him, and is no more a conscious entity after returning than before being received by man.</p><p>7. Christ here appeared in His glory as King. Elijah, who was translated (2 Kings 2:11), appeared as a representative of those who will be translated into the kingdom at the coming of the Lord. Moses was resurrected (Jude 9), and appeared as a representative of all who will be raised from the dead at the appearing of Christ. The Saviour here gave in epitome, a representation of His future eternal kingdom. 2 Peter 1:16-18.</p>

                <p>1. Through a belief in the immortality of the soul, many have been led to believe that angels are the spirits of the dead. That this belief is erroneous is evident from the fact that angels existed before man, or even this world, was created.</p><p>2. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His people, and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel. If the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger, the angels that ever attend them would fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and the angels in the city would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission another angel to descend to encourage, watch over, and try to keep them from going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed to the watchful care of these angels, and would not be comforted by them, but continued to go astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They would bear the tidings upward, and all the angels in the city would weep, and then with a loud voice say, Amen. But if the saints fixed their eyes upon the prize before them, and glorified God by praising Him, then the angels in the city would touch their golden harps and sing with a loud voice, Alleluiah! and the heavenly arches would ring with their lovely songs."—Early Writings, pages 31, 32.</p><p>3. As heavenly angels attend us all through life, though unseen to us, they doubtless make a faithful record of all the acts of our lives, and in the judgment will be there ministering unto Him who sits as Judge. The very angel who made the record of your life will be there to bear witness to its truthfulness.</p>

                <p>1. Satan was one of the covering cherubs, created for this very position, and stood next to Christ in position and power. He was the leader of the heavenly choir ("Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 1, page 28). He allowed pride to enter into his heart, and, becoming jealous of Christ, and dissatisfied with the position given him by the Creator, he sought to exalt himself above God. It is impossible to explain or fully understand how sin entered into his heart; this is the mystery of sin. But the fact remains nevertheless. Having whispered his disaffection among the angelic host, he succeeded in leading almost one-third of the loyal angels into rebellion (Rev. 12:4), who with him were cast out of heaven ("Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 1, page 22). These angels, under the leadership of that master mind who led them into ruin, are all engaged in deceiving souls. As the end grows nearer, they become more active in their warfare, till all the world, except a remnant whose names are in the book of life, comes at last under their control.</p><p>2. Note that Satan began his work of rebellion against God in this earth by questioning what Jehovah has said, and creating doubt in the mind as to the faithfulness of His Word. His method had in no way changed. Every suggestion, no matter from what source it may come, which tends to in any way weaken faith in God's Word, is inspired by Satan, who well knows that his attacks are vain so long as we hold fast to the Scriptures of truth.</p>

            <div class="notes-content">
                <p>1. Spiritualism is defined as follows:—
"The belief that the spirits of the dead in various ways communicate with and manifest their presence to men, usually through the agency of a person called a medium."—Standard Dictionary.
"The very central truth of Spiritualism is the power and possibility of spirit return, under certain conditions, to communicate with those in the material form."—N. F. Ravlin, Spiritualist lecturer.</p><p>2. The Lord told Adam that the penalty for eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was death. Gen. 2:17. Satan contradicted this statement, and said, "Ye shall not surely die." Chap. 3:4. But as a consequence of man's transgression, death entered into the world (Rom. 5:12), and Satan's lie was unmasked. But Satan, to make appear true his falsehood uttered in Eden, instilled into the mind of man the idea of inherent immortality and consciousness in death. Through a belief in his statement, he has caused it to be taught that what seems to be death is not death, but merely transition; that the soul—the real thinking man—lives right on. Then, in the Spiritualistic seance, fallen angels, transformed into angels of light, appear, and claim to be the spirits of the dead from the world of light, and thus aid on the great deception.</p><p>3. When Moses and Aaron appeared before Pharaoh by direction of the Lord, and with a special message, a miracle-working agency was brought forward to resist their work. The sorcerers and magicians (the spiritual mediums of that time), two of whom were Jannes and Jambres, were called in, and by satanic agency wrought an apparent miracle. This same miracle-working agency will appear in the earth in the last days to hinder the message of God. Error ever seeks to entrench itself behind forms, and produces, as proof that it is right, some supernatural manifestation. Truth sets forth as the credentials of its divine origin the plain statements of the Bible, and is ever willing to trust alone in these.</p><p>4. Samuel was dead and buried at Ramah (1 Sam. 28:3), and, consequently, could not be present on this occasion. That no heavenly being was present is clear from the fact that, because of his rebellious course, the Lord had refused to answer Saul (verse 6), and with this dark seance of Satan he could have nothing to do. One of the fallen angels, transformed into an angel of light, appeared, personating the aged prophet. In modern seances the same scenes are again enacted.</p><p>5. "I saw the rapidity with which this delusion was spreading. A train of cars was shown me, going with the speed of lightning. The angel bade me look carefully. I fixed my eyes on the train. It seemed that the whole world was on board; that there could be none left. Said the angel, 'They are binding in bundles ready to burn.' Then he showed me the conductor, who looked like a stately, fair person, whom all the passengers looked up to and reverenced. I was perplexed, and asked my attending angel who it was. Said he, 'It is Satan. He is the conductor, in the form of an angel of light. He has taken the world captive. They are given over to strong delusions, to believe a lie, that they may be damned. This agent, the next highest in order to him, is the engineer; the other of his agents are employed in different offices as he may need them, and they are all going with lightning speed to perdition.'"—Early Writings, page 4 (supplement).</p>

                <p>1. Some conscientious souls are in distress at times, fearing that because of sin the Spirit of God has been grieved from them forever. But notice that the first work of the Holy Spirit when It comes to the heart is to bring conviction of sin. Those who feel a real sorrow and conviction for sin may rest assured that the tender Spirit of God is still striving with them.</p><p>2. "All who were fully identified as disciples of Christ and associated with the apostles as evangelists, assembled together at Jerusalem. They put away all differences. They continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, that they might receive the fulfilment of the promise of the Holy Spirit; for they were to preach the Gospel in the demonstration of the Spirit and in the power of God. . . . This is the very course that should be pursued by those who act a part in the work of proclaiming the coming of the Lord in the clouds of heaven; for a people are to be prepared to stand in the great day of God."—Gospel Workers, page 370.</p>

                <p>1. The gift of prophecy is important because it teaches God's will, and all the other gifts in their fulness are dependent upon its reception. Only as the Spirit of prophecy is confirmed in us may we hope to have all the gifts. 1 Cor. 1:4-8.</p><p>2. So long as the Spirit of God is in the earth, the gifts of the Spirit will be seen in a greater or less degree. In the closing days of earth's history, when the power of Satan will be manifested in no ordinary manner, it is reasonable, as well as scriptural, that the operations of the Holy Spirit will be witnessed in a special manner, and the gifts of the Spirit be revealed in the church. God placed these gifts in the church "for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering unto the building up of the body of Christ," and they will remain there until the church militant becomes the church triumphant. Note that among other gifts in the church is that of prophecy. As this is the greatest gift (1 Cor. 14:1, 39), we may expect that it will be the leading gift.</p>

                <p>1. Counterfeit money being in circulation in no way discounts the genuine currency; neither will the fact that false prophets are in the earth in any way affect the work of the true prophets. The fact that we are warned against false prophets is evidence that the manifestations of the genuine will be in the earth. If all were to be counterfeit, the Lord could have said, "Beware of prophets."</p><p>2. In vision the prophet of the Lord loses his own strength. His breath also is taken away. In this condition, under the direct control of the Holy Spirit, are made such revelations as the Lord is pleased to make. They speak as they are moved by the Holy Spirit. True prophets in vision always have their eyes open.</p><p>3. In the life and work of Mrs. E. G. White, whose labors have been identified with this message from its rise, we have the clearest evidence that there is manifested the gift of prophecy as truly as in servants of the Lord in the past. The gift stands every scriptural test, and, through all the perplexities which have attended our work, this gift has been present to direct and point out the right way. Read carefully the chapters written especially upon this subject in "Rise and Progress of Seventh-day Adventists," by Elder J. N. Loughborough.</p>

                <p>1. Many observe the first day of the week as the sabbath to commemorate the resurrection of Christ. There is no scriptural authority for this practice. The divinely-appointed memorial of the resurrection is baptism. Having become dead to sin, the repentant sinner is buried in the watery grave, and raised again to walk in newness of life, thus showing his faith in the One who says, "I am the resurrection and the life."</p><p>2. The eunuch doubtless knew nothing concerning baptism, except as Philip revealed it in preaching Christ unto him. From this it is clearly seen that to fully preach Christ is to preach baptism and immediately upon receiving Him into our hearts there will spring up a desire to be buried with Him in baptism.</p>

                <p>1. "There was a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. This contention, carried on in the presence of Christ, grieved and wounded Him. . . . The request of James and John to sit on the right and left of Christ's throne had excited the indignation of the others. That the two brothers should presume to ask for the highest position, so stirred the ten that alienation threatened. . . . When the disciples entered the supper room, their hearts were full of resentful feelings. Judas pressed next to Christ on the left side; John was on the right. If there was a higher place, Judas was determined to have it, and that place was thought to be next to Christ. And Judas was a traitor."—Desire of Ages, pages 643, 644.</p><p>2. "When the Saviour's hands were bathing those [Judas'] soiled feet, and wiping them with the towel, the heart of Judas thrilled through and through with the impulse then and there to confess his sin."—Id., page 645.</p><p>3. "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for the sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished, the heart can not enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the communion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed."—Id., page 650.</p><p>4. Note the solemn import of the words, "I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." The Saviour has not tasted the wine since that sad hour in the upper chamber. Neither will He, until at the marriage supper when He has His redeemed family all home. Then, seated at that table which is "miles in length," He will gird Himself and serve them, and drink with them the new wine of the kingdom. Jesus is looking forward to this time with joyful anticipation, and when He sees His ransomed ones all safe from the power of sin, then will He indeed "see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied." Isa. 53:11.</p><p>5. "Nothing corrupted by fermentation, the symbol of sin and death, could represent the Lamb without blemish and without spot!"—Desire of Ages, page 653.</p>

Loughborough, treats the subject of the Spirit of prophecy in the church in a very comprehensive and satisfactory manner.
