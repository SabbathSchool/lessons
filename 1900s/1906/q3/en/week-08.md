## Notes

1. Many are in perplexity as to whether they are in a saved condition, whether or not they have passed from death unto life. They need not be. Here is a test by which each can determine for himself his standing before the Lord. If we love the brethren, not some of them simply, but all of them, our name stands recorded in the book of life. But if hatred fills our heart against some one, we are not written among the living.

2. "If we do represent Christ, we shall make His service appear attractive, as it really is. Christians who gather up gloom and sadness to their souls, and murmur and complain, are giving to others a false representation of God and the Christian life. They give the impression that God is not pleased to have His children happy, and in this they bear false witness against our Heavenly Father."—Steps to Christ, page 147.
