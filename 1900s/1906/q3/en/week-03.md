## Notes

1. This is the "first commandment with promise" doubtless for the reason that it is the first precept which we are called upon to obey when born into the world. The first duty a child can render is obedience to its parents.

2. "Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due to no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a responsibility for the souls committed to their charge, has ordained that during the earlier years of life parents shall stand in the place of God to their children. And he who rejects the rightful authority of his parents, is rejecting the authority of God. The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield respect, submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and comfort them in old age. It also enjoins respect for ministers and rulers, and for all others to whom God has delegated authority."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 290.

3. "As the children sang in the temple courts, 'Hosanna! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,' so in these last days; children's voices will be raised to give the last message of warning to a perishing world. When heavenly intelligences see that men are no longer permitted to present the truth, the Spirit of God will come upon the children, and they will do a work in the proclamation of the truth which the older workers can not do, because their way will be hedged up."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, pages 202, 203.
