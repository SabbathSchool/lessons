## Notes

1. "Every injustice or grievance reacts and leaves a stain and a wound. All the cruelties and persecutions that human hate could inflict would not leave one trace of real harm upon us, but every feeling of resentment admitted into our hearts, every angry word uttered, will leave a stain. Forbearance thus becomes a perfect shield which protects us from all the cruelties and wrongs of life."—Week Day Religion, page 201.

2. "It is a majestic power, this power of keeping silent. Great is the conqueror who leads armies to victories. Mighty is the strength that captures a city. But he is greater who can rule his own spirit. There are men who can command armies but can not command themselves. There are men who by their burning words can sway vast multitudes who can not keep silence under provocation or wrong. The highest mark of nobility is self-control. It is more kingly than regal crown and purple robe."—Idem, pages 198, 199.

3. Impatience! This evil thing is manifest everywhere. How many irritable, fretful souls there are who manifest, through sharp, impatient words, the raging, uncontrolled passions within. In many professed Christian homes hearts are many times caused to ache because of unkind words, spoken because of anger aroused through some trifling thing. "My brethren, these things ought not so to be." With the Lord there is help for every soul who is "easily provoked."
