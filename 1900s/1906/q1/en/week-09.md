## Note

"We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the fruit of faith." "That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from the obligation of obedience to God is not faith, but presumption."â€”Steps to Christ, pages 73, 74.
