## Notes

1. In order to have any correct idea of God, we must accept all that is revealed concerning Him in the Scriptures. The Bible teaches the omnipresence of God, but it just as plainly teaches that there is a dwelling-place where His personal Presence is found, in a sense in which it is not found in any other place. We may not be able to explain these two facts concerning the presence of God, but by believing them both we shall be saved from pantheistic teaching on the one hand, and from too circumscribed conceptions of God on the other hand. God is a personal being, with a dwelling-place, but He is everywhere present by His Spirit.

2. "In the creation of man was manifest the agency of a personal God. When God had made man in His image, the human form was perfect in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then a personal, self-existing God breathed into that form the breath of life, and man became a living, breathing, intelligent being."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. VIII, page 264.

3. Rotherham's translation of Heb. 1:3 reads thus: "Being an eradiated brightness of His glory, and an exact representation of His very being," etc. Christ is declared to be "the image of God" (2 Cor. 4:4), as man was created "in the image of God," and this image was never marred by sin in the experience of Christ.

4. "The mighty power that works through all nature and sustains all things is not, as some men of science represent, merely an all-pervading principle, an actuating energy. God is a spirit; yet He is a personal being, for man was made in His image."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. VIII, page 263.

The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
