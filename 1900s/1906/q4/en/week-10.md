## Notes

1. The power of the Creator to foretell future events implies foreknowledge, and the power also to fashion all things according to the council of His own will. As we may stand where our view is unobstructed, and be eye-witnesses of scenes which transpire before us; so God can look down through the stream of time, and with unclouded vision see the end, and all the intervening events, from the beginning.

2. In the prophecy of the 2,300 days of Dan. 8:14, the exact date of the crucifixion of our Lord was foretold. This period began with the "going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem." This decree went forth 457 B.C. See Ezra 7. At the end of sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years, the "anointed One, the Prince" was to appear. Christ was anointed at His baptism with the Holy Spirit, A.D. 27, and began His work as "the Messiah." After His baptism He came into Galilee "preaching the gospel of God and saying, The time is fulfilled." No doubt He referred to prophetic time. In the midst, or middle, of the week, or three and one-half years later—A.D. 31—He was to be cut off, or be crucified, thus causing the "sacrifice and the oblation to cease." It would be well in this connection to make a careful study of the 2,300 days. See "Thoughts," or "The Sanctuary and Its Cleansing."

3. "It [Tyre] is a Babel of broken walls, pillars, vaults, etc., there being not so much as one entire house left! Its present inhabitants are only a few poor wretches, harboring themselves in the vaults, and subsisting chiefly on fishing; who seem to be preserved in this place by divine Providence as a visible argument how God has fulfilled His word concerning Tyre, that it should be the top of a rock, a place for fishers to dry their nets on."—Mandrell.
