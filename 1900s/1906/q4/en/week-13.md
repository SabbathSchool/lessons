## Notes

1. If it is our duty and privilege "in whatsoever we do in word or deed to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus," then we should be careful to see that our every word and action adorn that worthy name whereby we are called.

2. The greatest "stumbling-block" in the way of unbelievers is the inconsistent course of professed believers. By ungodly lives, they often give occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, and to scoff at the reality of the religion of Jesus Christ. By such that blessed name is trampled in the mire.

3. The world at large will not come to the Word of God to receive light, and to learn the way of salvation. While it is true that the works of God in nature are a constant witness to all, yet the Lord's true disciples will give infallible proof in their lives of the reality of the religion of Jesus Christ. "Now that Jesus has ascended to heaven, His disciples are His representatives among men, and one of the most effective ways of winning souls to Him is in exemplifying His character in our daily lives. Our influence upon others depends not so much upon what we say as upon what we are. Men may combat and defy our logic; they may resist our appeals; but a life of disinterested love is an argument they can not gainsay. A consistent life, characterized by the meekness of Christ, is a power in the world."â€”Desire of Ages, pages 141, 142.
