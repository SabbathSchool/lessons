## A FRESH NEW STOCK

"I want a light, thin Bible with the largest type made."

How often has every Bible salesman heard this request. The day of the Bible with voluminous Helps is past, and the day of the very thin Bible is here.

And this is only one of the numerous points we have learned about the kinds of Bibles our customers want. They also want the most durable leathers, the most satisfactory papers, the handiest Bibles for the pocket, the most helpful styles for the student, the most attractive and serviceable for the children.

In laying in our new stock—all our old books were burned—these points have all been carefully considered as a glance over the following list will prove.

If the information is not sufficient, please write for a more complete description and it will be gladly given.
