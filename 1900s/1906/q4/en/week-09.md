## Notes

1. It is not death, or the condition of being "unclothed" that the redeemed long for, but possessing mortal flesh and being subject to death, there is a natural longing to be "clothed upon," or to possess immortality.

2. There is probably not a single member of the human family who would endure the struggle against the world, the flesh, and the devil were it not for that hope which is "an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast," which constitutes the helmet of salvation. The glorious prospects of "the world to come" thus constitute an important resource in the plan of salvation.

3. Joy is usually of a very transient nature here, but in the "world to come" the ransomed of the Lord will possess "everlasting joy."
