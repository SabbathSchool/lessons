## Notes

1. While this scripture applies especially to ministers of the Gospel, it does not exclude others also. The Lord has given to all a part in the work of reconciliation.

2. He who preaches should not only believe what he teaches, but should conscientiously practice the same. The most effectual way of preaching is by practicing. Rom. 2:21-23.

"The teaching of Christ was the expression of an inwrought conviction and experience, and those who learn of Him become teachers after the same divine order. The Word of God, spoken by one who is himself sanctified through it, has a life-giving power that makes it attractive to the hearers, and convicts them that it is a living reality."â€”Desire of Ages, page 142.
