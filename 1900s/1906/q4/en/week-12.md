## Note

It is said of Jesus, that "for the joy that was set before Him," He "endured the cross, despising the shame." That joy is in seeing the blood-bought throng before the throne, "filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory," and of knowing that all this bliss could not have been experienced had it not been for His sacrifice. Isa. 53:11. The faithful minister will share in the joy of his Lord, when he himself stands before the throne and sees around him the vouchers of his ministry, the flock his care has nourished, fed, and saved.
