## Notes

"The connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministration of angels of God, and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly revealed in the Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven with human history." "Evil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in nature, power, and glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers. But fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dishonor of God and the destruction of men." These evil spirits work "in the children of disobedience" (Eph. 2:2), who yield themselves as servants (Rom. 6:16), in marvelous ways (Matt. 24:24), and more and more as time advances (2 Tim. 3:13), until fire is brought down from heaven (Rev. 13:13), "and as the crowning act in the great drama of deception Satan himself will personate Christ." "The people of God are directed to the Scriptures as the safeguard against the influence of false teachers and the delusive power of spirits of darkness" (Isa. 8:20). "Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except by the holy Scriptures." Error is not to be countenanced, although preached by an angel (Gal. 1:8); neither, because we despise the messenger (Mark 6:3), are we to reject truth (John 10:37, 38). Christ was born of the Spirit (Luke 1:35), and dwelt in the flesh (John 1:14), and so He must dwell in our flesh (Eph. 3:17), living in us (Gal. 2:20), to give us victory (2 Cor. 2:14) in the conflict with unseen powers (Eph. 6:12). Any one who presents any other hope of salvation is a deceiver and an antichrist (2 John 7). "Jesus fought all our battles during His life upon earth" (John 16:33), and "we each have a battle to fight with a fallen foe." "The hand of the Infinite is stretched over the battlements of heaven to grasp your hand in its embrace. The mighty Helper is nigh to help the most erring, the most sinful and despairing." God and the world, the followers of Christ and the servants of Satan, "the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error," are in marked contrast. All are found in one of two classes (Matt. 12:30), and the same person can not be found in both (Matt. 6:24).

The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
