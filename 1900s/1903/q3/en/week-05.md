# Lesson 5 - The Mystery of God

August 1, 1903

## Ephesians 3:1-13

(1) For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,â€”(2) if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward; (3) how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words, (4) whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ: (5) which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; (6) to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, (7) whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of His power. (8) Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; (9) and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things; (10) to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God, (11) according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; (12) in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in Him. (13) Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.

## Notes

1. "For this cause" includes what he has revealed of Christ's work for them. Following the first verse is a parenthetical expression which extends to verse thirteen inclusive, when the subject introduced in the first verse is resumed.

2. "Dispensation" means "stewardship." Paul's stewardship which he was to dispense was the gospel of the grace of God.

3. By "revelation" was the gospel made known to Paul. By revelation it comes to us. We may study the sublimest themes in a perfunctory surface way, and know little more than at the beginning. But when we are yielded to God wholly, His Spirit will in times of need reveal to us the great truths of God.
