# Lesson 9 - The Godly Life

August 29, 1903

## Ephesians 4:25-32; 5:1, 2

(25) Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another. (26) Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: (27) neither give place to the devil. (28) Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need. (29) Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear. (30) And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption. (31) Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice: (32) and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.

(1) Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children: (2) and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.

## Notes

1. Note the "wherefore." It is based on the scripture of the last lesson. If the "old man" has been put off, if the "new man" has been put on, then there should follow these fruits of godliness: truth, gentleness, honesty, purity, faithfulness, should be manifest.

2. He who holds anger in his heart against persons gives all the place to the devil that anger occupies. "Anger resteth in the bosom of fools." He who harbors it, harbors an enemy to his own soul, and this is true of any other sin. One sin cherished, or given place in the heart, will open the door to the devil.

3. "Grieve not." God's Spirit will not always strive with man. Gen. 6:3. But when the Spirit leaves us it will be because we have refused to receive it, and we refuse to receive it when we refuse its warnings against sin, its admonitions to do right. As long as there is sin in the heart, the Spirit is grieved.

4. "Bitterness" ("picra," the name of a bitter drug), a bitter frame of mind; "wrath," irritation, exasperation, not so enduring as anger; "anger," violent outbreak; "clamor," outward manifestation of wrath or anger in brawling; "railing," blasphemy, reviling, calumny, evil speaking in general; "malice," a malevolent disposition towards one's neighbor, giving rise to all the other evils named above.
