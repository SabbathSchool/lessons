# Lesson 12 - Home Instruction

September 19, 1903

## Ephesians 5:29-33; 6:1-9

(29) For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; (30) because we are members of His body. (31) For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh. (32) This mystery is great; but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church. (33) Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.

(1) Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. (2) Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise), (3) that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. (4) And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.

(5) Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; (6) not in the way of eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; (7) with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men: (8) knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether he be bond or free. (9) And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.

## Note

Both husband and wife will obtain the greatest benefit from this and the previous lesson by each one seeking to know his or her duty. Let the husband seek to know not what God asks of the wife, but what God requires of him, and then let him do it. Let the wife seek to know not what God requires of the husband, but what He requires of her, and then let her do it. The same principle applies to parent and child, to servant and master. Let each one seek to know and do his own duty.
