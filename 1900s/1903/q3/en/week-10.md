# Lesson 10 - Children of Light

September 5, 1903

## Ephesians 5:3-14

(3) But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; (4) nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting; but rather giving of thanks. (5) For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolator, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. (6) Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. (7) Be not ye therefore partakers with them; (8) for ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light (9) (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), (10) proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; (11) and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; (12) for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. (13) But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. (14) Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.

## Notes

1. How easy it is to spread the news of scandal! God says, "Let it not once be named among you." It does no good, and every repetition more deeply engraves its image on your mind. Next to the above sin, what a temptation it is to tell questionable anecdotes or indulge in lewd jokes. Doddridge renders for jesting, "lewd turns," a common thing. All these things are not befitting, not becoming. Let the speech be pure; control the tongue by letting Christ live in the heart.

2. Notice that verse 9 is parenthetical, thrown in, to show that genuine light will bear fruit. Verse 10 connects with verse 8: "Walk as children of light, . . . proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;" not proving it to Him, but in ourselves and to others. Compare with Rom. 12:1, 2, proving the acceptable "will of God." "If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know." John 7:17.

3. If it is a shame to speak of the evil things done by the wicked in secret, is it not a shame to visit them? It is quite fashionable in some religious circles to "go slumming." Of ourselves and to others. Compare with Rom. 12:1, 2, proving "Who is blind, but My Servant? or deaf, as My Messenger that I send? who is blind as He that is at peace with Me, and blind as Jehovah's Servant? Thou seest many things, but Thou observest not; His ears are open, but He heareth not." Isa. 52:13; 42:19, 20. Seeing the evil does us no good, at the best, and it may do untold harm.
