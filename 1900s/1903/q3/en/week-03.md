# Lesson 3 - Living in Christ

July 18, 1903

## Ephesians 2:1-10

(1) And you did He make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins, (2) wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; (3) among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:—(4) but God, being rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, (5) even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved), (6) and raised us up with Him, and made us to sit with Him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus: (7) that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus: (8) for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; (9) not of works, that no man should glory. (10) For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.

## Note

Through God's favor alone are we saved. Naught that we can do or suffer, naught that we are or can be, entitles us to the salvation of God. He has purchased the salvation, and it awaits every soul who will believe. Faith—acceptance, yielding to do, or be, or have, choosing God's way—is the channel of the salvation; but we are saved by grace. Of course, God gives all good things, and so from Him come the grace and the power to believe; but these are not the gift of this text; grammatical construction forbids such application. The salvation, the saving, is the gift of God.
