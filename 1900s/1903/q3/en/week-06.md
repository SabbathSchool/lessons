# Lesson 6 - Glorious Privileges in God

August 8, 1903

## Ephesians 3:1, 14-21

(1) For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles.

(14) For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, (15) from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, (16) that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inward man; (17) that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, (18) may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, (19) and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.

(20) Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, (21) unto Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations forever and ever. Amen.

## Notes

1. God is the Father of every family, or "fatherhood." The word means more than a household. It means the fatherhood of a world, of every world. All are named after the great eternal Father, so that every one in the universe are brothers, members of the same family in our God.

2. "Be strong . . . power . . . might."â€”Vincent well remarks that it is "an interesting study" to note the apostle's use of words for power, might, strength, etc., in this epistle. He uses every Greek word used in the New Testament save one. Eight different terms are used, among them "dunamis," from which comes our "dynamite," the explosive; but not so named from similarity of working, but from the force or power exercised; "energeia," from which comes our "energy." The one Word not used is "bia," meaning "violence." God's Spirit does not operate or work that way, and yet His power is stronger than all violence.
