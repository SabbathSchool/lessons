# Lesson 8 - The Gifts and Their Purpose

August 22, 1903

## Ephesians 4:11-24

(11) And He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; (12) for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ: (13) till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; (14) that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; (15) but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him, who is the head, even Christ; (16) from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.

(17) This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, (18) being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart; (19) who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. (20) But ye did not so learn Christ; (21) if so be that ye heard Him, and were taught in Him, even as truth is in Jesus; (22) that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit; (23) and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind, (24) and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.

## Notes

1. "He gave some." Not all of the gifts of the Spirit are mentioned in any one passage of Scripture. It is only by studying all the Scriptures relating to them that we obtain an understanding of their exceeding fulness. The gifts here mentioned,—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers,—are especially necessary in building up the church, and are also representative of other gifts. (See 1 Corinthians 12; Rom. 12:3-5; Matt. 25:14, 15; Luke 19:12, 13.) The talents and pounds are identical with the gifts. They are given by the same one to the same persons, for the same time, and for the same purpose.

2. "Till we all attain." This scripture, together with the parables of the talents and pounds, show conclusively that God designed that spiritual gifts should continue in His church till His coming. Then His church will be complete, "not having spot or wrinkle" (Eph. 5:27), lacking in "no gift" (1 Cor. 1:7). Then prophecy will fail, for the "perfect" will then have come. 1 Cor. 13:9, 10.

3. "Alienated from the life of God" means to be estranged away, to be non-participant in; compare chapter 2:12, "separate from Christ," "without God." Such have the life common to all animal creation, but the life of God, given by His Spirit, nourished by His Word, enabling the receiver to overcome, the unbelieving do not know or possess. The ignorance which destroys comes from the hardening of the heart in sin.
