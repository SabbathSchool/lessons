## DO YOU HAVE THE LESSON HELP

A SERIES of very helpful studies on the wonderful Epistle to the Ephesians has been prepared by the writer of the lessons contained in this pamphlet. These studies will be printed from week to week in the Signs of the Times, and will be so combined with the lessons themselves, which will also appear, as not only to make them of special help to teachers and students, but exceedingly interesting to the general reader.

An opportunity is thereby afforded to make the Signs serve at least two purposes,—as an important help in the preparation of the Sabbath-school lessons, and as a powerful agent in missionary work.

## Introductory Notes

1. With the exception of the first lesson, this entire study is on the epistle of Paul to the Ephesians and to us.

2. Three months is too short a time to devote to this wonderful book, unless it is studied diligently, prayerfully. Therefore so study its wonderful message.

3. Seek to know what the book says and means, not what the lesson writer may mean. His earnest desire is to open the book to all. Therefore study the book.

4. Read it through carefully at one sitting. Do this frequently. Get familiar with its parts and proportions. It is one epistle, not six.

5. Read the lesson one or more times every day. Try the asking of your own questions. Many more may be asked than those printed.

6. In questioning the class, do not ask all the questions in a paragraph at once. Each question stands by itself.

7. Above all things, make the instruction personal, receive its message, appropriate its blessings, and use them to God's glory. "It is better to give than to receive," comes to us through Ephesus. Acts 20:17, 18, 35.

The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
