# Lesson 4 - The Household of God

July 25, 1903

## Ephesians 2:11-22

(11) Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; (12) that ye were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. (13) But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ. (14) For He is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition, (15) having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that He might create in Himself of the two one new man, so making peace; (16) and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: (17) and He came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh: (18) for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father. (19) So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, (20) being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the chief corner stone; (21) in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; (22) in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.

## Notes

1. The word Gentile comes from a Greek word (ethnos) meaning "race," "nation." The meaning in the Old Testament is the same. The Revised Version almost invariably renders it "nation." It is the same word in the Septuagint as in the New Testament Greek. It generally refers to the nations outside of Israel, nations invariably pagan, without hope and without God. It also refers, as in this entire passage, to those who know not Christ; for such, not belonging to God's "holy nation," are classed with the nations without. In the fullest, deepest meaning, Gentile and Israel denote spiritual conditions. To be a Gentile, ignore or reject Christ; to be an Israelite, accept Him. The uncircumcision and the circumcision were terms used by the Jews to denote the two classes; but to them it was a mere outward matter. To the instructed child of faith, circumcision was a seal of the righteousness of God. See Rom. 2:28; 29; 4:11; Phil. 3:3. It was not itself a saving ordinance; it was a sign of a saved condition.

2. In the study of the "enmity" do not omit Rom. 8:7. There we are clearly told what it is. "The mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh can not please God." See also verse 16 of lesson. On ordinances study Col. 2:14, 15, 20-23. The enmity is that which separated both Jew and Gentile from God; and the only thing which separates from God is sin. Sin takes away all peace of mind. Sinning is warring with God. Jesus Christ is not alone our peacemaker, but He is our "peace," even as He was our "sin." 2 Cor. 5:21. He abolished sin by becoming sin and dying to sin. Rom. 6:10. He became sin for us. By faith we accept the offering for our sin, accept the abolition in His flesh for our flesh, His crucifixion as ours, His life of righteousness as ours, and so He is our peace. "Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Jesus Christ." Rom. 6:11. "Crucified with Him," dead with Him, "united with Him in the likeness of His death," in order that we may be "justified from sin;" that we "no longer be in bondage to sin;" that we may "live with Him;" that we may be "united with Him" "in the likeness of His resurrection." Rom. 6:1-10. And the one new man is Christ the head, and His people the body.

3. Not the corner stone laid by apostles and prophets, but the corner stone on which both prophets and apostles builded. That corner stone is Christ Jesus. 1 Peter 2:6-8.
