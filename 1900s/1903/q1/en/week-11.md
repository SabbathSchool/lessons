# Lesson 11 â€” Deliverance from Sin

MARCH 14, 1903

## PSALM 107:1-16

O give thanks unto Jehovah; for He is good;
For His loving-kindness endureth forever.
Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,
Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
And gathered out of the lands,
From the east and from the west,
From the north and from the south.
They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
They found no city of habitation.
Hungry and thirsty,
Their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He delivered them out of their distresses,
He led them also by a straight way,
That they might go to a city of habitation.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
For He satisfieth the longing soul,
And the hungry soul He filleth with good.
Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
Being bound in affliction and iron,
Because they rebelled against the words of God,
And contemned the counsel of the Most High;
Therefore He brought down their heart with labor;
They fell down, and there was none to help.
Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He saved them out of their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
And brake their bonds in sunder.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
For He hath broken the gates of brass,
And cut the bars of iron in sunder.

## Notes

We are not merely to think it, but to say it, that the Lord is good. The more the redeemed of the Lord say it, the deeper sense of His goodness will they have. It is wonderful how much help one may receive by the earnest effort to tell others how good the Lord is. Let us open our mouths and say it out. Heb. 13:15.

God led the people forth "by the right way." The ways of the Lord are right. In Christ, the Way, we have deliverance from sin, from the power of the enemy. See the song of Zacharias. Luke 1:68-75. The record of the deliverances of a whole people is but the history of the work of God in our own hearts, the defeats, the victories, and the leadings in individual experiences.

Rebellion (verse 11) is the cause of our troubles. Jesus, our example, received teaching and discipline, and was not rebellious. Isa. 50:4-10.

When they fell down and there was none to help, then came deliverance, as they called on God. What assurance of victory in verses 12-14 of this psalm! Not a soul should pass this lesson, surely, without accepting deliverance; for every bond is loosed and every bar cut asunder.
