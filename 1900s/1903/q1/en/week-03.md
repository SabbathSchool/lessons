# Lesson 3 â€” God's Care for His Creatures

JANUARY 17, 1903

## PSALM 104:25-35

Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
Wherein are things creeping [moving] innumerable,
Both small and great beasts [living creatures].
There go the ships;
There is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to play therein.
These wait all for Thee,
That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.
Thou givest unto them, they gather;
Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled;
Thou takest away their breath, they die,
And return to their dust.
Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created;
And Thou renewest the face of the ground.
Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever;
Let Jehovah rejoice in His works;
Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live;
I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
Let my meditation be sweet unto Him;
I will rejoice in Jehovah.
Let sinners be consumed out of the earth,
And let the wicked be no more.
Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
Praise ye Jehovah.

## Notes

Still the psalmist sings of the eternal mercies of God and His wonderful providence. Now he shows that divine care is over even the innumerable forms of life beneath the broad expanse of the ocean. All wait upon God, and not one is forgotten. Luke 12:6, 7, 24. But that which is given, "they gather." Busy activity is the law of life for all creatures.

"The Lord shall rejoice in His works." See Ps. 147:11; Zeph. 3:16, 17. The earth itself is represented as responding to a look from the Creator. This sensitiveness of all creation to the touch of God leads the psalmist to declare his purpose to meditate on God's care and glory continually. The advent idea pervades the psalms. Here is the divinely-inspired prayer for the blotting out of sin, which mars creation. It is the same prayer that closes the book of Revelation. Rev. 22:20.
