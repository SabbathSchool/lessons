# Lesson 8 â€” Experiences of Israel for Our Learning

FEBRUARY 21, 1903

## PSALM 106:6-20

We have sinned with our fathers,
We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Our fathers understood not Thy wonders in Egypt;
They remembered not the multitude of Thy loving-kindnesses,
But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,
That He might make His mighty power to be known.
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;
So He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
And the waters covered their adversaries;
There was not one of them left.
Then believed they His words;
They sang His praise.
They soon forgat His works;
They waited not for His counsel,
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
And tempted God in the desert.
And He gave them their request,
But sent leanness into their soul.
They envied Moses also in the camp,
And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
And covered the company of Abiram.
And a fire was kindled in their company;
The flame burned up the wicked.
They made a calf in Horeb,
And worshiped a molten image.
Thus they changed their glory
For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.

## Notes

This psalm opens with an exhortation to praise and thanksgiving and the acknowledgment that God's people to-day are repeating the history of His chosen people in the wilderness.

Verse 7. Observe how extensively this experience is being repeated in the lives of the majority of professed Christians. How rarely the multitude of God's mercies are recounted! This is the source of strength, the means by which Satan will always be defeated.

Verse 8. God is now gathering out a people for His name. Acts 15:14. We may not only be among that people, but we may share in gathering them, with this closing message, from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Through this people God will make known His mighty power; for He will vindicate His righteous character before the universe. This is the highest reason that can be assigned for God's great love in pardoning and saving sinners. Compare Eze. 36:22, 32; Isa. 43:25; 48:9; Jer. 14:7; Ps. 6:4; 23:3; 25:11; 31:16.

The song of Moses (Ex. 15:1-16) does not belong to the Jewish people alone. It points forward to the final victory, when the Israel of God will sing not only the song of Moses, but the song of the Lamb (Rev. 15:2, 3). Those who will sing that song of triumph then must learn to sing it now.

Ps. 50:23; 67:5; 146:2.

"The history of the wilderness life of Israel was chronicled for the benefit of the Israel of God to the close of time. The varied experience of the Hebrews was a school of preparation for their promised home in Canaan. God would have His people in these days review with a humble heart and teachable spirit the trials through which ancient Israel passed, that they may be instructed in their preparation for the heavenly Canaan."
