# Lesson 2 â€” The Great Provider

JANUARY 10, 1903

## PSALM 104:13-24

He watereth the mountains from His chambers;
The earth is filled with the fruit of Thy works.
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
And herb for the service of man;
That He may bring forth food out of the earth,
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
And oil to make his face to shine,
And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.
The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture,
The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;
Where the birds make their nests;
As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
The high mountains are for the wild goats;
The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
He appointed the moon for seasons;
The sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
The young lions roar after their prey,
And seek their food from God.
The sun ariseth, they get them away,
And lay them down in their dens.
Man goeth forth unto his work
And to his labor until the evening.
O Jehovah, how manifold are Thy works!
In wisdom hast Thou made them all;
The earth is full of Thy riches.

## Notes

Although the ground was cursed on account of the sin of man (Gen. 3:17), yet the power of God is working through it to supply His creatures with food. This is a revelation of the power of the cross of Christ in overcoming the curse.

From verses 14, 15, we may learn that food, both for man and beast, is the gift of God. Read John 6:5-12, 27, 32-35, and note the explanation thus given of the annual miracle of multiplying the loaves to feed the world.

Before sin came into the world and brought so many artificial conditions, man was in much closer touch with his Maker. "The sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed with a covering of light and glory such as the angels wear. So long as they lived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued to enshroud them." "It was the work of Adam and Eve to train the branches of the vine to form bowers, thus making for themselves a dwelling from living trees covered with foliage and fruit." Although the animal creation has been involved in the suffering consequent upon sin, yet the trees still constitute a home for the birds, the mountains for the goats, and the rocks for the conies.

When the young lions roar after their prey, God regards it as a call upon Him for food. Work was not imposed upon man as a punishment for sin. The Father and the Son are both workers. John 5:17. The experience of weariness and of wearing out while working is, however, one of the results of sin.

With verse 24 compare Prov. 3:19, 20 and Jer. 10:12. There is creative power in divine wisdom and true knowledge. "The true higher education is what makes students acquainted with God and His Word, and fits them for eternal life."
