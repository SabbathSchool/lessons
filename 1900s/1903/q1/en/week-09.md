# Lesson 9 — Experiences in the Wilderness

FEBRUARY 28, 1903

## PSALM 106:21-33

They forgat God their Saviour,
Who had done great things in Egypt,
Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
And terrible things by the Red Sea.
Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
Had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach,
To turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them.
Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
They believed not His word,
But murmured in their tents,
And harkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
Therefore He sware unto them,
That He would overthrow them in the wilderness,
And that He would overthrow their seed among the nations,
And scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,
And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Thus they provoked Him to anger with their doings;
And the plague brake in upon them.
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;
And so the plague was stayed.
And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,
Unto all generations forevermore.
They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah,
So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
Because they were rebellious against His Spirit,
And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

## Notes

Unsanctified memory is a treacherous thing. Notice how continually the people forgot God and His deliverances, and remembered the trials and difficulties. They remembered the leeks and onions of Egypt, but forgot the bitterness of their bondage. Let us count the mercies, and forget not the Lord's benefits.

When Moses plead with God for the people, he based his plea for pardon upon the covenant with Abraham (Ex. 32:11-13), the promise of forgiveness and righteousness by faith in Christ.

Many of the people, as they journeyed, lost sight of the aim of the movement, and did not believe the promise of an inheritance, hence the murmuring by the way. Now, with the inheritance just before us, let no one murmur in his tent. There is where it usually begins,—in the home.

At Baal-peor they ate the sacrifices that had been offered to the dead, joined in the heathen rites of ancient Spiritualism. As ancient Israel had to contend with this delusion, so in these last days the deceptive doctrines of spiritualism, theosophy, and such like, are spreading abroad to ensnare souls. But the very increase of Satan's deceptions is evidence that the time is short.
