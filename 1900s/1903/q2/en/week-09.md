May 30, 1903

## 1 Thess. 5:12-28

"(12) But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; (13) and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. (14) And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all. (15) See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all. (16) Rejoice always; (17) pray without ceasing; (18) in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward. (19) Quench not the Spirit; (20) despise not prophesyings; (21) prove all things; hold fast that which is good; (22) abstain from every form of evil.

(23) And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (24) Faithful is He that calleth you, who will also do it.

(25) Brethren, pray for us.

(26) Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. (27) I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.

(28) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."

## Notes

1. "At peace." There are turbulent spirits in this world of sin who can be at peace with no one, and above all with Christians. Yet as much as possible consistent with truth and righteousness, the child of God should live at peace with these. Rom. 12:18. But there is absolutely no reason why the children of the God of all peace should not be at peace among themselves, at peace with even the admonisher and reprover.

2. "Despise not prophesyings;" that is, do not consider them as of no account. There will be in the last days prophesyings many, false and true. Both are of vast account, the one in leading to death and destruction, the other to light and duty and life. "Prove all things," not by studying the false, but by knowing the true,—God's Word. Measure all voices by having God's voice written in your heart, your life attuned to its principles.

"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our watchword.
