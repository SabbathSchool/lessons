# Lesson 6 — Walking with God

May 9, 1903

## 1 Thess. 4:1-12

"(1) Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk,—that ye abound more and more. (2) For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus. (3) For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication; (4) that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor, (5) not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God; (6) that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified. (7) For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification. (8) Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth His Holy Spirit unto you.

(9) But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another; (10) for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more; (11) and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you; (12) that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing."

## Notes

1. All man-made religions, all perversions of the true religion, fostered or in some way excused the sins reproved in this lesson, making it easier for the natural heart to indulge them. The religion of Jesus Christ, the gospel of God, takes all these things from the heart and life if it is truly received. In these days the wickednesses of Sodom are being repeated on a much larger scale. The words of the Christian man should be pure and clean words.

2. We must never be content with present effort. The fruits of our work may have reached to the confines of our country; an apostle may have commended our work of faith, our labor of love, our patience of hope; our praise may be in all the churches; but all the past will prove a curse if it be not made a foundation for broader, better work. The rule always, if we would not die, is to "abound more and more."

We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field.
