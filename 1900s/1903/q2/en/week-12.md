# Lesson 12 â€” Chosen of God

June 20, 1903

## 2 Thess. 2:13-17; 3:1-5

"(13) But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: (14) whereunto He called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. (15) So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.

(16) Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, (17) comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.

(1) Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it is with you; (2) and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith. (3) But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil one. (4) And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command. (5) And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ."

## Notes

1. "Stand fast and hold." Stand fast for service; hold faithful to the orders. The word "tradition" does not mean a body of laws or instructions handed down from generation to generation, with no other authority behind it than age and what men have said. The word is used in its literal meaning, "delivery, handing over; what is transmitted, intrusted to." By word or epistle, Paul committed or intrusted to the Thessalonians the word of the gospel. It was their duty to hold it to the end.

2. There is no difference in the disposition, attitude, and feeling toward us of the Father and the Son. Both love us. Both give us eternal comfort and good hope. Both do it through grace, unmerited favor. Both will comfort and establish in every good word or work. But in Their love to us They must permit the unrest and instability when our work is of self and evil.

3. "Pray" not simply for ourselves, but for the servants of God; "pray" that God's Word may go freely, swiftly, mightily, and be glorified by fruit; "pray" that other souls may be searched out and saved, even as it searched you out. Thus does God speak to all His children. Thus will His Spirit lead us to do.

We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field.
