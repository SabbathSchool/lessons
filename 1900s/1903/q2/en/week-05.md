# Lesson 5 — Comforted in Their Faithfulness

May 2, 1903

## 1 Thess. 3:1-13

"(1) Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone; (2) and sent Timothy, our brother and God's minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith; (3) that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed. (4) For, verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer afflictions; even as it came to pass, and ye know. (5) For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain. (6) But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you; (7) for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith; (8) for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. (9) For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; (10) night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

(11) Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you: (12) and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you; (13) to the end He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints."

## Notes

1. "All that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." It may seem otherwise, but there is no exception. There may be no outward persecution to many. Life may flow on smoothly. Friends and neighbors may be kind, and perhaps of the same faith. Oh, how many content themselves in such circumstances to drift on, doing really nothing which demands sacrifice! They pay tithe; yes, but that is less than they have paid to maintain evil habits in sin. They know no burden of soul, no sacrifice of time or money. To live godly is to do as Jesus Christ did,—labor for others, give life for others. And he who does this, though he may meet with no human persecution, will meet the power of the adversary. But better the persecution and affliction with Jesus than a life of ease without Him.

2. Every humble man of God wants human company in his labors. It is God's plan to send men out at least "two and two." Greater strength and confidence are gathered in prayer and counsel. One shall chase a thousand; but two shall put ten thousand to flight. Yet Paul was willing to labor alone in the great, strange city for awhile, so that the new converts might not be left too long. When he had left them, he was forced to flee from them. Now he did not wish them to become discouraged by his afflictions or their own.

3. David said in the Spirit, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits to me?" Paul counted the conversion of these souls and their steadfastness in God as benefits which God had granted him.

4. "Abound in love one toward another." Oh, how much need there is of it! We can not abound toward others if not our brethren. Love grows by cultivation, by doing, by giving. He who shuts himself from ministry to his brethren can not love them.

5. "At the coming of our Lord Jesus." Literally at His personal presence, for so the word means. See 2 Cor. 7:6, 7; 10:10. He is here now by His ambassadors, and by His Spirit; but not in the sense of His promise. John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11. That promise will not be fulfilled until He comes in His own personal presence. Then we shall see Him as He is, this "same Jesus." That is the hope of the church.

The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
