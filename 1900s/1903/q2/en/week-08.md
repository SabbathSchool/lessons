# Lesson 8 â€” The Children of Light

May 23, 1903

## 1 Thess. 5:1-11

"(1) But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you. (2) For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. (3) When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in nowise escape. (4) But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief: (5) for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness; (6) so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober. (7) For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night. (8) But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.

(9) For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, (10) who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. (11) Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do."

## Notes

1. The day of the Lord does not open with Christ's coming. It begins with the pouring out of the plagues and the awfully solemn declaration of God that mankind by the acceptance or rejection of the gospel of God's grace have passed that line of fixed character beyond which there is no change. Zeph. 1:14, 15; Rev. 14:9, 10; 15:1; 22:11, 12. That day will not be ushered in by heavenly trumpet or heavenly glory; the careless sin lover will not know when it comes, even as the careless householder knows not the approach of the thief. 2 Peter 3:10. But the waiting, watching, faithful child of God will know. See Rev. 3:1.

2. "When they shall say." Note that it is not a prediction of peace and safety to come; it is proclaimed to be present. See Isa. 2:3-5; Rev. 18:7.

3. The children of light are those who are by faith begotten of Christ Jesus the Light of the world, born of the Spirit of light, filled with the Light of the world, and are shining for God, witnesses of the glory of His goodness. See John 12:36; 8:12; 1 John 1:7; Ps. 119:105; 2 Peter 1:19; Matt. 5:16.

4. The earth is in the darkness of the night of sin. And even as in the physical world, it is a time of revelry, drunkenness, and stupid slumber. While God's people as pilgrims are passing through this dark world, God gives them light. They carry the day with them. When darkness covered Egypt, there was light in the Israelites' dwellings. So when spiritual darkness settles upon the people of the earth, there will be a light within and upon the faithful of God. See Isa. 60:1, 2.

5. The breastplate of faith and love is the same as the shield of faith and the breastplate of righteousness. Eph. 6:14, 16. The hope of salvation is placed in the helmet, over the brain, the seat of the mind, not over the heart, the organ of feeling or emotion. God would have His children possess an intelligent hope.

6. Most precious assurance does God give His children. He has not appointed us to wrath. If we reap wrath, it will be because we have chosen it. He has appointed us to salvation. Nothing in all the universe will prevent its consummation but our own choice. Living, we may be His. Dying, we may be. Sleeping or waking, dying or living, if we are His, we are safe. The love of Christ covers all else but the sin that we love. Rom. 8:38, 39. The child of God who would be discouraged because of death has here a message of hope and cheer. Jesus Christ lives; in Him is all our hope.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest."
