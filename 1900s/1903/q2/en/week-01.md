# Lesson 1 — The Founding of the Church

April 4, 1903

## 1 Thess. 1; Acts 17:1-10

"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace."

"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: (2) and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures, (3) opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ. (4) And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. (5) But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathered a crowd, set the city on an uproar: and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people. (6) And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; (7) whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. (8) And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. (9) And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. (10) And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews."

## Notes

1. It is generally agreed that the earliest epistle written by the apostle Paul was the first to the Thessalonians, about A.D. 52, the second epistle from one to two years later. The burden of the first epistle is the reception and power of the gospel message, the second coming of Christ, and the necessity of holiness and watchfulness. In the second epistle the apostle corrects wrong views obtained regarding the time of Christ's coming, foretells the great apostasy, and exhorts to practical godliness. Both epistles are eminently present truth to the people of God now. In the study of the lessons, above all things else study the epistle, and receive it, as it is in truth the Word of the Lord.

2. "Silvanus" is identical with Silas, a shorter form of the same word. He was a leading man and prophet in the church in Jerusalem (Acts 15:22, 23), his name indicating that he was a Grecian Jew. He was chosen by the apostles to accompany Paul, to bear the message of the first council to the churches. Acts 15. Afterwards he labored with Paul, and was with him in some of his greatest trials. After Paul's imprisonment, he seems to have joined Peter. Timothy's father was a Greek, and his mother a Jewess of Lystra. He was converted under Paul's preaching, and proved a faithful soldier of God.

3. Thessalonica was an important city of Macedonia. It was named after Alexander's sister by Cassander, her husband. In Paul's time it was a free city of the Romans, the capital of one of the four Roman divisions of Macedonia. Like other ancient cities, it was full of idolatry. It is now known by the abbreviated name Salonika. Its commerce is extensive with many nations. The population is about 80,000, of whom 30,000 are Jews and 10,000 Greeks. It contains many churches and schools of different denominations, and ought to be a good missionary center.

4. The burden of Paul's preaching always was what is ever the only remedy for man's great need,—Jesus Christ crucified and risen.

5. The word "rulers" is in the original "politarchs," not elsewhere found in the New Testament; but the word is found on the ruins of a triumphal arch in the city, and the names of seven politarchs given, an undesigned coincidence witnessing to the truth of the epistle.
