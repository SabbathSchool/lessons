# Lesson 3 â€” The Manner of the Preacher

April 18, 1903

## 1 Thess. 2:1-12

"(1) For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found in vain: (2) but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict. (3) For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: (4) but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts. (5) For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness; (6) nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ. (7) But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children: (8) even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us. (9) For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. (10) Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe: (11) as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, (12) to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into His own kingdom and glory."

## Notes

1. When the grace of the gospel of God came to the apostle Paul, it came "not in vain." It was revealed not only to him, but in him. Gal. 1:16. The proof that it was not in vain was the service he rendered for God: "I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me." 1 Cor. 15:10.

2. These things in the negative imply their positives. His exhortation was not of error; it was therefore of truth. It was not of uncleanness. It was unlike the teaching of paganism, in which licentiousness and lewdness were taught as a part of its abominable nature worship, and which is ever regarded lightly by carnal man where the rays of the gospel have not shown. He taught purity of motive, of heart, of thought, of word, of life. He was without guile. He did not hide the principles of God's truth; he did not need to. The blessed things of Christianity are not a cloak to deceive, a fair thing to hide something which will not bear the light. Paul did not teach thus, though he was so charged with doing. He shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God.

3. That they who preach the gospel shall live of the gospel, is apostolic and divine. Paul brought to the Thessalonians the higher life; surely he had a right to partake of their things which supported the physical man. But he did not do it. He did not seek glory from them or from others, nor was he burdensome. His course was an example of unselfishness, and it demonstrated that he did not break from traditional Judaism and become a Christian for gain. But it is the duty of the church to remedy this by supporting the servants of God. The unselfishness of the servant of God should not develop unhospitable, selfish churches.

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
