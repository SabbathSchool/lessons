## Notes

1. Temptation is not sin, but the moment we allow an insinuation of doubt to find a lodging-place in the heart, and begin to parley with the tempter—begin to reason that, perhaps, the wicked thing is right—we are on the enemy's ground; and by his cunning and deception, practised for six thousand years, he will make wrong appear right. The Lord has given us one sure and safe weapon with which we can successfully meet every temptation of Satan, "It is written." That weapon of defense has been tested and proved by One who met and conquered in every temptation that can ever come to humanity.

2. The whole plan of human redemption, which is revealed in the Bible, and which "will be the song and the science of the redeemed throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity," is included in the promise of the seed which was to bruise the serpent's head. Adam had gone into bondage to Satan, and had forfeited to him all the rulership and dominion with which he had been entrusted. This promise of the seed is a pledge to the universe that God will never relinquish His kingship of this world. That kingship, perpetuated through the promised Seed, will be the central thought running through this quarter's lessons.

*The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.*
