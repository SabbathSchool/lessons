## Notes

1. Prophecy has declared that the scepter should not depart from Judah until Shiloh should come. Genesis 49:10. While, because of rebellion against God, the throne was to remain vacant, the kingly line was still preserved in Judah until Shiloh came.

2. The prophecy of Amos 9:11 was spoken nearly two hundred years before the reign of Zedekiah. It would have been fulfilled literally to that people if they had been true Israelites.

3. Note the argument of the apostle. He says that taking out of the Gentiles a people for His name agrees with all that the prophets have spoken on that subject. He then quotes the prophecy of Amos 9:11 as a sample of what the prophets have spoken concerning the re-establishment of David's throne.
