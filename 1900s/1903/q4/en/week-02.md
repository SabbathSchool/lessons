## Notes

1. "Of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." 2 Peter 2:19. Through the sin of Adam and Eve, the whole human race was involved in bondage to Satan. "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." John 8:34. By bringing Adam into bondage to himself, and usurping his rulership and dominion, Satan gained the position of "prince of this world." God had not given to Adam an absolute rulership of this world, and, as Adam could forfeit to Satan only that which had been entrusted to him, the great controversy through all the ages of sin has been, and will be till the close, between God and Satan as to whose rulership of this world will ultimately prevail. And as it was to be through the promised Seed that the rightful kingship was to be perpetuated in this world, the controversy has been directly between Christ and Satan.

2. The covenant which the Lord established with Noah, in preserving him alive to perpetuate the race, when he was about to destroy all flesh, was that recorded in Genesis 3:15, that "the Seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."

3. The Revised Version makes the meaning of verse 11 clearer: "Out of the land he [Nimrod] went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh."

4. The statement (Joshua 24:2) that Terah, the father of Abraham, dwelt on the other side of the flood, and the statement in verse 3, that Abraham was taken from the other side of the flood, should be understood as meaning the other side of the River Euphrates. The Revised Version renders it, "Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the river." See also Joshua 1:4.
