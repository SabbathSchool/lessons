# Lesson 7 — Changing the Law of the Kingdom

November 15, 1902

The little horn, the Papacy, antichrist, blasphemes the Most High, and wages war against the saints (Dan. 7:25), but the climax of his rebellious course is found in his purpose to change the law of God (same verse). This little horn was given special authority for a period of 1,260 years. Compare Dan. 7:25; Rev. 12:14, 6, and Rev. 13:5. See also Eze. 4:5, 6, and Num. 14:34. The beginning of this period was marked by the overthrow of the third of the "three kings" (Dan. 7:24), the Ostrogoths, March, A.D. 538, and its close by the capture of Pope Pius Sixth by the French army under General Berthier, A.D. 1798.

The actual change made in the law of God by the little horn, the Papacy, may be seen by comparing the ten commandments as found in Exodus 20 with the ten commandments as found in the standard Catholic catechisms. For convenience of reference the ten commandments, as they appear in the "General Catholic Catechism," are printed here:—

"1. I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt not have any strange gods before Me. 2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. 3. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. 4. Honor thy father and thy mother. 5. Thou shalt not kill. 6. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 7. Thou shalt not steal. 8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 9. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. 10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods."

This change in God's law, without regard to its special character and significance, is equivalent to a declaration of independence of God, and is an act of high treason against the sovereignty of God. It is important, however, that we should study the significance of the specific change which has been made.

By the term "the Sabbath day," in the third commandment, the Papacy means the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. The Roman Catholic Church acknowledges that it has made this change, and claims the power to do so. The following extract is from the "Doctrinal Catholic Catechism," page 173: "Q.—Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept? A.—Had she not such power . . . she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority." "The observance of Sunday is solely a law of the Catholic Church." (Father Enright, Feb. 22, 1884.) "The Catholic Church, . . . by virtue of her divine mission, changed the day from Saturday (the seventh day) to Sunday (the first day of the week)." ("Catholic Mirror," Sept. 23, 1893.) All standard Catholic works endorse these claims.

Now the Sabbath of the Lord is a sign between the Lord and His people, based upon the fact of creation. Ex. 31:17. This creative work was wrought through Him who afterwards took the flesh. John 1:1-3, 14. Redemption is a creative work (Eph. 2:10), and our hope of redemption is based upon the fact that the Redeemer is the Creator (Col. 1:14-17, R.V.). Compare Isa. 43:1. This creative power works salvation for those only who believe (Rom. 1:16), in whose hearts the creative Presence dwells (Eph. 2:22; 3:17). It therefore follows that "the Sabbath of the Lord is the sign of what Jesus Christ is to those who believe in Him. The observance of it by faith—the true observance of it—brings into the life of the believer in Jesus, as nothing else can, the living presence and power of Jesus Christ." But this is simply the experience of justification by faith. To the believer, therefore, the Sabbath of the Lord is the sign of justification by faith. When the Papacy perverted Christianity by separating Jesus Christ, Creator and Redeemer, from sinful flesh and substituted justification by works (self salvation) for justification by faith (salvation through the indwelling presence of Jesus Christ), it substituted the sign of its own power, the first-day sabbath, for the sign of the Lord's power in salvation, the seventh-day Sabbath. The Papacy has put man in the place of God (2 Thess. 2:3, 4), humanity in the place of Divinity. It has put tradition in the place of the Word of God; it has substituted justification by works for justification by faith, and has thus changed the law of faith into the law of works. In harmony with all this it has changed the written law of God, and has substituted a spurious sabbath, the sign of its pretended power, in the place of the true Sabbath, the sign of the genuine, creative power of God unto salvation. What more could the little horn do to hinder the purpose of God to establish His kingdom in the hearts of men through their faith in His gift of His Son to the human family?
