## Notes

The judgment scene here described is evidently the same as the one mentioned in Rev. 20:11-13, where it is stated that "the dead were judged." It is the great assize of the world, when all that have lived upon the earth have a case in court. The time of the sitting of this final court of award is not given here, but will appear from other prophecies.

The little horn is so closely identified with the fourth beast that when the attention of the prophet is called to it by reason of the great words which it spoke, he noted the slaying of the beast and the burning of his body.

A remarkable person is here introduced in the vision. He is none other than the Son of man. The kingdom given to Him, "which shall not be destroyed," is evidently the same as the fifth kingdom of the second chapter, "which shall never be destroyed." Compare Rev. 11:15, R.V.

The kingdom which is said in verse 14 to be given to the Son of man is said in verse 18 to be taken by the saints of the Most High. Thus it appears that when the kingdom is given to the Son of man it is given to the saints in Him. Compare Rev. 3:21.

Babylon took the kingdom, but could not retain it. Medo-Persia then took the kingdom, but could not retain it. Grecia followed, and then Rome, but neither of them could retain the kingdom. What these great kingdoms could not do with all their power, the saints of the Most High are to do by the power of faith in Christ Jesus. 1 John 5:4.

The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
