# A Very Timely Book

## Outlines of Modern Science and Modern Christianity

By Geo. E. McCready Price

It takes the Biblical side of the pending "Science-versus-Religion" Controversy, and clearly establishes the primitive Christian principles of TRUE science.

The consistency and clearness of the author's logic and the grand themes with which he deals can not fail to interest and benefit all readers, old and young.

We earnestly recommend it to all who have, at any time, been tempted to question the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures.

# For Missionary Work

As a means of interesting people in the truth for this time, the package system of using tracts has proven very successful, and as the fall and winter months are coming on, we hope our people generally will take up this line of work.

For your convenience we give below a series of four packages which we regard as very good in introducing present truth.

## PACKAGE NO. 1
- An Astronomer's View - A.G.L. No. 66, 1½c
- Without Excuse - B.S.L. 46, ½
- Benefits of Bible Study - A.G.L. 10, ½
- Coming of the Lord - A.G.L. 40, ½

## PACKAGE NO. 2
- Heralds of His Coming - A.G.L. 51, 1½
- God's Message for To-day - B.S.L. 81, ½
- How Esther Read Her Bible - A.G.L. 7, ½

## PACKAGE NO. 3

The plan is to have the packages enclosed in a neat envelope, with a few printed words of explanation on the outside. Leave No. 1 with your reader for a week or ten days. Then call with No. 2, taking up the first package, and so on through the series. By the time No. 4 is reached, your reader will no doubt be enquiring for further light on some special subject, and you will need to be supplied with a complete list from which to make selections.

This is only one plan. There are many ways of using tracts. You will do well to keep a supply always on hand, asking the Lord to direct you in using them.

Your State Tract Society can furnish you with the above tracts, envelopes, and lists, and will be glad to aid you in any way possible. Write them to-day.
