## Notes

From the definiteness of the inquiries concerning the fourth beast and the ten horns, and especially concerning the little horn, it is evident that this part of the vision made the deepest impression upon the mind of the prophet. Here, then, we may expect to find the objective point of the vision. The first three kingdoms serve as so many stepping-stones to reach and locate the fourth kingdom. The little horn is closely identified with the fourth beast, and yet it has an independent history and work. The career of the little horn in its work of opposition to the establishment of the fifth kingdom, the kingdom of the Most High, is presented with a fulness of description which makes it clear that this is the main theme of the vision. The fourth kingdom is Rome. The ten horns are the ten kings or kingdoms which arose in the territory of Rome as the result of the inroads of the barbarians. This was accomplished between A.D. 395 and A.D. 476. "The ten [kingdoms] are the Alemanni, the Franks, the Burgundians, the Suevi, the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Saxons, the Ostrogoths, the Lombards, and the Heruli." ("Great Empires of Prophecy," page 677.) "After them" rose the little horn, which subdued three kings. "The three that were plucked up by the roots were the Heruli, the Vandals, and the Ostrogoths; and the date of the plucking up of the first of the three is March 5, A.D. 493, and of the last, March, A.D. 538." (Id., page 680.) Dr. L. Gaussen gives the following fourteen marks by which it can be demonstrated that the little horn is the Papacy: (1) A priest-king; (2) the location of its territory; (3) its origin and growth; (4) the time of its rise; (5) the territory acquired; (6) its sagacity; "in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man;" (7) its deceivableness; (8) its unusual pomp; (9) its language; (10) the duration of its blasphemies; (11) the character of its blasphemies; (12) its persecution of the saints; (13) its heresies, its attempted change of the law; (14) the exact length of its power.

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
