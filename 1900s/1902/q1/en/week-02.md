## Notes

It is evident that this parable deals with the final call to the gospel feast of those who had previously been invited; and of the way in which they treated this call. The suggested future happiness of those who should "eat bread in the kingdom of God" led to this instruction and furnishes a simple basis for understanding its meaning. The Lord rained "bread from heaven" for His people (Ex. 16:4), that they might learn that feeding upon His Word was the real means of sustaining life. Deut. 8:3. On this basis the gospel invitation had been sounded through the prophet Isaiah (Isa. 55:1-3), with the promise of "the sure mercies of David." This was the promise of eternal life through faith in Christ (Ps. 89:28, 29), who was "born of the seed of David, according to the flesh."

When the Word "became flesh, and dwelt among us," He said: "The bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world... I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever." John 6:33, 51. Thus it is evident that when "they did all eat the same spiritual food," they were feeding upon Christ, just as "they drank of that spiritual Rock that went with them; and that Rock was Christ." 1 Cor. 10:4. And so the provision for the gospel feast is Christ Himself, who has been given for us and to us.

The eating of this "bread of life" is not to be deferred until the setting up of the kingdom of God, but the call to the feast must be heeded here or that future happiness will never be realized. This is the emphatic teaching of this parable.

Those who were bidden to the feast were so much occupied with various temporal matters that they treated as of trifling importance the final call of the host. What a true picture of the present danger! Luke 21:34. No earthly possession or earthly tie should be allowed to keep us away from Christ (Luke 14:33; Matt. 19:29), and the most diligent attention to worldly interests will not be a valid excuse for neglecting the gospel call. Read Luke 10:38-42.

"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."
