# The HOME

We are planning on making the Home Department of the Signs of the Times for the next year just as practical, helpful, and interesting as possible. We are securing many original articles from men and women of wide experience in different phases of the world's work, some of which are as follows:â€”

Under the general heading of "Plain Talks on Health and Hygiene" there will be given the value of different baths, simplicity in diet, the evils of such bad habits as hasty eating, hot foods, soda and seasoning, drinking at meals, tea, coffee, and tobacco using.

Practical suggestions will be given on ventilation, while the blessings of sunshine, pure water, pure food, and the hygiene of hopefulness will all receive due attention.

Talks to the father, to the mother, to the parents, to the boys, to the girls, and to the family, will be features in which our readers will be much interested. Other writers will speak of economy in the home, beauty and simplicity in the home, and the care of children. There will also be the usual number of unusually good stories.

Sample copies will be sent free to those asking for them.

# A Boon to the Isolated Missionary Worker
## And a Help to All

Hereafter the isolated missionary worker and the small church will be supplied with the Signs at the same price as the largest church. That rate is seventy cents per copy in clubs of five or more.

This is an important change, and certainly one which will appeal to thousands of our brethren and sisters who can not secure papers through a large club, and can not afford to subscribe for a few copies at the rates which have been in force heretofore.

It will also recommend itself to members of large churches who take five or more copies through their church clubs, inasmuch as they may now receive them direct from this office. It is true the rate on these large clubs will be slightly increased, but the greater convenience of a personal club, and the knowledge of the fact that their small financial loss is the gain of the isolated member, will outweigh the increased expense.

## Another Aid

From any one who is taking a club of five papers, we will accept single additional subscriptions at the rate of 83 cents per year. In other words we will charge only the club rate of 70 cents per year plus the cost of sending out such single subscriptions separately, which is one-fourth cent each, or 25 cents per hundred. This offer will greatly help those who are engaged in missionary correspondence, who only wish papers sent to individuals a month or six weeks. Often the person to whom such papers are sent, if written to with the first copy, will either write his appreciation of the paper or refuse to accept it within that time, in which case it may be changed to another name without additional cost.

Then again, there are many churches that would gladly use larger clubs if they did not have to pay a cent a copy postage. If such will send in lists of names to which they wish papers sent, we will address, wrap, and mail such papers for 25 cents extra per hundred, or will furnish the papers and send them out for $1.60 per hundred.

To make this missionary feature as helpful and practical as possible, we have secured the services of an experienced man in tract and missionary work, a man in fact who has been laboring in a state tract society office for eight years, to take the immediate charge of all such lists of names and to make any suggestions to those sending them, which, according to his experience, would be most helpful. He will see that the papers are neatly addressed, carefully wrapped, and promptly mailed each week. Where sample copies are ordered out, he will have each marked "Sample Copy," and will attend to all other technicalities required by the post-office authorities. All these attentions to details will greatly help the appearance of the papers and add much to their influence. Thus we will attend to sending out the papers, and the worker will attend to the correspondence.

## Special Terms

We have not changed our special terms to those taking less than five papers. They are as follows:

One new yearly subscription and one renewal, or two new yearly subscriptions, sent at one time, $2.50.

Two new yearly subscriptions and one renewal, or three new yearly subscriptions, sent at one time, $3.25.

Three new yearly subscriptions and one renewal, or four new yearly subscriptions, sent at one time, $4.00.

## Special Agents

We have a class of agents who are selling one hundred or more copies of the Signs weekly, from house to house. The results of such work have been most excellent, and to encourage it all we can we have made a special rate of $1.00 per hundred. This is allowed only where one hundred or more are taken weekly, however. This rate will be continued.

## Co-operation

It is our desire to co-operate with those in the field, hence the foregoing plans. They will add much to our work here, but this we will look upon as our part, and will be done to the very best of our ability. Write to us.
