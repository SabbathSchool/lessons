## Note
By reading carefully the last fifteen verses of Matthew 19, the event which led up to this parable is made very plain. A rich young man, coming to Jesus, had been told, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow Me." The disciples were amazed at Jesus' comments concerning the rich, as they had been taught to look upon this class as favorites of heaven.

Peter immediately connected the action of the young man and Christ's words with their experience as disciples, and asked what they, who had forsaken all and followed Him, were to receive.

After a promise which breathes hope to every true disciple, Jesus illustrates by the parable of the laborers in the vineyard the true motive that should prompt all sacrifice. The reward is not of works, but of grace. "To him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness." Rom. 4:5. "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us." Titus 3:5.

"There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
