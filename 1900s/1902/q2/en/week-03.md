# Lesson 3 â€” The Great Controversy Transferred to the Earth

*April 19, 1902*

The controversy between Christ and Satan began in heaven (Rev. 12:7) in a face-to-face combat. Satan was not content with the position which he held as Lucifer (Isa. 14:12), or light-bearer, as the name signifies; but he indulged the ambition to "be like the Most High," and thus to be light itself (1 John 1:5) and the source of light. Since light is only a manifestation of life (John 1:4), this was the demand of a created being (Eze. 28:15) to be a source or fountain of life, which could only be granted to the begotten Son (John 5:26), one with the Father, the real Fountain (Ps. 36:9).

Having lost his place in heaven (Rev. 12:7, 8), Satan sought to establish his kingdom in the earth (verse 9). By falsehood (Gen. 3:4), and by transferring his own evil ambition into the human mind (verse 5), he changed a loyal servant of God into a servant of sin and himself (Rom. 6:16), usurped his dominion, and became prince of this world (John 12:31). Christ came to this world to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10. Thus the controversy which was begun in heaven was transferred to this earth. There it was the question of the supremacy of God, through His Son, in heaven; here it is the same question in its relation to man and the earth. Shall the government of God be sustained in the earth, or shall Satan establish an independent kingdom? The Son of God, as Michael, the leader of the angels, conquered Satan in heaven (Rev. 12:7-9), and then, in behalf of man, He undertook, as the Son of man, to conquer him on earth, and thus to vindicate the righteousness and justice of the government of God, the everlasting King. This is the gospel of the kingdom. It means a Saviour in our flesh (Luke 2:10, 11), to save from sin (Matt. 1:21), to be the channel of life to man (John 10:10), to destroy the devil (Heb. 2:14), bringing the restoration of all things (Acts 3:19-21), and giving to God His rightful place (1 Cor. 15:28).
