# Lesson 12 — Building the House of David

*June 21, 1902*

Through the tabernacle and its services God was teaching the mystery of godliness—God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15, 16), the King in His house. To show His purpose to identify Himself with His people, He occupied the same kind of a dwelling as they did (2 Sam. 7:6, 7), thus acting His word as an object lesson before them (2 Cor. 6:16; Heb. 2:14). Now, when David's heart is stirred to find out a settled place for the Lord (Ps. 132:3-5), the Lord reveals to him that He will build the house of David (2 Sam. 7:11, last clause); and make that His permanent home, through the relationship which He would establish with his family (verse 14, first clause).

The real house is the people (Isa. 58:1), and is thus equivalent to household (2 Tim. 4:19, A. V. and R. V.), or family (1 Chron. 13:14). To build a house was to bring a son into the family. Ruth 4:11. If a house continues forever, there must be a son in the family forever. When the Lord promised to establish David's house and David's throne forever (2 Sam. 7:16), He renewed the promise of the Seed (Gen. 3:15), and declared His purpose to give His eternal Son to David's family (Isa. 9:6, 7) to retain the flesh forever. This was the Seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:29), the Seed of David (Rom. 1:1-3), and the Son of both (Matt. 1:1). In Him Israel was brought into the relation of a son (Ex. 4:22; Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:14, 15), and the family on earth and the family in heaven were united (Eph. 3:14, 15). Read Luke 1:67-75.
