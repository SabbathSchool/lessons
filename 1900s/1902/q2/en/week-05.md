# Lesson 5 â€” The Gift of the Seed

*May 3, 1902*

The message for this generation is "the everlasting gospel" (Rev. 14:6), the one only gospel (Gal. 1:8), the gospel for all nations, as it was declared to Abraham (Gal. 3:8), and all contained in the original promise of the final triumph of the Seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15). We shall now study the development of this promise to its triumphant consummation in the present generation in the coming of the Seed (Gal. 3:19).

The Seed is the Word of God. Luke 8:11. This was the original Seed of all things (Gen. 1:1; Ps. 33:6; Heb. 11:3, first part), and was, therefore, Himself the Word of God, the Seed of the universe. Through Him all things came into being. John 1:3. All things were born (created) in Him. Col. 1:16, R. V. In Him was the creative or germinating principle (John 5:26), and the sustaining principle for all things (Col. 1:17, R. V.). As the Word of God, the Seed, all things, visible and invisible, were contained germinally in Him. All worlds and all powers were in the Seed of the universe. The gospel was not the revelation of a new power, but the new application of an old power (Rom. 1:16) to save from sin. In the giving of the Son of God to and for humanity, which was involved in the first announcement of the gospel (Gen. 3:15), the wonderful thing was not that He should be a Seed, for this He was already, but that the Seed of the universe should condescend to become the seed of the woman, the germ of a new humanity, was, even in the eyes of the heavenly host, an unparalleled exhibition of love (John 3:16). This is the condescension which makes us great. Ps. 18:35, R. V., margin. This is the unspeakable gift. 2 Cor. 9:15.
