# Lesson 1 â€” The Gospel of the Kingdom and the Coming of the Lord

*April 5, 1902*

The coming of the Lord and the end of the world are inseparably connected (Matt. 24:3), and a definite work is to be done as the preparation for these events (verse 14). This is the gospel of personal experience (Luke 17:20, 21), and involves the doing of God's will (Matt. 6:10). It gives to God His rightful place (Jer. 10:10), and recognizes the exalted position of Jesus Christ (1 Tim. 6:14, 15). It sets forth true humility as the basis of its citizenship (Matt. 18:3, 4), and makes service to be true worship (Matt. 4:10). It shows upon what the dominion is based (Heb. 1:8), and the worthy objects of man's desire (Matt. 6:33).

There is only one gospel (Gal. 1:8), and this was preached to Abraham (Gal. 3:8), and involved the coming of Christ in the flesh as his seed (verse 16). Wherever the gospel is mentioned, therefore, it is this same gospel of the kingdom, the gospel of righteousness by faith, the gospel of the gift of the Son of God to the human family. See, Rom. 1:1-4, 16, 17.

Just before the coming of the Lord this gospel is to be preached to all the world (Rev. 14:6) in a threefold message, directing all to the worship of the Creator (verse 7), setting forth the result of turning from this true worship (verse 8), warning against the worship of the beast and his image (verses 9, 10), and showing the result of accepting this gospel message (verse 12). When the gospel of the kingdom, as set forth in these verses, has been preached in all the world, the Lord will come (verse 14), and the harvest of the earth will be reaped (verse 16; Matt. 13:39).

## Suggestions for Study

Hold closely in your study to the line of thought suggested in the lesson. There are many other things taught in these texts, but they are used in this lesson to develop a special theme.
