## NOTES

1. Daniel and his companions had been under training for a definite purpose. The Lord had a message for Babylon, and it was to be given in the court of the king. "As Israel had lost the power to arrest and command the attention of all the nations, that the nations might consider God and His wonderful ways and works with the children of men, God would now use them to enlighten those who had acquired the power to arrest and command the attention of all the nations, and thus cause all nations to consider the wonderful ways and works of God with the children of men."—Great Empires of Prophecy, pp. 6, 7. By the training which they had received, these young captives had been prepared to stand before the king, that they might impart in his own language the knowledge of the true God and His working among men.

2. God purposes to demonstrate in Babylon that the wisdom of men is foolishness with Him, that true wisdom comes from Him alone, and that it is imparted to man through the indwelling of the divine life as the wisdom. The failure of the Chaldeans to meet the demands of the king, made it clear that all their pretensions of being the channel of communication through which could come knowledge which was otherwise unattainable was all a sham. To justify their failure they declared that only the gods could do what they were asked to do, and even in this there was no hope, from the Babylonish standpoint and experience, because, they declared, their "dwelling is not with flesh." This is the creed of Babylon. This is the teaching and experience of heathenism. And a professed Christianity which does not bring this experience into the life is no better than heathenism.

3. The original promise in which the gospel was first preached (Gen. 3:15) was the promise of the union of Divinity with humanity in the flesh, and this is the essence of Christianity. Daniel and his companions are in Babylon to teach this very truth, and the opportunity has now come in God's own providence. According to the statement of the Chaldeans themselves, the ability to reveal the dream and its interpretation as demanded by King Nebuchadnezzar, would be equivalent to the demonstration of the fact that God dwells with flesh. That which they put forward as an excuse for their own failure will be the highest testimony to the truth of the experience which they deny to the flesh,—the indwelling of God in the flesh of sinful man. Thus the truth is set forth that "their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges."
