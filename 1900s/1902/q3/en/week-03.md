# Lesson 3 - THE CURSE OF FORMALISM

July 19, 1902

The position of God's chosen people was one of privilege (Rom. 3:1, 2), and, therefore, of corresponding responsibility (Amos 3:1, 2). Because they would not serve Him and thus make known to the nations His great name and the gospel of His kingdom (Ps. 145:10-13), they lost their place among the nations (Deut. 28:47, 48). But God's purpose was unchanged. When His people, as an organized body, refused to be a channel for the gospel to the nations, and sought to cover their sins under the cloak of Pharisaism, glorying in the holy city, the holy temple, and the holy land, the Lord took from them all these outward evidences of the covenant promise, that they might learn how to worship Him (John 4:23, 24), and that some of them, as captives, might do what the nation had failed to do as conquerors. Those who knew the spiritual nature of the kingdom of God, as Daniel and his companions did, could be used to proclaim the gospel as a living experience.

More than a century before it came upon them the Lord had specifically warned His people of the result of their hypocrisy (Isa. 29:13, 14), and only a few years before the captivity He had made it still more definite (Hab. 1:5, 6). Their own sinful course had brought its sure result. 1 Chron. 9:1. They lost the Jerusalem experience before they lost the visible city. Dan. 9:16. They lost the reality of the sanctuary services before they lost the visible temple. Jer. 7:8-14. It was serving strange gods in their own land which scattered them in a strange land. Jer. 5:10. Thus was being emphasized the truth concerning the real dwelling-place of God (Acts 7:48), and the folly of glorying in anything except a personal knowledge of God was made plain (Jer. 9:23, 24). Under these circumstances occurred those events which are recorded in the book of Daniel.
