# Lesson 13 - THE MESSAGE OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH WILL ESTABLISH THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM

September 27, 1902

The day of wrath, now near at hand, will test the stability of character. Rev. 6:15-17. Ungodliness is the object of God's wrath. Rom. 1:18. Therefore the ungodly will not endure the test. Ps. 1:5. The gospel is God's provision through which and in which we may be able to stand. 1 Cor. 15:1, 2. This means a present victory over Satan (Eph. 6:11), which will result in our being able to stand permanently (verses 13, 14). This is simply the experience of justification by faith (Rom. 5:2), and this is the only experience which will enable us to stand when the Lord comes. The whole experience is one of faith on our part (Rom. 11:20) and of manifested power on God's part (Rom. 14:4, R.V.). It is, therefore, abundantly evident that "the everlasting gospel" in the threefold message of Rev. 14:6-12, which is to prepare for the coming of the Son of man as king (verse 14) must be the original gospel of the coming of the Seed, the gospel of the "unspeakable gift" of Jesus in the flesh as our righteousness, the gospel of justification by faith. And through the giving of this message in the earth "in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which... shall stand forever."
