# Call to Remembrance

The valuable help rendered you in the study of the Sabbath-school lessons on the Exodus, two years ago, by the book

## Patriarchs and Prophets

For there is now a grand opportunity for you to pass the "help" along to others.

The Sunday-school lessons studied in the orthodox churches during the last half of this year are on the same subjects, and all teachers and scholars should have this book.

Agents are wanted everywhere to take up its sale at this opportune time.
