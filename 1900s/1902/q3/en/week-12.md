# Lesson 12 - JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH, THE BASIS OF THE CONTINUANCE OF THE KINGDOM

September 20, 1902

The reality of the kingdom of God is found in spiritual principles rather than in material things. Rom. 14:17. The kingdom is to be established within. Luke 17:20, 21. Its scepter is a scepter of righteousness. Heb. 1:8. On this basis shall the rule be established. Isa. 32:1. This righteousness is everlasting. Ps. 119:142. This righteousness is brought to man in the gift of Jesus the Messiah (Dan. 9:24, 25), who is Himself righteousness (Jer. 23:6). His coming is the coming of the kingdom. Mark 1:14, 15. In His continuance as the seed is bound up the continuance of the kingdom. Ps. 89:3, 4, 29, 35, 36. In Him as the seed, the kingdom and the house of David would be established forever. 2 Sam. 7:12, 13, 16, 26. The same righteousness which is the scepter of the kingdom is revealed in the gospel as its power. Rom. 1:16, 17. This righteousness is a gift. Rom. 5:17. It is received through faith in Christ. Rom. 3:21, 22. And this is the faith through which we are justified. Gal. 2:16. Thus it is evident that the stability of the kingdom rests upon the stability of character (Ps. 111:3); that on God's part this stability of righteousness has been provided for us in the gift of Christ to the flesh (1 Cor. 1:30); that on our part we avail ourselves of this provision, and so become righteous (justified) in His sight through faith in Christ (Rom. 3:24-26). The testimony to the genuineness of this experience is found in the law (Rom. 3:21), which is established by our faith (verse 31). Thus the whole basis for the stability, the enduring character, the continuance of the kingdom of God, is found in the experience of justification by faith. This is the gospel of the kingdom which "shall stand forever."
