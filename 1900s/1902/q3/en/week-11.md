# Lesson 11 - THE SECRET OF CONTINUANCE

September 13, 1902

There is only one subject for the servant of the Lord to present to the people (Eph. 6:19), and only one purpose in presenting that subject (Eph. 3:8, 9). This is the secret or mystery which was made known to Daniel in the night vision that he might make it known in Babylon. It means the gift of the only-begotten Son to save men from perishing. John 3:16. It means the gift of eternal life in the gift of that Son. 1 John 5:11, 12. This means the bringing into the mortal flesh the power to "stand forever," and this is the secret of the everlasting continuance of the kingdom of God.

This everlasting continuance of the kingdom of God is assured by the everlasting continuance of Him in whom and through whom it is established. This will be clear from the consideration of a few scriptures. The first chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews is devoted to setting forth the exalted character of the person of the Son. In developing this theme seven quotations are made from the Old Testament. One of these quotations is from Ps. 102:25-27. One sentence of this passage in verse 26 reads as follows: "They shall perish, but thou shalt endure." In the margin we have the word "stand" in place of the word "endure." When this passage is quoted in the first chapter of Hebrews it is rendered, "They shall perish; but thou remainest." In the Revised Version it is rendered, "They shall perish; but thou continuest." Thus we have the words "endure," "stand," "remain," and "continue," to which may be added the word "abide," all of which are used in our English Bible to express the idea of continuance. Everlasting continuance is a fundamental element in the revelation which God has made to us of His being. His very name, "I AM," signifies it. He proposed to share this everlasting continuance (eternal life) with man by sharing His own character (glory) with him (Ps. 8:5), but man lost this character (glory) through sin (Rom. 3:23). The gospel of the kingdom is "the gospel of the glory of the blessed God" (1 Tim. 1:11, R.V.), restored to man in and through the gift of the Son of God to the human family (John 17:22). The only-begotten Son ranked with the Father in the eternity of His being. John 5:26; 8:35, last clause. Although the Jews entertained many erroneous views concerning Christ, the Messiah, and His mission to this earth, yet they saw clearly this teaching of the Scripture concerning His everlasting continuance. John 12:34. In giving His Son to the human family, and sending Him here to establish His kingdom in the earth, God made the provision for the everlasting continuance of that kingdom by providing everlasting continuance (eternal life) for all who would receive the gift of His Son (John 1:11, 12) and share with Him in His righteous character. This is the mystery of the kingdom of God. This is the secret of the everlasting continuance of that fifth kingdom, of which it was said, "It shall stand forever." Dan. 2:44.
