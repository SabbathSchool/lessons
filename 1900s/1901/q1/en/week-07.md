# LESSON 7 - SOWING AND REAPING

February 16, 1901

(Gal. 6:6-10, R. V.)

"Let him that is taught in the Word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. And let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. So then as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith."

## NOTES

1. There is probably no one who has ever read the sixth chapter of Galatians who has the slightest doubt that the exhortations in verses 1, 9, 10 are addressed personally to us, or that the statement in verse 8 is of universal application. This should show us that the whole epistle concerns us. The same conditions exist to-day, and all the instruction is as applicable to us, and as necessary, as it was to the Galatians. The question is between faith which works, and works which produce nothing, and is as vital a one to-day as it ever was.

2. "Communicate." Have in common. Compare 1 Cor. 9:7-14; 2 Cor. 9:1-8. From these it is very evident that the reference is to the sharing of temporal goods with those who are instructors in the Word. We do not buy our way to the favor of God. True giving is the result of the grace of God already in the heart. The brethren in Macedonia, who are presented as models in Christian giving, "first gave their own selves to the Lord." 2 Cor. 8:1-5. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. Ps. 51:17. When this is present, God is "pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness." When this is absent, all gifts are an abomination to Him. Amos 5:22-24; Micah 6:6-8. True Christian giving,—giving because of love of the truth,—is therefore one form of sowing to the Spirit.

3. "God is not mocked." The Greek word here rendered "mocked" is not used elsewhere in the New Testament. It means "deceived," thrown off the track, just as our word "mocked" often does. See Matt. 2:16. Ananias and Sapphira tried to deceive the Lord, but failed. Acts 5:1-9.

4. There is great danger of becoming weary in well-doing, especially when we see no immediate fruit of our labor. We need to remember how patiently God waits upon us. He is continually supplying us with good things, yet very few appreciate His efforts sufficiently to thank Him. How often we ourselves have murmured when we ought to have been returning thanks! When men treat us with only a portion of the indifference and disrespect that we show to God, we say that they are unworthy, and are inclined to do nothing more for them; but God does not do that way with us. We are to learn patience from Him.

5. "In due season we shall reap." "Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days." Eccl. 11:1. "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good." Verse 6. "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him." Ps. 126:5, 6. There is no doubt about the reaping; it is sure. No act of kindness is ever wasted. God's Word shall not return to Him void, even though many to whom it is sent reject it. Christ did not die in vain. He gave Himself for all the world, and none of His love is thrown away. Every act done for love of God is sure to bear fruit to life eternal.

6. We are not to be partial in our good deeds. The household of faith standing nearest, will naturally be the first partakers of our service, but no opportunity to do good is to be slighted. Read Matt. 5:43-48. We are to do good "as we have opportunity." It is to be considered a privilege, not a task.

7. There is no doubt that in these verses the apostle is speaking of rendering temporal assistance; yet since no gift is recognized by the Lord unless it comes from the heart in which His love is shed abroad by the Holy Spirit, it is evident that what is said about sowing and reaping applies to every act of life. He who lives for the flesh, will reap only corruption; from the Spirit alone can life everlasting come.
