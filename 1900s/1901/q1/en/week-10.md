## NOTES

1. "Israel." Israel is a comprehensive term, including all God's people. The study of the book will show that the general term at the beginning includes not alone the people of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, but all who have come in among God's people from the Gentiles. See Rom. 9:6-8; Eph. 2:11, 12, 19, 20; 3:6.

2. "Jacob—Esau." It is not of the individual men, but of the characters represented by these men, that the prophet speaks. Despite all Jacob's imperfections, he believed God, and longed to be like Him. He finally obtained the victory, and became prevailer with God. His character was manifest in his descendants. God hated the selfish character of Esau, who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, whose descendants exercised intense hatred toward their brethren and rejoiced in their downfall. God loves the sinner that He may save him, but He hates of necessity the sin, and the character that is formed by cherishing sin. These men stand as types of characters in all ages—the one of the imperfect man who desires to reform, and does so by God's grace; the other of those who despise God's blessings and reject His character.

3. "In that ye say." They probably did not say it in words, but their deeds spoke more loudly. If it was worthy only of their poorest offering, of their unclean bread; surely it was contemptible and unclean. We have considered some of these verses out of order, so as not to repeat the same thoughts, but it is well to note the repetition. It shows how emphatically and clearly the Lord reveals their sin.

4. "Entreat the favor of God." God reproved that they might repent. It was not in His plan that they had failed and their trouble had come upon them. It was all by their means, and God could not accept of half-hearted service. The repentance must be deep and lasting.

5. "Oh, that there were one among you!" The Lord longed for one brave man, according to the Revised Version, who would rise up and close the house of God against the unholy, polluted, imperfect offerings, which were degrading God before the eyes of all that saw. God did not accept the imperfect, cheap offerings, and the fire upon His altar was kindled in vain.

6. "My name shall be great." (Margin.) God's name will be honored. He desires that it shall be honored by the holy, faithful, earnest, true lives of His people. If they will not do this, His name will not the less be honored. He will get honor from their unfaithfulness. He desired to be honored by Pharaoh's conversion, but Pharaoh would not have it thus, so God used his overthrow to honor Him. He longs to get honor and spread abroad His name through His people's success, but if He can not do this, He will get glory through their downfall.

## SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS

When was it that Edom was beaten down? What kind of offering does the Lord desire? What kind of offering did He make for us? If we have only the lame, yet give our best, will He not accept it? What is the state of our piety when the regular service of God becomes a "weariness"?# LESSONS FROM MALACHI

The name Malachi is a contraction of Malachijah, meaning "Messenger of Jehovah." The term indicates the prophet's office, rather than his name. He was Jehovah's last inspired messenger among the prophets of that age to announce the coming of God's great messenger. He reproves certain sins in the close of that age, which are paralleled by the same sins in the close of this age. The date was about B.C. 420 to 390. His work followed that of Nehemiah. The grand scope of the book will be developed in our study of its lessons.
