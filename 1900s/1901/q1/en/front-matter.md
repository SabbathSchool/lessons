# ARE YOU TAKING

"If any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not"

According to Testimony No. 33, page 216,  
"All our people should read it carefully."

Again on page 218 it is said  
"Let every worker for God comprehend the situation, and place the 'Sentinel' before our churches, explaining its contents and urging home the facts and warnings it contains."

The need was great when the Testimony was given; it is even greater now.  
How many will heed the warning?
