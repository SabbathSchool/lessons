# LESSON 2 - THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW

January 12, 1901

(Gal. 5:7-12, R. V.)

"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? This persuasion came not of Him that calleth you. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away. I would that they which unsettle you would even cut themselves off."

## NOTES

1. Verse 7 shows that in the beginning the Galatians obeyed the truth, that is, kept God's commandments through faith in Jesus. Now they were ceasing to obey. Professor Boise gives this rendering of the last part of the verse: "Who did hinder you from continuing to obey the truth?" Make special note of the fact that the seeking of righteousness by the law, through the flesh, results in disobedience to it. "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone." On the other hand, "the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith." Rom. 9:30-32.

2. "Then is the offense of the cross ceased." The Greek is skandalon, scandal. The preaching of the cross is to the Jews a stumbling-block, a scandal, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to those who believe, it is the power of God. 1 Cor. 1:23, 24. If Paul had preached circumcision, that is, justification by the law, through one's own efforts, there would have been no trouble with either Jew or Greek. The heathen would have applauded the high morality even of the law of God. Righteousness by works meets with universal acceptance. All men are willing to have as much righteousness as rests in the power of their own flesh. All systems of religion extol "morality," in name, but only the Christian religion has it in fact. It is only when Christ is preached, when it is shown that in the flesh dwelleth no good thing, and that all real righteousness must come from without as a gift, that men rebel. Their pride and self-confidence are wounded. To admit that they are nothing, and that Christ is all, is too much for them.

3. It is good always to believe the best concerning men. Love "thinketh no evil." Paul expressed his confidence that in spite of their error, the Galatians would still have no other mind than that of Christ. They wished to do right; they had a zeal of God, although not according to knowledge. Now that they were shown so plainly and so forcibly Christ as the only way of righteousness and life, he believed that they would again run into it.

4. Christ calls to liberty, not liberty to the flesh, but liberty from the flesh. Keep this distinction always in mind.

5. God is love, and His law, which is His life, is love. "Love is the fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10. Whenever men either wilfully or through ignorance depart from the law of God, the law of love, it is evident that dissensions must ensue. Then there is danger that they will devour one another, for having departed from God, they are doing the will of Satan, whose work it is to devour. 1 Peter 5:8. Love, the keeping of the commandments of God, "worketh no ill to his neighbor."

6. Love is the fulfilling of the law, and all is fulfilled in one word, even in this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." This is indeed the second of the two great commandments which sum up the whole law (Matt. 22:37-40), yet it comprises the whole law, because it is love, and love is of God. The man who loves his brother, must love God also, for without the love of God, he could have no love for anybody. He who loves at all loves all.
