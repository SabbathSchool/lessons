# LESSON 9 - GENERAL REVIEW

March 2, 1901

We have now devoted eight months to the study of the Epistle to the Galatians, and should, in that time have acquired a thorough acquaintance with it, since we have had an average of less than one verse a day. It ought, therefore, to be a pleasant task to review the whole epistle in one lesson. It is self-evident that if this is done no one can stop to go into details. That has been done in preceding lessons, and it is to be supposed that our knowledge of details is now sufficient to enable us to take in any chapter or even almost the whole epistle at a glance. It is to be hoped that the interest aroused by this study is so great that every one will make the epistle the subject of much more study in the time to come.
