## NOTES

1. "My messenger." Christ's messenger, John the Baptist. Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27. "The Lord, whom ye seek." Jesus Christ, the Desire of all nations. "Come to His temple." Including all His first coming, to the temple at Jerusalem, to the people of God, to the sanctuary on high, where He ministers His own life for His people, and confirms His covenant in every soul that accepts. "Behold, He cometh." His second coming, including the work of judgment, when He comes before the Father, as well as His appearing in glory.

2. "Abide." No one, save only in Christ's righteousness, may abide that day, or stand before Him acquitted in the judgment. That they may do it then, He is now like a refiner's fire to burn away all dross, like soap to cleanse. He is not only the fire through His Spirit, but He watches over the process, that the fire may not be too fierce, and yet that the dross may be consumed. "A refiner." When the refiner of silver can see his own image perfectly reflected in the molten metal, the silver is pure. So Christ waits, yea, even kindles the furnace fires, that the dross may be consumed. "Sons of Levi." God's own spiritual priesthood, of which Levi was a type.

3. "Therefore." It is because God does not change, because "His mercy endureth forever," that men are spared in their sins. Not until there is no hope, till the sinner identifies himself with the sin, does the sinner die.

4. "The curse" is not an arbitrary curse pronounced upon the disobedient. It inheres in the very transgression itself; and it keeps back the blessing of God, not alone from the transgressors, but from those associated with them in church capacity. They are diseased members, affecting the whole body, and not until they are separated or healed will the blessing of God come in its fulness.

## SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS

How much is a tithe? To whom does the tithe belong? God tests man in respect to time and means. What is a test with respect to time? What in respect to means? Where is the tithe to be brought? If after we have paid it honestly, it is wrongly used, shall we lose the blessing? What is the tithe?â€”A debt we owe? a self-assumed obligation? or God's share in the revenue of our partnership with Him?
