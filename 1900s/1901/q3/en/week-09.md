### NOTES

Read "Great Controversy," chap. 28; "Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 334, 385.

1. "The book of life;... the book of death.... These books are compared with the statute-book, the Bible, and according to that are they judged."—Early Writings, p. 43. "The book of death contains the evil deeds of the wicked, and the names of the wicked and their punishment."—Ibid, pages 43, 150.

2. The book of remembrance contains the "word of their testimony." Compare Mal. 3:16 with Rev. 12:11. The word of their testimony enables them to overcome.
