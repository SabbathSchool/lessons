The lessons on the sanctuary are concluded with this quarter. We trust they will be earnestly and prayerfully studied. The side texts to be studied with the questions are inclosed in parenthesis. While it is not expected that these will be studied as diligently as the other tests, we trust that no student will pass them by without due attention.
