## The Beautiful Little Self-Pronouncing Testament
*A copy of this excellent little book will be given during this quarter*

# TO EVERY NEW SUBSCRIBER TO "SIGNS OF THE TIMES"

During the year to come the Signs will have more than the usual number of valuable articles from its able contributors. Some of the following series already appearing are being highly appreciated: "Religious Liberty from a Biblical Standpoint," i.e., "The Origin of Government," "The Theocracy of Israel," "The Kingdom of Heaven," "Constitution and Laws of the Kingdom of Heaven," "The Apostles and the Powers That Be," etc.

The prophecies of Daniel and Revelation will receive special attention in a series of articles by M. C. Wilcox, the editor. No one can afford to miss these. Pastor R. S. Owen will contribute a rare treat to all lovers of the Bible in an exposition of the generally meagerly understood book of Zechariah. "The Sabbath Question" will receive the attention of A. O. Tait, the assistant editor, and J. A. L. Derby will consider "The Nature of Man, His Origin and Destiny," while from the pen of L. A. Phippeny will come interesting, instructive, and comforting words about the "Second Advent of our Lord."

The Sanctuary will receive special attention during the time when that subject is studied by our Sabbath-schools. Thus will the readers of the Signs receive each week, fresh and crisp, choice bits of instruction directly along the line of the Sabbath-school lessons. The paper will also continue to publish the Sabbath-school lessons and notes. Subscribe now and get them all.

Many are the good words we hear for the Signs. Space forbids our giving any of them here. The paper should certainly be in every home. Surely no one can afford to be without it if he has any desire to keep pace with this rapidly advancing message. Every one should read it for his own benefit and then hand it to his neighbor for his benefit.

# HOW TO USE TRACTS

GREAT responsibility rests upon us as a people because of the wealth of our literature.

Of English tracts alone we have almost two hundred and fifty different titles, covering a wide range of important subjects.

Our trade books now number over one hundred, exclusive of foreign editions, while our subscription volumes have almost reached the fifty mark.

This literature provides work for all; and especially is this true of the tracts which are now so low in price that no one can excuse himself from using them liberally. We should realize that these "silent messengers" are, in the hands of God, powerful agents for the conversion of souls and teaching the truth.

Far better will they do an effective work than can be done by argument; and, generally speaking, they will accomplish what one can seldom hope to accomplish in a conversation that must often be hurried or interrupted.

We trust that the suggestions contained in this leaflet may be of assistance to those who have wished to begin this line, but have perhaps hardly known how to begin; a helper even to the more experienced ones, and, if possible, a means of inducing others who have not labored for Him to heed the Master's command, "Go, work in My vineyard." The Saviour's rich blessing and commendation await all such.

The first plan that we will suggest is the most systematic, and has opened the way for the Bible worker and the minister in a remarkable manner. It is called

**The Package System**—Briefly this is as follows: A graduated list of tracts suitable for distribution is selected and arranged in packages enclosed in envelopes. On the envelope there is generally printed a statement that the tracts are loaned for a certain length of time, and that they will be called for. However, it is not necessary for these envelopes to be printed, nor is it really necessary that envelopes be used at all. The tracts may be handed out loose with a few pleasant words of greeting and a statement concerning the time at which they will be called for. But the envelope keeps them from becoming soiled, and the printed statement upon it assists those who have difficulty in talking to the people.

In this connection, the following suggestions for packages up to No. 4 will not be amiss:—

| Package | Title | Library & Number | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Package No. 1 | An Astronomers' View | A. G. L. 66 | ½c |
| | Without Excuse | B. S. L. 46 | ½c |
| | Benefits of Bible Study | A. G. L. 10 | ½c |
| | Coming of the Lord | A. G. L. 40 | ½c |
| Package No. 2 | Heralds of His Coming | A. G. L. 51 | 1½c |
| | God's Message for To-day | B. S. L. 81 | ½c |
| | How Esther Read Her Bible | A. G. L. 7 | ½c |
| | Labor and the Money Power | B. S. L. 160 | 2c |
| Package No. 3 | The Great Three-fold Message | A. G. L. 47 | ½c |
| | Winning of Margaret | A. G. L. 53 | 1½c |
| | How the Sabbath Came to Me | W. of T. 3 | 3c |
| | Unawares | A. G. L. 54 | ½c |
| Package No. 4 | Who Changed the Sabbath | B. S. L. 107 | 1½c |
| | The Way to Christ | B. S. L. 105 | 1c |
| | A Living Saviour | A. G. L. 60 | ½c |

After four packages are used the interested ones will probably call for light on special subjects. Those who have not become interested will not desire tracts longer; or, if they do, you can give them such as seem best to you.

As to the best way of following up this work, we would advise you as far as possible to follow up the interest yourself. It will, of course, be too much to expect that the reading matter of itself will always bring people into the truth. There are other essentials, and one of these is the witness of the Holy Spirit's power in your own life to emphasize the value of the publications, and to convince the parties to whom they are given that you believe fully the truths they contain, because you yourself have been benefited by them. This means on your part consecration and earnest study of the Word, with much prayer.

**The Correspondence Plan**—This is a method that can not be recommended too highly. The various publications in the Apples of Gold Library have been issued for this special purpose, and are particularly appropriate. Those who are mailing the Signs or other periodicals, and are corresponding with those to whom the papers are sent, will find these little Apples of Gold leaflets especially valuable. And then they may be enclosed in ordinary letters, inasmuch as they are all rich in spiritual thought and experience. A portion of the Words of Truth Series will also go into an ordinary envelope.

Besides this general plan of enclosing the leaflets in letters, use them with the plan adopted for mailing the Signs. Send tracts to names and addresses, accompanying the first ones with letters. Send one tract each week until five or six have been sent, then write another letter. Send to ministers, also to professional men and others in this way.

**Reading Racks**—People waiting for trains at depots are generally glad to get hold of almost anything to read. Trains are often late, and we have noted that usually where racks are kept up they are liberally patronized. There may be other public places, as hotels and halls or public buildings, where racks can be placed. Any small church or even an isolated individual may keep up a rack of this kind; and no one can estimate the good that may result therefrom. The writer of this series of suggestions has watched these racks very carefully in a large number of different places, and he has yet to see a single publication destroyed. We are personally acquainted with a blacksmith who kept a little reading rack in the rear of his shop; and as people waited for work to be done, he pointed the matter out to them. He bears witness to the fact that an immense amount of literature was taken and read, and some were converted through this means. God has said that His Word "shall not return unto Him void." Some day—it may not be until eternity—we shall see the fulfilment of this promise if we are faithful in scattering the Word.

**Miscellaneous Distribution**—"Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters." Isa. 32:20.

Under this heading we might speak at length concerning opportunities for the distribution of these silent messengers. But the opportunities are innumerable, and the servant of the Lord must be "instant in season and out of season." You talk with a friend, neighbor, or chance acquaintance about the terrible storms, the political upheavals, war, money matters, etc., and he shows his interest in these things. Take advantage of this interest, and hand him a tract like "Heralds of His Coming," "The Eastern Question," "Labor and the Money Power," or the pamphlet, "Marshaling of the Nations." The conversation you have had and the interest he has shown will insure the reading of a short treatise of this kind, and may do much toward bringing the truth to the individual. You may be riding on the train; leave a tract on the seat. You drop into the public library or reading room; leave one of the silent messengers on desk or table. You call at the busy man's office on business or at the store; leave a leaflet on the corner of the desk or show-case or counter. When you pass through the parks or squares, leave a tract here and there on the seats.

You may be a farmer going to town for your weekly supplies; take along some of the leaflets and place them in the wagons and buggies on the vacant lot. You may be a busy housewife; keep a few tracts at hand and give them to your neighbors as they call and visit you; carry the personal-contact idea still farther, and hand select tracts to people on the train or at the depot or on the boat. When you visit the hospitals, the asylums, or the prisons, give a few tracts to the inmates when you have opportunity, or place a few in the reading room or library. Surroundings and special calling will suggest other ways and plans.

**Some General Hints**—When you do not know that a person is interested, so far as consistent, use the smaller tracts. Select tracts dealing with the second coming of Christ or the unsettled condition of affairs at the present time. These are not likely to arouse prejudice. We would not advise introducing doctrinal subjects until your readers are somewhat acquainted with other literature. Use a plentiful supply of good, practical tracts, such as "He Saves to the Utmost," "Justification by Faith," "The Way to Christ," "What to Do with Doubt," "Jesus Died for You," "The Sure Promises of God," "The Benefits of Bible Study." Let your readers become impressed with the fact that Christ is all and in all, and that you are not anxious simply to convince people of doctrinal points. Be courteous, charitable, considerate, quiet, unobtrusive, giving no occasion for prejudice by word or manner. Above all things else, bear a personal witness to the saving power of Christ in your daily life. Without this everything else will be in vain.

**Supplies**—The matter of having a supply of tracts and leaflets to do this work is very important. It would be an excellent thing if every Seventh-day Adventist family could have at least one copy of every tract published, for study and reference. Then you will be able to judge quite well for yourself what will be best to use in a given case. If you can have them bound, so much the better.

We know, however, that many of our people do not have these tracts. Now to such and to all others who wish to take advantage of the offer, we will send complete sets of the Bible Students' Library (not including pamphlets) and Apples of Gold Library, together with a year's subscription to each library during 1901 for $1.00. This is a most liberal offer, and is made because of our interest in the good that may accrue to our own people in becoming active in this work, and the influence beyond in the great needy world, and not to any interest otherwise as publishers.

We will also furnish envelopes for package work with a good form of introduction and greeting printed thereon for fifty cents per hundred, post-paid.

Talk this matter over in the home, with your brethren and sisters, and in the church; and then let us unitedly "work while it is called to-day."

# Testimony for the Church
## NUMBER THIRTY-FOUR

The manuscript for this long-expected volume is now in the hands of the printers, and it is expected that books will be ready for delivery early in April. The instruction which it contains for the church is grouped into six departments, namely:

| Department Number | Title |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | THE OUTLOOK |
| 2 | EVANGELISTIC WORK | 
| 3 | EDUCATION |
| 4 | MEDICAL MISSIONARY WORK |
| 5 | CANVASSING |
| 6 | CAUTIONS AND COUNSELS |

During the ten years since "Testimony to the Church No. 33" was published many messages of counsel, warning, admonition, and exhortation have been given to the church. These have been read from manuscripts and booklets published for ministers. But the church members want them in book form for all to study. From the great wealth of instruction given, matter has been selected which makes a volume of over five hundred pages. It deals largely with present issues, and will be read with interest by every Seventh-day Adventist, and by many others.
