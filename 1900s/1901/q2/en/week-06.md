## Notes

1. By carefully comparing the statements in verses 9-18, it will be seen that the gate of the court was on the east end. This corresponded, of course, to the door of the tabernacle, which was at the east end in both the sanctuary which Moses built and the temple which Solomon built. See Eze. 8:16, and "Christ Our Advocate," pp. 20, 21.

2. The people came to the sanctuary, where God dwelt between the cherubim, through the gate or door of the court, by the altar of burnt-offering and the laver. So we come to the heavenly sanctuary, where God dwells, through Christ, who is the door (John 10:7, 9), the sin-offering (Heb. 9:13, 14; 10:10-14), that was slain at the altar of burnt-offering, and the living Word by which we are cleansed from sin (John 1:1; 15:3; 1 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 5:25, 26). Christ was symbolized by the smitten rock which gave water to the people in the wilderness. When Aaron and his sons were chosen for the priesthood, they were washed all over by Moses, who was a representative of Christ. The new birth is spoken of as the washing of regeneration. Titus 3:5. Ps. 119:9, 11 shows how we are cleansed by the Word.
