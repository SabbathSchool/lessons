## Notes

1. When we see sin losing its hold upon us, being reduced as it were to ashes, by the fire of the Holy Spirit, we may know that God is accepting our consecration, and that we are serving the true God. 1 Kings 18:24, 36-39.

2. This fire kindled by God, represented one phase of the work of the Holy Spirit. Matt. 3:11; Isa. 4:4; Mal. 3:23. This fire must never be allowed to go out. John 14:16. So we are commanded not to quench the Holy Spirit, but should keep it burning, with the fat of our sin-offerings and our whole burnt-offerings.

3. In these different sacrifices we get so many different aspects of Christ's one sacrifice. All the sacrifices stood for the one who offered them. Christ gave Himself for us. Christ is our burnt-offering: we bring Him to God, and He accepts Him as a whole burnt-offering for us, and counts us just as worthy as the offering we bring. John 17:23.

4. There was no life taken nor any blood shed in this offering, hence it did not represent Christ in His death, but Christ in His life. Rom. 5:10. In the meat or food-offering we have a shadow of the perfect Man.

5. This offering was either baked, boiled, or fried in oil, showing how fully the Holy Spirit entered into the life and work of Christ (Heb. 9:14), and must not be separated from ours.

6. The salt represented the saving qualities of the righteousness of Christ. By using salt in their sacrifices the people were bound to Jehovah in a most solemn covenant. When the Arabs make a covenant together they put salt on the blade of a sword, and every one puts a little in his mouth. This constitutes them blood relations, and they remain faithful to each other, even when life is in danger.
