## Notes

1. The leper was brought by some one to the priest, so we are to bring sinners to Christ. Christ suffered outside of Jerusalem, that He might save the world, so we are to go outside the church to bring sinners to Him, who sees them when they are "yet a great way off" and runs to meet them.

2. The blood being touched upon the right ear would indicate that our hearing should be consecrated to God. We must know no voice but His. John 10:4, 5. It being put upon the thumb and toe would indicate that the service of our hands and feet must be only for Him. Ps. 119:101. The oil was placed upon the blood. Wherever there is cleansing and consecration there is also the presence of the Holy Spirit. Notice that the same offerings and consecration were required of the leper that God required of the high priest. Exodus 29. So the humblest child of God must be as devoted and consecrated as was Christ. John 17:19.
