## Notes

1. There must be a sin-offering and a burnt-offering before there could be a peace-offering. So now a man must first come to God as a sinner, to have his sin put away. He must come to God as a worshiper, laying all upon the altar, to be accepted in Christ, and must feed upon Christ as the food-offering. The result of this will be peace.

2. Notice that the sin-offering was given to the officiating priests alone. Lev. 6:26; 7:7. No one is to share our sin but Christ. The burnt-offering was wholly the Lord's. Lev. 1:9. Our consecration must be to God alone. The meat-offering was given to God-to Aaron and his sons (Lev. 2:9, 10) â€” which was, to represent God and the church feeding on Christ. The peace-offering was extended to all, the Lord, the priests and their families, the offerer and his whole household, with his friends and the Levite, thus showing that the Lord desires us to offer His peace to all, as announced by the angels at the birth of Christ. "Peace on earth, good will toward men." "And preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh." Eph. 2:16, 17.

3. The Lord does not ask any of us to live on past mercies and blessings. He "daily loadeth us with benefits." His mercies "are new every morning." Hence we should make fresh thanksgiving-offerings every day.
