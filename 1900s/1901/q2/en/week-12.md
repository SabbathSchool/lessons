## Notes

1. The yoke represents the yoke of bondage and sin. Christ never came under this yoke. 2 Peter 2:22. He who was above the law, being the Author of the law, voluntarily became sin for us, suffering the penalty of the broken law in our stead. Yet, never having committed sin, He never came under the yoke of bondage. His submission was wholly voluntary.

2. This was called the water of separation, because when sprinkled upon a defiled person it separated him from his uncleanness, and admitted him to all the privileges which he for a time had lost. Num. 5:2. The ashes point to the suffering and death of Christ; the Holy Spirit uses the word (symbolized by the running water) to remind us of that suffering. Ps. 19:7, margin.
