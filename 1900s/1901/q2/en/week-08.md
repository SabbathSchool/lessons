## Note

"Day and night the holy incense diffused its fragrance throughout the sacred apartments, and without far around the tabernacle." "The incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the merits and intercession of Christ." "In the offering of incense the priest was brought more directly into the presence of God than in any other act of daily ministration." â€” Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 348, 353. So in prayer we are brought nearer to God than in any other act of worship.
