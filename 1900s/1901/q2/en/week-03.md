## Notes

1. Just at the time when men could endure Christ no longer, and took counsel together and put Him to death, declaring they had no king but Caesar, God, by the power of the resurrection, declares Him to be His Son and His King, and places Him at His own right hand, giving Him all power and dominion. And for what purpose? "Having collected the riches of the universe, and laid open the resources of infinite power, He gives them all into the hands of Christ, and says, All these are for man. Use these gifts to convince him that there is no greater love than Mine in earth or heaven. His greatest happiness will be found in loving Me." — Desire of Ages, p. 57.

2. "God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried this same into the highest heaven. It is the Son of man who shares the throne of the universe... Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of infinite love." — Desire of Ages, p. 25.

3. If we belong to Christ, our foes and Christ's foes are the same. They are the sins of our own heart.

4. While we cling to our sins, He cannot put them under His feet without putting us there with them, and so He waits for us to give them over into His hands. We are to sit where He sits, and in quietness and confidence give over all our enemies into His hands, and we have the promise that the God of peace shall "bruise Satan under your feet shortly."
