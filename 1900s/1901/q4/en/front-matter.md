### FOURTH QUARTER 1901

**NOTE**—In the preparation of these lessons all Scripture references, and the pages of "Christ's Object Lessons," should be thoroughly studied first, then the questions. The questions are not the lessons. They are only for the purpose of finding out what we have observed while studying.

More of the preciousness of these lessons will be obtained if the lesson is studied each day throughout the week. In the parables of Jesus there is salvation from sin for every type of sinner—from the Pharisee to the prodigal.

The notes are wholly selected from such portions of "Christ's Object Lessons" as apply to each lesson.
