# Miracles and Delusions
**By A. O. TAIT**

## An Excellent Work

A powerful array of scriptural predictions regarding latter-day delusions, counterfeits, spirit manifestations, etc., with a faithful presentation of God's messages of warning regarding the same.

The search-light of truth is used to reveal many dangerous popular errors.

Will be thoroughly appreciated by truth-seekers everywhere. It will not arouse antagonism, as it appeals strongly to reason and presents evident truth, and attacks principles, not parties.

A clear-cut presentation of the principles of true "Christian science," or the science of Christianity.

# THREE NEW TRACTS

| Title | Catalog Number | Description | Price |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **The Fulness of Jew and Gentile** | Bible Students' Library No. 165 | A treatise showing that Israel's claim to the heirship of the covenant with Abraham was forfeited in her rejection of Christ, and that all who accept Christ thereby become "Israelites indeed." | **One-half Cent Each; 34 Cents per Hundred** |
| **The United States as a Christian Nation** | Apples of Gold Library No. 71 | Discusses the many claims recently made that this is a Christian nation, showing clearly that it is impossible for any nation, as such, to be Christian. An excellent publication to circulate in districts where there is a tendency to legislate on religious matters. | **One-half Cent Each; 34 Cents per Hundred** |
| **The Relation of the Law to the Gospel** | Bible Students' Library No. 166 | A most valuable leaflet discussing the relation of the laws, rites and ceremonies of the old dispensation with the work of Christ and the Christian church, showing that they are inseparable. "The Law is Christ designed; the Gospel is Christ enshrined." (A reprint of a paper read at the Jewish Christian Convention held in Boston, May 21-24, at which Dr. Arthur T. Pierson was chairman). | **24 Pages; 1½ Cents each; $1.10 per hundred** |
