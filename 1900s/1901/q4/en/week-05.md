4. Does the fact that "the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself" show that it is within God's aid, or without man's knowledge and help?
5. In the process of growth, what first appears? What next? What last of all?
6. How soon after this state of things arrives, is the grain reaped? Verse 29, margin. Why?
7. Before sowing garden seeds, what must be done with the soil? Why do men not plant while the ground is frozen?
8. What is God's part in the preparation of the earth-soil? What is man's?
9. Beyond what point can man do nothing?
10. How is the soil of the heart made ready for the gospel seed? John 1:4, 9; Ps. 65:9; Isa. 44:3; Hosea 10:12; Phil. 2:13; Matt. 5:14, 16; 1 Peter 2:1, 2; Matt. 5:6.

## NOTES

The parable of the seed reveals that God is at work in nature. The seed has in itself a germinating principle, a principle that God Himself has planted: yet if left to itself, the seed would have no power to spring up. Man has his part to act in promoting the growth of grain. He must prepare and enrich the soil and cast in the seed. He must till the fields. But there is a point beyond which he can accomplish nothing.

There is life in the seed, there is power in the soil; but unless an infinite power is exercised day and night, the seed will yield no returns. . . . The life which the Creator has implanted, He alone can call forth. Every seed grows, every plant develops, by the power of God.

As the earth bringeth forth her bud, as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth.

The germination of the seed represents the beginning of the spiritual life, and the development of the plant is a beautiful figure of Christian growth. As in nature, so in grace; there can be no life without growth. The plant must either grow or die.

At every stage of development our life may be perfect; yet if God's purpose for us is fulfilled, there will be continual advancement. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime.

There can be no growth or fruitfulness in the life that is centered in self.

Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own.

Were all who profess His name bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed of the gospel. Quickly the last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ would come to gather the precious grain.
