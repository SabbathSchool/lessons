## NOTES

The Jews looked for the kingdom of God to be established in the same way as the kingdoms of the world. To promote righteousness they resorted to external measures. They devised methods and plans. But Christ implants a principle. By implanting truth and righteousness He counterworks error and sin.

Not only is the growth of Christ's kingdom illustrated by the parable of the mustard seed, but in every stage of its growth the experience represented in the parable is repeated.

At the outset its advocates are few. By the great men of the world, and by a world-conforming church, they are opposed and despised.

In this last generation the parable of the mustard seed is to reach a signal and triumphant fulfillment. The little seed will become a tree.

Every seed that sends up its green blade to the sunlight declares the wonder-working power of that word uttered by Him who "spake and it was;" who "commanded, and it stood fast."

In everything that tends to the sustenance of man is seen the concurrence of divine and human effort. There can be no reaping unless the human hand acts its part in the sowing of the seed.
