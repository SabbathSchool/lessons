1. What is said of a sower? Where did he go? For what purpose? Where did some of the seed fall? What became of it? Other seed fell where? How soon did this grow? Why? What effect had the sun upon this? Why did it wither?
2. What are we asked to hear? Matt. 13:18.
3. In this verse, what corresponds to the fowls by the wayside? Away from whom does he catch the seed?

7. Has Satan any assistants in this work? Matt. 12:30; see note.
8. Who receives the seed into stony places? How does such a one receive the word? What is the meaning of "anon"?
9. What is lacking? How does he become offended? What is understood by the word "offended" in this connection?
10. Does an immediate acceptance of the word when it is presented, necessarily prove one to be a stony-ground hearer? Matt. 4:18-22, etc.; see also note.
11. Does the fact that one is in the condition of the wayside hearer, or that of the stony-ground hearer, show that there is no hope for him? Heb. 7:25; Isa. 55:7.

## NOTES

Satan has many helpers. Many who profess to be Christians are aiding the tempter to catch away the seeds of truth from other hearts. Many who listen to the preaching of the word of God make it the subject of criticism at home. They sit in judgment on the sermon as they would on the words of a lecturer or a political speaker.

It is not because men receive the word immediately, nor because they rejoice in it, that they fall away. As soon as Matthew heard the Saviour's call, immediately he rose up, left all, and followed Him. As soon as the divine word comes to our hearts, God desires us to receive it; and it is right to accept it with joy. "Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth."
