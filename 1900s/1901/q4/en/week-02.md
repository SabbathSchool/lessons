## NOTES

They expected the Messiah to prove His claims by mighty deeds of conquest, to establish His empire on the ruins of earthly kingdoms. This expectation Christ answered in the parable of the sower. Not by force of arms, not by violent interpositions, was the kingdom of God to prevail, but by the implanting of a new principle in the hearts of men.

The word of God is the seed. Every seed has, in itself, a germinating principle. In it the life of the plant is enfolded. So there is life in God's word. . . . In every command and in every promise of the word of God is the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be fulfilled and the promise realized. He who, by faith, received the word, is receiving the very life and character of God.

But the teacher of sacred truth can impart only that which he himself knows by experience. "The sower sowed his seed."
