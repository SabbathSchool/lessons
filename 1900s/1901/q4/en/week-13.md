## NOTES

In the parable of the prodigal son is presented the Lord's dealing with those who have once known the Father's love, but have allowed the tempter to lead them captive at his will.

Whatever the appearance may be, every life centered in self is squandered.

The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen to separate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to bring him back to the Father's house.

The prodigal son in his wretchedness "came to himself."

In his restless youth the prodigal looked upon his father as stern and severe. How different his conception of him now! So those who are deceived by Satan look upon God as hard and exacting.

In the parable there is no taunting, no casting up to the prodigal of his evil course; the son feels that the past is forgiven and forgotten, blotted out forever.

Self-righteousness not only leads men to misrepresent God, but makes them cold-hearted and critical toward their brethren. . . . While the soul is making its very first struggles against the flood of temptations, they stand by, stubborn, self-willed, complaining, accusing. They may claim to be children of God, but they are acting out the spirit of Satan. By their attitude toward their brethren these accusers place themselves where God can not give them the light of His countenance.
