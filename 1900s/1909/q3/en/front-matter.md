## Lessons on the Life of Christ

For Senior Division

Third Quarter, 1909
July to September

Published by

The present series of lessons on the "Life of Christ" will continue in all the divisions until the end of 1910.

The German Little Friend has a circulation of over 25,000 copies.

We have eight mission schools in the interior of Africa with a membership of 387. These schools donated in one quarter, $26.06. It is an inspiration to think of these black people in Central Africa, who themselves are living in one of the darkest and most needy mission fields of the world, giving from their poverty to carry the light to others.

As an indication of the growth of the Sabbath-school work in foreign fields the senior lessons are printed in the following languages, the figures show the number printed:

German, 10,000; Dutch, 350; Russian, 950; Esthonian, 300; Lettonian, 350; Polish, 200; Rumanian, 150; Hungarian, 250; Bohemian, 150; and Spanish. Translations are also made in a number of other languages, but the number required being so limited they are not issued in printed form.

"Desire of Ages" is an excellent help in a study of the lessons on the Life of Christ. Every family should procure a copy and study it.

The latest reports give the number of Sabbath-schools in the world as 3,747. Of these, 1,269 are outside the United States and Canada. The total membership is 88,843. Of this number, 4,463 are Home Department members.

During the year 1908, the Sabbath-schools contributed $84,365.65 to advance the work in mission fields.
