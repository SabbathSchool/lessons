## Notes

1. The direction of the eye shows the purpose of the man as does the laying up of treasures the affections of the heart. He who has a single purpose to do God's will, who steadfastly looks to God, will be guided and filled with the light of God. He whose purpose is turned upon the low, dark ambition of selfishness, worldliness and sin will become a body of darkness. And if he who has known the light, turns to the darkness, how great is that darkness.

2. The injunction is not an excuse of laziness, shiftlessness, thoughtlessness. "Take no anxious thought," is the better expression. God demands prudence, industry, care in His service, but having done our duty in His fear and by His grace, do not worry. Leave results to Him.

3. Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith.
"What paineth thee
In others in thyself may be;
All dust is frail, all flesh is weak,
Be thou the true man thou dost seek."

We may join Christ's condemnation of sin; but with Him we should love the sinner, and endeavor to save him from sin. Never is it for us to count a soul irretrievably lost; that Christ can save him has been demonstrated in that He has saved us.
