## Notes

1. The disciples of Jesus truly believed on Him, but their faith had not gone beyond His personal presence, beyond the aid of the natural senses. The centurion comprehended to some extent the great and perfect government of God. Even as in the Roman system, he, the centurion, could send soldiers to execute his commands, so Jesus had control of power and agents far beyond ordinary men. Jesus could say, "Go," and His servant would go. The Roman recognized the great unseen working of God. And Jesus "sent His word and healed" the child, as Matthew intimates. We may not see the physical form of Jesus, but He is just as able to cleanse and help and heal to-day as He then was when visible.

2. Jesus showed before John's messengers what He had previously declared. John 5:36. God's word, John's testimony, and the work of our Lord all agreed, and constituted the strongest kind of evidence. Note the tender appeal in the assurance of verse 23, sent to the prophet in prison.

3. John was a type of the last-day messengers of God. Those who know God's message to-day will not be reeds shaken in the wind, "carried about with every wind of doctrine." They will not be concerned about wearing soft raiment, nor will they live luxuriously. They will be content to be voices of God, crying in the wilderness of sin. John 1:23.

4. John's message, as every other great message of God, developed two classes, the believers and the unbelievers. The believers were obedient and were baptized. The unbelievers were God's enemies and their own. The believers, in the great judgment-day, will reveal by their presence in the kingdom of God that John's message was sufficient to save, and God was justified in its giving. So will it be with God's last message.

5. What a picture of the present generation is that which Jesus draws of that generation. How uncertain is religious belief! How men criticize every good! But there will be some who will fear and serve the Lord. These are the truly wise. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."

6. Let us not dwell on the physical details of the parable. Let us not discuss the question as to whether the woman was Mary, the sister of Lazarus, and the occurrence the same as that recorded in John 12:1-8. There are arguments on both sides; let that phase of the matter stand as it is. Note the tender mercy of God in His message to the woman and to us also.
