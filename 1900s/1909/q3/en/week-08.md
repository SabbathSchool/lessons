## Notes

1. "Ask," "seek," "knock." Be in earnest. Many pause on the very threshold of blessing and deliverance.

2. Luke, instead of saying that the Lord will give us good things, says He will give His Holy Spirit, which brings all other blessings in its train. The Lord is more willing to give that fulness of all blessings than is an earthly parent to give the needed food to a hungry child. But we must yield all to receive the blessing. Then the love of God will be shed abroad in our hearts. Rom. 5:5.

3. The thought is not what we would like to do to others, but what we would have others do to us if our circumstances and conditions were reversed. "Put yourself in his place," is the motto. There would never be religious persecution, nor harsh, cruel judgment if men would follow this rule. In it is summed up all the teaching of God regarding our duty to our fellow men.

4. "Strait" is used in the sense of narrow in both verses. The gate does not let the pilgrim in laden with selfishness, worldliness, riches, sin. All these must be left without. As long as we cling to them we have not entered the narrow gate, whatever we may profess to the contrary.

5. "I never knew you." Awful words will they be in the final judgment. Jesus Christ is not the minister of sin. He came to save from sin, not in sin. He died to "redeem us from all iniquity—lawlessness, law-breaking; and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Titus 2:14. It can not be too strongly emphasized that faith in Christ leads to sin-cleansing, clean living, and righteous doing.

6. "Having authority." The scribes built their teachings on the traditions of men. Jesus came with a mission, a message, to save men; and the words He spoke were spirit and life. As the Father sent Him, so He has sent others. If we are His heralds, we have His message, and in that message is authority and power. He would not have His servants frightened from the positiveness of the message by the cry of "dogmatic," or the insolence of tradition, or the sneer of "learned" philosophical critics. "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine."
