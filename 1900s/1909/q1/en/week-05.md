### Notes

1. The passage in Phil. 1:22, 23 is parallel to 2 Cor. 5:1-4, in which three different conditions are brought to view, by the expressions, "in this tabernacle," "unclothed," and "clothed upon." There can be no question but that being "in this tabernacle" signifies our present life, when we, as Paul says in Phil. 1:24, "abide in the flesh." Compare 2 Peter 1:13, 14. The condition of being "clothed upon" is the state wherein mortality is "swallowed up of life"; and that is at the coming of the Lord and the resurrection, when this mortal puts on immortality, and death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Cor. 15:51-54. When we put on immortality, we are "clothed upon with our house which is from heaven," which is eternal. Consequently, the "unclothed" state must be the time between the putting off of "this tabernacle" (compare 2 Peter 1:14) and the putting on of the house from heaven. In other words, it is the state of death. But the apostle says that while we groan to be released from the burden of "this tabernacle,"— this infirm flesh, — we do not groan to be "unclothed," that is, to die, but rather to be "clothed upon." That is, the object of the Christian's longing is not death, but the coming of Christ. And since, also, none can be with Christ except at His coming, it is evident that when Paul said that he had a desire to depart and be with Christ, he did not long for death, but for the time of the resurrection of the dead and the translation of the living.

2. The word "conversation," in every place where it occurs in the Bible, has either an entirely different, or else a far wider signification than the one now commonly given to it. In Ps. 37:14; 50:23 it means "way," as the margin indicates, and as the Revised Version has it. In Gal. 1:13 it is evident that the word means Paul's whole course of life as a Jew. In Eph. 2:3; 4:22 it also means "manner of life." This is the most common meaning of the word. The Greek word from which it is translated is the same that is rendered "behave" in 1 Tim. 3:15. In Phil. 3:20 the word "conversation" means "citizenship." We are to be strangers and pilgrims on this earth, having our citizenship in heaven, whence we look for the Lord Jesus. In Phil. 1:27 the American Revised Version has "manner of life," and the margin gives the reading, "behave as citizens, worthily." The idea is the same, and is in harmony with the statement in Phil. 3:20. Our citizenship being in heaven, our continuing city is there, and there our names are entered on the great register. Therefore, our manner of life should be such as becomes those who say that they seek such a country. In other words, we should live as citizens of heaven. This present world is not the Christian's country. Heb. 13:14.
