# Sabbath School Lessons on the Epistle to the Philippians

## GENERAL

A careful reading of the whole epistle to the Philippians should precede the study of these lessons. Read it as you would a letter from a friend. Meditate prayerfully upon it as you read. Study the circumstances under which it was written, and the special instruction which it was intended to convey.
