### Note

When Paul wrote the epistle to the Philippians, he was in prison, awaiting his trial. Epaphroditus had come from Philippi with assistance for him, and while waiting on him was taken sick. Paul's anxiety was not for himself, but for the brethren in Philippi, not only for their spiritual welfare, but because of their anxiety about Epaphroditus. So he sent him back, although he really needed his help, and designed, moreover, to send Timothy. But he did not yet know how it would go with him at his trial. He might be put to death, he might have a little respite, or he might be set at liberty. As soon as he should find out how his case would turn, he would send Timothy, thus parting from his dearest friend and helper.
