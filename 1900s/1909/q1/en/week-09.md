### Notes

1. The word "dog" is used in the Bible as a term of reproach, to signify a shameless, corrupt person. See Rev. 22:15.

2. From the matter-of-course way in which the apostle goes on to explain what the concision is, as contrasted with that which is only outward, we conclude that by the word "concision" he means "circumcision." This was a term used synonymously with Jews, but is here used with special reference to those Jews who trusted in circumcision as the means of justification. These were classed with dogs and evil workers, as equally dangerous, for they would turn all who listened to them away from the simplicity of the gospel, a proceeding classed with the beguiling of Eve by the serpent. 2 Cor. 11:3, 4.

3. "Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless." Besides his birth and his orthodox training, the two points above mentioned were perhaps the things upon which Saul, the Pharisee, depended most for salvation. Believing that the traditions of the fathers were the commands of God, he was "more exceedingly zealous" for them than any other man in the nation. Therefore the more he persecuted those who opposed traditions, the more favor he thought he was finding with God. Then, too, he was a Pharisee of the strictest sect. That is, he was most punctilious in the outward observance of the law. But when he saw the righteousness of the law as it is in Christ, he acknowledged that all the self-righteousness upon which he had been building his hopes of salvation was so far short of perfection that it was sufficient to condemn him; and he gladly counted it worse than useless, that he might receive the free gift of Christ's perfect righteousness.
