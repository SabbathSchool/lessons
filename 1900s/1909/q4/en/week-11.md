## Notes.

1. It was because the disciples were at strife among themselves as to who should be greatest, that the real truth concerning the events to transpire at Jerusalem was hidden from them. They might have known, but they still held to the Jewish idea that the Messiah must establish a temporal kingdom at Jerusalem. They were so busy with anticipation as to their own future place of authority in the new administration of affairs, that they had no desire for the unwelcome truth Jesus began to unfold to them regarding His sufferings and death.

2. "Peter saw in the collector's question an insinuation touching Christ's loyalty to the temple. Zealous for his Master's honor, he hastily answered, without consulting Him, that Jesus would pay the tribute. But Peter only partially comprehended the purpose of his questioner. There were some classes who were held to be exempt from the payment of the tribute. . . . In the days of Christ the priests and Levites were still regarded as especially devoted to the temple, and were not required to make the annual contribution for its support. Prophets also were exempted from this payment. In requiring the tribute for Jesus, the rabbis were setting aside His claim as a prophet or teacher, and were dealing with Him as with any commonplace person. A refusal on His part to pay the tribute would be represented as disloyalty to the temple; while, on the other hand, the payment of it would be taken as justifying their rejection of Him as a prophet. Only a little before, Peter had acknowledged Jesus as the Son of God; but he now missed an opportunity of setting forth the character of his Master. By his answer to the collector, that Jesus would pay the tribute, he had virtually sanctioned the false conception of Him to which the priests and rulers were trying to give currency."—"Desire of Ages," page 433.

This tribute money should not be confounded with the Roman taxes. It was levied by the Jewish rulers upon their own people for the support of the temple and its service. For instruction to Christians regarding the support of civil powers, see Rom. 13:1-6.

3. "If Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest, He would virtually have acknowledged the justice of the claim, and would thus have denied His divinity. But while He saw good to meet the demand, He denied the claim upon which it was based. In providing for the payment of the tribute He gave evidence of His divine character. It was made manifest that He was one with God, and therefore was not under tribute as a mere subject of the kingdom."—"Desire of Ages," page 434.

4. Self-seeking, born of selfishness, is sure to cause offense. Christ's example condemns this spirit in all His followers. "In honor preferring one another," is the standard for the Christian believer. "Lucifer had said, 'I will be like the Most High;' and the desire for self-exaltation had brought strife into the heavenly courts, and had banished a multitude of the hosts of God. Had Lucifer really desired to be like the Most High, he would never have deserted his appointed place in heaven; for the Spirit of the Most High is manifested in unselfish ministry. Lucifer desired God's power, but not His character. He sought for himself the highest place [the very thing the disciples at this time were doing], and every being who is actuated by his spirit will do the same. Thus alienation, discord, and strife will be inevitable."—"Desire of Ages," page 435, 436.

5. "Men often part with some member of the body, at the discretion of a surgeon, that they may preserve the trunk, and die a little later; and yet they will not deprive themselves of a look, a touch, a small pleasure, which endanger the eternal death of the soul." "We must shut our senses against dangerous objects to avoid the occasions of sin, and deprive ourselves of all that is most dear and profitable to us, in order to save our souls, when we find that these dear and profitable things, however innocent in themselves, cause us to sin against God, or lead our hearts away from Him."— Dr. Adam Clarke.
