## Notes.

1. Daily the servant of the Lord should be studying the great themes of the Gospel, and filling the mind with the mighty truths of God's word. Then when asked for a reason of his faith, whether before judges or councils, or whether in trial by the adversary of our souls, the Holy Spirit will bring to the mind the very promises of the Word that are needed. To bring to our remembrance the words of the Lord is the work of the Holy Spirit. John 14:26.

2. The martyrs have not all been burned at the stake nor have they all died in dungeons. Some are in homes suffering for the truth's sake. As a result of obeying God and walking in the light, wives have borne persecution from husbands, and husbands from wives, and parents from children. To stand true to God under such circumstances takes a martyr's spirit and a heart made strong by the love of God. Though the Gospel is a Gospel of peace to those who receive it, its rejection often causes suffering and sorrow. But the Lord admonishes His people under all circumstances to stand without wavering. Those who as good soldiers endure to the end will be saved.

3. God's greatness is seen in His care for the most minute objects of His creation as well as in making and upholding worlds. Not a sparrow is uncared for by Him. If one falls, He sees it. Even the hairs of our head are numbered! This reveals a most wonderful and intimate knowledge of God concerning us. Small comfort this for hypocrites and lukewarm professors; but for the trusting child of God it brings peace, and banishes from the heart all needless anxiety and worry. "Casting all your care upon Him, for He careth for you." 1 Peter 5:7.

4. To save man Jesus gave up all. Phil. 2:5-8. To follow Jesus we also must give up all. "In this way, then, every one from among you who is not bidding adieu to all his own goods can not be My disciples." Luke 14:33.— Rotherham's Translation.
