## Notes.

1. Jesus no doubt saw that this offer to follow Him was prompted by a desire for personal gain. In placing before him His own poverty and sacrifice to save man, He revealed the life of toil and sacrifice of all who truly follow Him.

2. This does not seem to be a request simply to attend the funeral of a father, then dead. The father might live for years. But when the father dies, and the estate is divided, and all temporal matters fixed up, then the son will follow the command to go and preach the Gospel. All this, and more, seems to be implied in this answer. Temporal things first; spiritual things secondary. Many today are making the same mistake.

3. Worse than Sodom! And why? Simply because they rejected the message of light and salvation sent to them. No more forceful statement could be made of the terrible consequences of failing to receive the Gospel and to walk in the light.

4. While the people of these cities were generally impenitent, yet, three of the disciples—Philip, Andrew, and Peter — came from Bethsaida, upon which a woe is here pronounced. John 1:44. "More tolerable." If we are lost, our condemnation in the Judgment and final punishment will depend upon the amount of light we have rejected.

5. How many there are, who, like the lepers, receive blessings continually from the hand of the Lord, and yet fail to return and give thanks to Him. Israel of old "forgot God which had done great things in Egypt." Instead they "murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord."

"If we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that we know we have,— the great mercy and love of God,— we should have more faith and greater joy. No tongue can express, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating the goodness and love of God."—"Ministry of Healing," pages 252, 253.
