## Recommendations on Sabbath-School Work Passed by the General Conference, May 13 to June 6, 1909.

1. Whereas, The Sabbath School Worker is a molding factor in our Sabbath-schools, and it is the medium whereby Sabbath-school laborers are kept in touch with progressive methods; therefore,

We Recommend, That earnest efforts be made to place this journal in the hands of every officer and teacher in our Sabbath-schools.

## Sabbath-School Home Department.

2. Whereas, The Home Department of the Sabbath-school has been established to meet the needs of our people who are isolated from those of like precious faith, as well as those whom circumstances prevent from attending the local school; therefore,

We Recommend:

(a) That the conference workers be urged to cooperate with our secretaries by strengthening this work by securing the names and addresses of all isolated Sabbath-keepers within their territory, that they may be brought in touch with the progress of the message.

(b) That we urge the carrying forward of this work more fully in our local schools, thus bringing the vitalizing power of the Sabbath-school lessons to the whole denomination.

## Sabbath-School Offerings to Missions

3. Whereas, Our Sabbath-schools need the blessed inspiration of a real burden for mission fields, while opportunities to spread the message in foreign lands are multiplying faster than their means; therefore,

We Recommend, That our Sabbath-schools give all their donations to missions, providing for their expenses in some other way; and, further,

We Recommend, That each conference pay the entire expenses of the Sabbath-school departmental work without drawing upon the Sabbath-school offerings given by the schools for missions.

Four Sabbath-schools were held during the General Conference. The largest attendance was 1,840. The total amount of gifts to missions was $597.06.
