# Lesson 10 — The Transfiguration; Healing of a Demoniac

December 4, 1909

## Lesson Scripture: Mark 9:1-29.
## Parallel Scriptures: Matt. 16:28 to 17:21; Luke 9:27-45.
## Lesson Helps: "Desire of Ages," chapters 46, 47; "Spirit of Prophecy," Vol 2, chapter 28; Sabbath School Worker.

## Place: Probably Mt. Hermon. "The reasons for believing that some part of Hermon was the scene of the transfiguration are: (1) Jesus and His disciples were in this vicinity within a week of the transfiguration. (2) Mark 9:30 represents Jesus as passing through Galilee after the scene on the mount, as if He had been within its limits; while Tabor, the only other site suggested, is within Galilee. (3) It was a high mountain, more than four times as high as Tabor. (4) It was well suited for the scene by its height, seclusion, and snowy splendor. (5) There is no authority in the tradition which favors Mt. Tabor. (6) Tabor had a Roman fortification and town upon its top in the time of Christ."— Peloubet.

## Persons: Jesus, Moses, Elias, the disciples; the father and the afflicted son; the scribes.

## Notes.

1. This statement of Jesus that some of those present should not taste of death until they saw the kingdom of God come, no doubt referred to the Transfiguration. Here was given a representation in miniature of the future kingdom and home of God's people. Jesus, the King, was seen in His glory, Moses stood as a representative of the resurrected saints (Jude 9), and Elijah of those who will be translated at the coming of Christ. 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

2. "The cares and troubles of his [Peter's] wandering life, and all his gloomy forebodings for his Master and himself, had faded away before such brightness and joy, and, in his fond, childlike simplicity, he dreamed of lengthening out the delight."— Geikie.

Jesus does not desire that His people shall live in solitude like monks. He desires that they mingle with the world lost in sin, and carry to the people the glad news of salvation.

3. "Questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean." Had the disciples not been filled with their own false notions, they would have believed the words of Jesus, and His meaning would have been clear. This explains why many fail to understand the scripture.

4. "The words of Christ pointing to His death, had brought sadness and doubt. And the selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. Instead of strengthening their faith by prayer and meditation on the words of Christ, they had been dwelling upon their discouragements and personal grievances. In this state of darkness they had undertaken the conflict with Satan."—"Desire of Ages," page 430.

5. The Revised Version reads, "And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth." Rotherham's Translation reads, "And Jesus said to him, As for this, 'if it be possible to thee,' Why! all things are possible to him who has faith."

"If thou canst." Jesus repeated the words of the father in gentle rebuke for his unbelief, and then encouraged him to believe.

6. Note the words, "Enter no more into him." Jesus does not intend that our victories over Satan shall be only temporary.

7. "This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting." It requires a special struggle to overcome some of our besetting sins. But when we become sufficiently earnest in the work of gaining the victory over our shortcomings that we will with continued prayer and fasting seek the Lord for victory, we shall obtain it.
