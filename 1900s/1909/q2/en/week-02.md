## Notes

1. The Gospel of Luke was written by an educated man, a physician, a companion of Paul. See Col. 4:11, 14; Acts 16:10-17 (as Luke, being the writer of the book of Acts, uses the pronoun "we," it is evident he was a companion of Paul); 2 Tim. 4:11. It was written with the Gentiles in view, presenting Christ as the Saviour of men of every nation. Luke makes especially prominent the human nature of Jesus, and speaks much of His healing power. He gives not less than twenty-three parables, miracles, and incidents not mentioned by the other Gospel writers. His Gospel was probably written about A.D. 63. The fact that Luke had studied the events of Christ's life does not in any way lessen the inspiration of his narrative.

2. The subject studied in our last lesson is here told in detail. While we can not explain the mystery of the incarnation, yet this amazing sacrifice is a demonstration to every trembling soul of the love of God for sinners, and an assurance that all who will may be delivered from the bondage of sin, and receive as a gift the precious boon of eternal life.

3. Note (1) Mary's song is not an exaltation of self, but of God, her Saviour; (2) Jesus regards the lowly; (3) It was the mighty One who wrought, who is holy, merciful, and strong to put down evil and save the good, and who remembers Israel and His covenant to Abraham.
