## Notes

1. "To fulfil all righteousness." Jesus was God acting in sinful flesh on behalf of the sinner. He made Himself one with humanity. He took upon Himself the woes, the needs, and sins, of humanity, so that He felt the consciousness and keenness of it as no other soul ever felt it. He was baptized for humanity. In all that He did He was fulfilling righteousness for humanity.

2. The word "baptize" is taken directly into English from the Greek, and means "plunge," "immerse," "whelm." If the water had been sprinkled or poured upon the Lord, He need not have gone down into the water, as He must have done to have come up out of the water.

3. The voice from heaven was the voice of the Father. It was God's encouragement to His Son to help meet the temptation and agony that awaited Him in the wilderness. Every soul clothed in the righteousness of Jesus may take home to his heart the same words of comfort and encouragement.

4. "There came to the Saviour, as if in answer to His prayers, one in the guise of an angel from heaven. He claimed to have a commission from God to declare that Christ's fast was at an end." — "Desire of Ages," page 118.

5. Satan is "the god of this world." 2 Cor. 4:4. When man yielded himself to temptation in Eden, he yielded his dominion over the earth given him by the Creator. Satan holds this dominion, in fact, but not by right, for man had no authority to yield that which he held in trust from God. Jesus came to win back the lost possession by giving His life to meet the penalty of sin. The devil offered what seemed an easier way. Only worship me, and all shall be Thine. The Master, however, did not yield him homage. Yet many of His professed followers have done so, and through yielding, have themselves become subjects of Satan.

6. We have here one of the best meanings of worship; namely, service. To serve is the highest kind of worship.

7. It is worthy of note that one of the books of the Bible which has been assailed by the "higher critics" was the armory from which our Lord drew all His mighty weapons in this contest with Satan. These three temptations were representative; appetite and the flesh, presumption, and the love of power.
