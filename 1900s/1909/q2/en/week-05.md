## Notes

1. "Wise men," or better, "Magi." The word is Persian or Median. They were from a priestly caste, who doubtless had received light from the Holy Scriptures, through the influence of Daniel and otherwise.

"As these magi studied the starry heavens, and sought to fathom the mystery hidden in their bright paths, they beheld the glory of the Creator. Seeking clearer knowledge, they turned to the Hebrew Scriptures. In their own land were treasured prophetic writings that predicted the coming of a divine teacher. Balaam belonged to the magicians, though at one time a prophet of God; by the Holy Spirit he had foretold the prosperity of Israel and the appearing of the Messiah; and his prophecies had been handed down by tradition from century to century. But in the Old Testament the Saviour's advent was more clearly revealed. The magi learned with joy that His coming was near, and that the whole world was to be filled with a knowledge of the glory of the Lord." — "Desire of Ages," pages 60, 61.

2. "That star was a distant company of shining angels." — "Desire of Ages," page 60.

"Strange occupants were in that stable. The wise and proud were there kneeling. Angels had been there adoring. The Son of God was there sleeping in a human mother's arms. The stable was greater than the palace of a king, for its manger cradled the 'King of Kings, Emmanuel, the Wonderful, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Redeemer, Saviour of men,' who were all embraced in that helpless infant. There it lay, calm and fair, and lovely, the companion of cattle, and yet the Maker of the earth and the adored of heaven — the son of a carpenter, and the 'Son of God.' ... The priests of Aaron had stood before the altar and struggled for ages with the mighty problem, and lo! the 'Star of Bethlehem' pointed to that Babe as its solution. The long wanderings of the Hebrews, the miracles that preserved them, the imposing ceremonies of their religion, the 'ark of God,' the 'mercy-seat,' the pomp of temple worship, what did they all mean? That silent star pointed to the reply. Altars and sacrifices, prayers and prophecies, all were to end here. For four thousand years the earth had been rolling on its axis to bring about one event, and lo! it was accomplished." — Headley, in "Golden Sheaves," page 515.

3. Archelaus was the son of Herod the Great by a Samaritan woman named Malthace. On complaint before the emperor of his tyranny, he was dethroned, and exiled to Gaul where he died.
