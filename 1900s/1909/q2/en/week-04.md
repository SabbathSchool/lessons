## Notes

1. The message of the angel was a consummation of the long-deferred hope of the ages. Seers and prophets had predicted it. With longing eyes and aching hearts God's people from dungeon and exile and captivity had looked for that hour. The Redeemer of the lost race was born into the world. Truly this was good tidings; why should not hearts be glad?

2. Anna — "An aged widow, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She had married early, but after seven years her husband died, and during her long widowhood she daily attended the morning and evening services of the temple. Anna was eighty-four years old when the infant Jesus was brought to the temple by His mother, and entering as Simeon pronounced his thanksgiving, she also broke forth in praise." — "Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia."

3. All of God's children could have known of the coming of Jesus as well as Simeon and Anna. The prophecies concerning His coming might have been understood by all, but sin and unbelief had blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts. It will be the same at the second advent of the Saviour. A few will be waiting for Him like Simeon of old, but the wicked will pass on and be punished. "Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand." Dan. 12:10.
