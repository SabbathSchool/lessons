## LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 1:1-18

## RELATED SCRIPTURES: Gen. 1:26; Isa. 63:9; Micah 5:2; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16

## LESSON HELPS: "Desire of Ages," chapters 1 to 3

NOTE: At the beginning of each lesson, chapters or pages are designated in "Desire of Ages" and other books to which we are referred to find help upon the lesson. No better notes, or commentary, could possibly be written than those found in these books, and we urge that all provide themselves with these books and carefully study the references cited.

THE RECORD: The Gospel of John, the beloved disciple, written probably at Ephesus, near the close of the first century. This Gospel emphasizes the deity and divinity of Christ, and His rejection by His own people; and life through believing.

## Notes

1. The Greek term here rendered "word" is logos. The Son is here called the Word, because He was "God's thought made audible."

How far back "in the beginning" goes we may not say. We could not understand it if we were told. Suffice it to say that it was before the earth and stars were created.

2. In Him was and is life. The Gospel of John is the Gospel of life. Our Lord came to give the dying world what it needed most — life. And that life lived and given is the only salvation, the only guide, the only life to lead and save the souls of men.

3. "Lighteth every man." This is what Jesus has done. His spirit of conviction, of persuasion, of enlightenment, has gone unto all the earth's inhabitants. The doctrine of the future probation of man ignores this illuminating scripture.

4. The "right," the "power" (authority), the "privilege," to become a son of God is open to every soul. The receiving of Him is the yielding all of self to Him and accepting all from Him instead. It is self-denial, crucifixion, and believing on His name for cleansing, for life, for leading.

5. "The Word became flesh." Divinity tabernacled in the flesh of humanity. Not the flesh of sinless man, but such flesh as the children of earth possess. That was the glory of it. The divine Seed could manifest the glory of God in sinful flesh, even to absolute and perfect victory over any tendency of the flesh. This is the victory of our faith; for so Christ will dwell in our flesh, to conquer self and sin. See Gal. 2:20; 1 John 4:1-5.

6. Moses could only speak law. He had no life in himself to impart to the people. It was Moses' desire that the people should hear God speak and live. They refused and would listen only to the human, the voice of right words, but words devoid of life that would save. Christ Jesus spoke words of life and grace and truth. God's word received from man as the word of man is only cold, dead law.

7. "He hath declared Him." The Son of God came not to manifest Himself. All the grace, love, tenderness, and wisdom revealed were of God. The revelation of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the revelation of the Father, will be seen in the character of His people.
