## Sabbath-School Lessons on the LIFE OF CHRIST

INTRODUCTION: Previous Sabbath-school studies have given many precious lessons from the word of God. This quarter we begin a study of the life of the Master as revealed in the four Gospels. The lessons are upon the Incarnate Word; the Word lived and taught and exemplified in Jesus, Son of Man and Son of God, in whom it pleased the Father that all the fulness of the Godhead should dwell. Teachers and students should study these lessons, not simply for a Sabbath-school recitation, but for their life value.

"It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in contemplation of the life of Christ. We should take it point by point, and let the imagination grasp each scene, especially the closing ones. As we thus dwell upon His great sacrifice for us, our confidence in Him will be more constant, our love will be quickened, and we shall be more deeply imbued with His Spirit. If we would be saved at last, we must learn the lesson of penitence and humiliation at the foot of the cross.

"As we associate together, we may be a blessing to one another. If we are Christ's, our sweetest thoughts will be of Him. We shall love to talk of Him; and as we speak to one another of His love, our hearts will be softened by divine influences. Beholding the beauty of His character, we shall be 'changed into the same image from glory to glory.'"â€”"Desire of Ages," page 88.

Some of the Scripture answers to the questions of the lessons are long. Let the student remember: (1) This must be the case if we cover the entire Gospel record within the time allotted. (2) Such long scripture lessons will generally occur where the lesson is chiefly narrative. (3) There is no royal road, no easy path, to the attainment of the best things. No wealth of knowledge of the word of God can be gained without study. Read the entire lesson scripture through carefully, thoughtfully, and prayerfully. Stop and think through it, then read again. Do this before you read the questions. Fasten the main points in each question and answer in the mind by study, prayer, practice, and meditation.

In this study we have aimed as far as possible to follow the events of our Lord's earthly life in chronological sequence. We have followed in general the "Synopsis of the Gospels," by James P. Cadman, as given in his scholarly work, entitled "Christ in the Gospels," which is probably as good as any. In this Quarterly is found the synopsis of these lessons as given by Mr. Cadman. We would earnestly exhort the student of these lessons to read "Desire of Ages" for the light which it throws upon the life of the Master. However, it is almost impossible at times to refer to chapters in "Desire of Ages" commenting upon the scripture studied in a lesson. The student will find greater help if he will note the lesson scripture in any or all of the Gospels and then turn to the "Scriptural Index" in the "Desire of Ages" and there find the very pages in the book where the scripture in question is treated.

In "Christ's Object Lessons" much light is thrown upon the parables of our Lord, and this excellent book should also be freely used in the study of the lessons.

Study, too, the persons and the places named in the lessons. Consult a Bible dictionary or encyclopedia. Schaff's Bible Dictionary, the American Tract Society's, or Smith's Bible Dictionary, and Fausset's Bible Cyclopedia, are each excellent. An outline map of Palestine is in the Quarterly. This should be used, and all places mentioned in the lessons located.
