## Notes

1. "The Sea of Chinnereth (Num. 34:11), called in the New Testament, 'the Sea of Galilee' (Matt. 4:18), the 'Sea of Tiberias' (John 21:1), and the 'Sea' or 'Lake of Gennesaret' (Luke 5:1-11), which last is but a variation of the Hebrew name." — "Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia."

2. It would seem that Simon and the other disciples whom Jesus first called had gone back to their fishing when Jesus returned to Galilee.

3. We may, like the disciples who toiled all the night without results, in our labor for souls sometimes see no one won to Christ. Yet we should not become discouraged and abandon the work. Connect more fully with the Saviour, take Him on board the ship, and at the word let down the Gospel net, and it may enclose a multitude.

4. The disciples "forsook all" in order to follow Christ. No less is required of His people in this age. We can not serve God and mammon. Following Christ means a separation from the world.

5. "The mind of this wretched sufferer had been darkened by Satan, but in the Saviour's presence a ray of light had pierced the gloom. He was roused to long for freedom from Satan's control; but the demon resisted the power of Christ. When the man tried to appeal to Jesus for help, the evil spirit put words into his mouth, and he cried out in an agony of fear. The demoniac partially comprehended that he was in the presence of One who could set him free; but when he tried to come within reach of that mighty hand, another's will held him; another's words found utterance through him. The conflict between the power of Satan and his own desire for freedom was terrible." — "Desire of Ages," pages 255, 256.
