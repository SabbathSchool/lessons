# Lesson 11 — The Woman of Samaria

JUNE 12, 1909

## LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 4:1-42

## LESSON HELPS: "Desire of Ages," chapter 19; "Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 2, chapter 10

## PLACE: Shechem, or Sychar

## PERSONS: Jesus; John the Baptist; the woman of Samaria; the disciples; the Samaritans, a mixed people, their religion a mixture of the true and false. See 2 Kings 17:24-41

NOTE: It was about this time that John was cast into prison, as recorded in Luke 3:19, 20, for reproving Herod for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife. He was probably imprisoned in the castle of Machaerus (the Greek name means, The Black Fortress), east of the Dead Sea. Jesus went to Galilee on hearing this, and on His way passed through Samaria.

## Notes

1. "Jacob's well is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but was made famous by the meeting of Jesus with the woman of Samaria at that place, as recorded in John 4:5-30. It is located near Shechem, otherwise known as Sychar, the modern Nablus. This is one of the very few spots in Palestine which have been closely identified with our Saviour's presence. It is about half a mile north from Joseph's tomb at the base of Mt. Gerizim. Maundress, in 1698, found the depth of the well to be 105 feet, with 15 feet of water. Captain Anderson, who visited it in 1866, found it to be only 75 feet. It may have been twice that depth originally. When visited by Farrar in 1870, it was only about 20 feet deep, and was in a state of hopeless ruin." — "Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia."

"Sychar — a name of reproach applied by the Jews to Shechem." — Id.

2. One practical lesson to be gained from the narrative of this woman from the city of Sychar is that she began her work near her home. This is where we ought to begin. To the man whom the Saviour healed in the country of the Gadarenes, He said, "Go home to thy friends, and tell how great things the Lord hath done for thee." Mark 5:19. The world now is "white already to harvest," and faithful, home missionary work is the need of the hour.

3. Such is the effect of simple witness born for Christ. We would scarcely have selected this woman as the one to bring a revival of godliness to the wicked village of Sychar. But many "believed on Him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did." The secret of her success lies in the fact that she had a face-to-face talk with the Saviour. This changed her from a life of sin to a life of righteousness. Before we can bring souls to the Lord, we, too, must have a personal interview with Jesus, and experience a transformation of life.
