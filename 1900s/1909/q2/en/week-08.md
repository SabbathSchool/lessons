## Notes

1. I am not Elijah; that is, the personal Elijah for whom some of the Jews were looking. He was Elijah only in the sense of coming "in the spirit and power" of Elijah. Luke 1:17. To this our Lord refers in Matt. 11:14. "That prophet" doubtless refers to a belief which the Jews held that the prophet of Deut. 18:15, 18 was not the Messiah, but His forerunner. This error was not, however, held by all. Others thought He was one of the old prophets raised from the dead.

2. John counts it the highest honor in simply being a "voice" for God. He is a type of the remnant church. Like John they should not seek earthly glory, but be happy in being simply a "voice" for Him in this generation.
