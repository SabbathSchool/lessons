## Notes

1. Observe how explicit Luke is in giving details. No writer who cared for his reputation and who was not sure of his ground, would thus deliberately set down such detailed statements, so easily proved false if the story were not true. The facts of the record are well established.

2. To us as well as the people in the days of John the Baptist these words come as a warning. Cumberers of the ground are as displeasing to the Lord now as then. The severest rebukes administered by our Saviour when on the earth were directed against those who occupied a place in the vineyard, and yet bore no fruit.
