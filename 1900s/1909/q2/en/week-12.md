## Notes

1. Galilee "is the district which was of all others the most honored with the presence of our Saviour. Here He lived entirely until He was thirty years of age; and although, after the commencement of His ministry, He frequently visited the other provinces, it was here that He chiefly resided." — "Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia."

2. Nobleman. "The word so rendered in John 4:46 is the Greek bas-el-ee-kos, which is somewhat varied in signification. It may mean: (1) Descended from a king. (2) One belonging to the court. (3) A soldier of the king, in which latter sense it often occurs in Josephus. (4) Well born, used in the parable of the talents as a title of the person who placed his servants in charge of certain amounts, for which they were to be held accountable, thus testing their fidelity and ability." 

3. "Is not this Joseph's son?" The wisdom and power with which He spoke, and the gracious utterances which fell from His lips, greatly impressed the people, and unbelief began to give way. But they hardened their hearts. They remembered that He was "Joseph's son," that He was a "carpenter," and therefore reasoned that He could not be the Son of God.
