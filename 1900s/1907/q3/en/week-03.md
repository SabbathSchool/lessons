## Notes

1. We have found the condition of the covenant between God and His creatures to be "Obey and live," and that God has given all, both angels and men, the absolute power of choice. But this plan involved the idea of ultimate perfect harmony. That under the power of choice this condition could only be brought about by the destruction of those who are persistent, incorrigible, wrong choosers. Hence, death must be the penalty for, and consequence of, sin.

2. Law may be expressed in two forms, affirmative and negative. Affirmatively, it points out the right, is obligatory, and shows the path of duty. Negatively, it points out the sin, and is prohibitory, and shows the forbidden path.

3. Satan coveted power and position. He exalted himself above God. Those who followed him and fell with him placed him above God in their minds. Hence, all fallen angels violated God's covenant in the same way Adam did.

4. By those acts of sin both angels and man lost eternal life and were shut up under condemnation to death.
