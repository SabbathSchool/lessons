## Notes

1. Satan deceived Eve and led her to distrust God so that she fell through unbelief.

2. Since man fell by a disobedience which was the outgrowth of a lack of faith in God, it must be evident that man can be reinstated only by an obedience which is the outgrowth of faith in God.

3. Life must find expression, so a living faith must be expressed in some way. If no expression is given, it will die; but if it is exercised, it will grow.

4. Since the covenant is renewed in Christ by faith, we conclude that any divinely appointed ordinance which expresses faith is for the time being a part of the new covenant, or is a step in the renewal of the covenant. Before the death of Christ, sacrifices and offerings constituted the appointed way of expressing faith in a coming Saviour. So now the Lord's Supper, and baptism are the appointed ordinances by which we show our faith in a Saviour who has died, risen, and is coming again; and the former ceremonies sustained then the same relation to the new covenant that the latter ceremonies do now. Faith may be expressed in other ways, but in no case could these be a substitute for those appointed by God.

5. The steps of a man in entering the new covenant are:
   (a) Repentance toward God, including a confession of, and a turning away from, sin.
   (b) Faith in Christ as expressed in God's appointed way, and thereby receiving the righteousness of God;
   (c) This faith working by love and leading the man to obedience.

6. On God's part, the steps are:
   (a) Accepting man's repentance and faith in Christ, forgiving sin, and imputing to him God's righteousness.
   (b) Writing His law in the man's heart by the Holy Spirit so that the man can keep His commandments.
   (c) Eventually in the judgment blotting out the record of sin from the books of heaven.
