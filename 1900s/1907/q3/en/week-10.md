SEPTEMBER 7, 1907.

## Questions

INTRODUCTORY NOTE: We have found that the new covenant centers in Christ, and to accept Him by faith is to keep the new covenant. The preaching of Christ is the Gospel, so that by the preaching of the Gospel, the new covenant is set before men.

## Notes

1. Since the children of Christ are the children of Abraham and partakers of the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, we conclude that the term "Covenant with Abraham" is simply another name for the new covenant.

2. The term "Everlasting Covenant" is only another name for the new, or renewed covenant.

3. Thus we see that these terms are all applied to one and the same covenant, but in each one it is viewed from a different standpoint. From the standpoint of God and those beings who have never sinned, it is God's everlasting covenant; from the standpoint of sinners saved by faith, it is the new or renewed covenant; from the standpoint of an Israelite, it is the Abrahamic covenant; from the standpoint of the strife and confusion of sin, it is the covenant of peace.
