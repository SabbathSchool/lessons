## Notes

1. Christ could not be holden by death because He was the Prince of Life. Acts 3:15. Death could not retain dominion because the eternal Spirit had power over Him. Rom. 8:11. Death could not hold Him because His righteousness is life. Rom. 8:10. And as surely as Christ arose from the dead, so certainly will all the dead who belong to Him come forth from their graves.

2. "As Christ arose, He brought from the grave a multitude of captives. The earthquake at His death had rent open their graves, and when He arose, they came forth with him. They were those who had been colaborers with God, and who at the cost of their lives had borne testimony to the truth. Now they were to be witnesses for Him who had raised them from the dead...These went into the city and appeared unto many, declaring, Christ has risen from the dead, and we be risen with Him."—"Desire of Ages," pages 943, 944.

3. The work of teaching the Gospel to the people of this world is still in progress, and the injunction to pray for the Holy Spirit is yet an imperative need. "The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result, but the 'latter rain' will be more abundant. All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit, will be constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the breath of His own Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls."—"Desire of Ages," page 993.

4. It was appropriate that the Redeemer should take some of the trophies of His victory to heaven with Him when He ascended. Those who came out of their graves when He arose were representatives of His kingdom, who had lived in different ages of the world. Rev. 5:9, 10.
