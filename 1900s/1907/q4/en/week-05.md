## Notes

1. The prophetic period referred to in verse 25 relates to, and covers the time of, papal supremacy, which began in A.D. 538, when the last of the three opposing powers (the Vandals, Heruli, and Ostrogoths) was plucked up. The Revelator says that this power was to continue for a "time, times, and half a time" (Rev. 12:14), or forty-two months. Prophetic time is calculated on the basis of one day for a year (Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:3-6). As the period of papal supremacy began in 538 A.D., and was to continue for a time, times, and the dividing of time, or forty-two months, or three and a half years prophetic time, it would reach to 1798 A.D. Precisely at the termination of this period in A.D. 1798, General Bernier took the pope of Rome prisoner, and carried him to Valance, in France, where he died in exile.

2. The Papacy was to think to change, or think itself able to change, God's law. No human power could change the law of God.
