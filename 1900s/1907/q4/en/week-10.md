## Notes

1. "It has been Satan's purpose to divorce mercy from truth and justice. He sought to prove that the righteousness of God's law is an enemy to peace. But Christ shows that in God's plan they are indissolubly joined together; the one can not exist without the other. 'Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.'"—"Desire of Ages," page 916, Trade Edition.

2. Since the law of the Lord is perfect, any departure from its precepts is sin. To change it would destroy its perfection; therefore, any attempted change is a transgression of it.

"In the holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of it was purest gold. On each end of the ark was a lovely cherub, with its wings spread out over it. Their faces were turned toward each other, and they looked downward. Between the angels was a golden censer. Above the ark, where the angels stood, was an exceeding bright glory that appeared like a throne where God dwelt. Jesus stood by the ark, and as the saints' prayers came up to Him, the incense in the censer would smoke, and He would offer up their prayers with the smoke of the incense to His Father."—"Early Writings," page 26.
