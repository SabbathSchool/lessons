## Notes

1. An absolute Creator must be able to bring into being that which before was non-existent. Thus the apostle says, "The worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear." Heb. 11:3, A. R. V.

2. God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The decree of the Lord, "Let there be," in each step in creation made it so.

3. God's Spirit invariably accompanies His word, so that Jesus could say of that which He declared, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." John 6:63. In creation it is said, "the Spirit of God moved upon ["was brooding upon," margin, A. R. V.] the face of the waters." Thus "God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures." "And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherein the waters swarmed, after their kind." Gen 1:2, 20, 21, A. R. V.

4. Those who meditate upon God's word day and night, become imbued with the Spirit in the word and are thereby kept from transgression.
