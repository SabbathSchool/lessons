## Note

Our eyes may deceive us, and our ears may fail to correctly understand, but the prophetic word is infallible and will surely be fulfilled. It is more certain than the seeing of the eyes, or the hearing of the ears, for it can not fail. Prophecy shines into a dark place, throwing light upon the future.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest."
