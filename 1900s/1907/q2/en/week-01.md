## Notes

1. **Calling and Election** - It is not the purpose of these lessons to answer objections to a teaching of which the Bible knows nothing, but to aid in the study of a most encouraging and helpful doctrine. The Bible teaches election, foreordination, predestination, but always for our comfort and edification. The "calling," the "inviting," and "appointing" precede and throw light on the "election."

2. **"Called From"** - We are called from all that is unlike Him who calls us, from things natural to us. We are not by nature good, or pure, or righteous. We by nature walk according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, according to the spirit working in the sons of disobedience, according to the lusts of the flesh; we are children of wrath. Be not deceived into placing humanity on a higher plane than God places them, and so lead them to minimize the Saviour. Let us take comfort in the thought that God calls us from all this evil to the better things.

3. **Saints** - The word "saint" means a holy one. But while God calls us to be saints, and by His Spirit calls His children saints, we never find the devoted servants of God calling themselves saints. Their choicest title seems to be "servant." "Paul, a servant of God." God calls us to be saints, makes us children, calls us friends, but we are His servants.
