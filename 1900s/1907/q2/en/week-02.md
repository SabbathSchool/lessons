## Notes

1. **"Show in Thee My Power"** - God is no respecter of persons. He sent Abraham to Egypt to save Egypt. He sent Joseph there for the same purpose. And when Moses presented God's reasonable message, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me," Pharaoh might have received that message, and it would have brought him life and blessing, and would have made of Egypt, in its knowledge of the true God, a light center. Not until God had exhausted every effort upon Pharaoh's heart, did He withdraw His Spirit, and so leave Pharaoh to his fate.

2. **"My Servant"** - God had a work for Nebuchadnezzar to do; but it took Nebuchadnezzar long to learn the lesson. Daniel 2, Daniel 3, and Daniel 4 are records of his education and advancement, until he came to the knowledge of God.
