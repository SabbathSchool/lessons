## Notes

1. **"Apostle"** - It is the Greek word transferred and anglicized. It means a delegate, a messenger, an ambassador, a commissioner, "one sent forth."

2. Jesus expressly called the twelve apostles. Luke 6:13. But these were not all the apostles. See Matthias (Acts 1:26); Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14:14); James, the Lord's brother (Gal. 1:19); Epaphroditus, "messenger," literally apostle (Phil. 2:25), and others perhaps, messengers, apostles (2 Cor. 8:23), besides the great Apostle, our Lord Jesus Christ (Heb. 3:1). Here are eighteen or more persons designated as apostles, those sent forth of God to lead out and build up His work in the earth.

3. **"Teachers"** - There is ability to teach. There is the art of teaching that may be acquired. All this is effective in the world. But these alone are sounding brass and tinkling cymbals in God's cause. The spiritual truth of God can be taught only by men who are spiritually endowed teachers. Preaching and teaching are great professions now, and the greatest preparations are made in the schools; but often spiritual results are lacking. So it will ever be if we slight the Spirit of God, the only power which can regenerate, endow, and fit us for our work.

4. Among the other gifts are evangelists, pastors, working of miracles, healing, helps, governments, tongues, interpretation of tongues, word of knowledge, word of wisdom, discerning of spirits, ministry, exhortation, giving. Nearly all of these are self-explanatory. An evangelist is preeminently one who preaches the Gospel, winning souls to Christ, gathering them into the flock. A pastor is one qualified of God to care for those gathered in, a shepherd of the flock. An evangelist may be a poor shepherd. A good pastor may be a poor evangelist. How often we find men that know above others just how to help, succor, relieve, at the opportune moment. They have a gift. Some are adapted to govern. Some have great knowledge and little wisdom, and others vice versa. Both are useful; let the church recognize them both. There are some who have discernment. They see the wrong motives, the false hearts, the subterfuges, of the deceiver. Neither are they "judges" in Israel. But what need of humility is there in its use. The blessed gift of service - common to all - all may use. Let the church plan to use all these gifts of God.

5. No gift of the Spirit of God, without which we can do no acceptable work for Him, can be acquired. No labor can secure it; no committee can bestow it; no money can purchase it; it can not come to us by any inheritance of the flesh. It is the gift of God. Education may help to develop, discipline, and make more effective the exercise of the gift; but it can do no more.
