## Notes

1. **"Eternal Purpose"** - Literally, "the purpose of the ages," the purpose of God before the world was, the purpose in the creation of man, the purpose in the patriarchal age, in the Levitical age, in the Christian age; it is the same eternal purpose of the unchangeable God through all the ages.

2. Our danger lies, not in the failure of God's grace or purpose or plan or mercy. His mercy and grace are inexhaustible. Our danger lies in rejecting His mercy till we can no longer discern His voice, no longer see His message, no longer feel His presence. We may harden our hearts till God is compelled to leave us alone to reap the fruit of our own sowing.

3. God's purpose is only and ever to do good. That, however, can be worked out only in harmony with righteous principle. All outside of that purpose is outside of the great channels of life, and must perish. When, therefore, we reject or refuse God's plan to save us, we put ourselves outside of God's purpose and plan, and must perish.
