## Notes

1. Man is "without strength," he has no power to help himself. Let him strive as he will, he still comes short of God's glory. He has physical life, fed by food and water and air; but he is "separate from Christ," "alienated from the life of God," "having no hope, and without God in the world." Eph. 4:18; 2:12. No philosophy can change the great fact so clearly stated in the Bible, and everywhere demonstrated in the history of the race.

2. A power must take possession of man that he has not known, to lift him above sin. He must be "born from above." The Spirit of God puts new life into the heart opened by faith, and creates new affections.

3. The Spirit is life to the believer, the life which comes by faith in Christ. 1 John 5:11-13. "When the sinner has repented of his sins, and is united with Christ, as the branch is engrafted in the vine, the nature of the man is changed, and he is a partaker of the divine nature.... The life-giving principle of the Saviour is communicated to the Christian." - Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 3, page 90. "All professions of Christianity are but lifeless expressions of faith until Jesus imbues the believer with His spiritual life, which is the Holy Ghost." - Id., page 242. "The Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. It imbues the receiver with the attributes of Christ." - Desire of Ages, page 805, large edition.
