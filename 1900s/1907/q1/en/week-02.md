## Notes

1. These cities were substantially built. Many of them had been built by the heathen that dwelt in the land before Israel came from Egypt. Deut. 6:10; Joshua 24:13. During the seventy years' captivity, these cities had remained the same and stood ready to receive those that returned from captivity.

   Travelers state that in some portions of Palestine the ancient cities still remain. Mr. Porter in "Giant Cities of Bashan," speaks of one of these cities as follows:
   
   "Selcah is one of the most remarkable cities of Palestine. It has been long deserted; and yet, as nearly as I could estimate, five hundred of its houses are still standing, and three or four hundred families might settle in it at any moment without laying a stone, or expending an hour's labor on repairs." If some of the cities are still standing, it is easy to understand how Israel was so quickly settled in their cities.

2. At the right and left of the breastplate were two large stones of great brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and Thummim. By them, the will of God was made known through the high priest. When questions were brought for decision before the Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone at the right was a token of the divine consent or approval, while a cloud shadowing the stone at the left, was an evidence of the denial or disapprobation. - Patriarchs and Prophets, chapter 30.

3. Only a small proportion heeded this call to "come out of Babylon." They loved their houses and lands in Babylon better than the Lord and His temple. Many remain in modern Babylon today for the same reason.
