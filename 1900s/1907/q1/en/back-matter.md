# An After-the-fire Story

By the Book Department Manager

When the 5 P.M. bell rang Friday, July 20, our press-room boys were finishing a twenty-thousand edition of "Heralds of the Morning." The plates for the last form were still on the press.

Five thousand copies were in process of binding on the gathering boards and around the bindery sewing machines.

Fifty full Morocco prospectuses were being finished for delivery the following Monday to as many anxious agents whose old cloth prospectuses were badly worn.

Two hundred eleven copies of the complete book, new edition, had been delivered to the shipping room that afternoon, and had been forwarded to our Kansas City house, with the exception of a sample copy which had been sent to the writer's home.

In the field there were more than one hundred agents successfully soliciting orders.

## AND THAT NIGHT THE FIRE CAME

The most of the following night was spent in counsel by the Board of Directors, foremen, and others.

Before the flames had died down, one of our most experienced men was on a fast train bound for the East, with the sample copy of "Heralds of the Morning," and with orders to secure the publication of a large edition at the earliest possible moment.

As the plates and engravings were all gone, this was no light task.

So successful was he in his mission that within ten days after the fire a ten-thousand edition of the book had been contracted for with a large Kansas City firm; and typesetting machines and photo-engravers had begun work.

And here came a strange experience. Our agents, many of them, had poor prospectuses, some of them torn, others nearly worn out. They pasted in loose leaves, sewed in sheets of writing-paper for additional names, but they all kept at work.

Girls without previous experience took orders for $50.00, $60.00, $68.50, and then some one jumped up to $100.00, $150.00, and some experienced workers up to $240.00, $255.00, and finally one man took orders for $280.00 worth of this book in a single week.

Remember, this was done with old prospectuses, and at a time when the securing of books was somewhat questionable.

It proves, beyond a doubt, that "Heralds of the Morning" is a book with a mission; that its mission is one in which the people of the world are interested.

When, after various delays, books began to be delivered, orders had piled up so that almost four thousand copies—about four tons—had to be sent by express, at mail rates.

One agent in an almost inaccessible portion of California had to have nearly one hundred books sent to him by mail. Imagine the surprise of the mail carrier, who usually carries three or four pounds of mail, to receive a consignment to one party of 200 pounds! But orders had been taken and books must be delivered, even though Uncle Sam's letter carriers had to be pressed into service.

It was soon found that the three hundred copies being delivered each day were not sufficient, hence the following telegram was sent to our Kansas City representative:

"Try St. Louis binders for 'Heralds' and Controversy.' Try make forfeiture contract."

In a few hours back flashed this message, "Binding material all here. Kansas City firm signs penalty contract to-day. Letter:"

When the letter came it contained copy of a contract calling for a heavy forfeiture for every day in which at least 500 copies of "Heralds of the Morning" were not delivered.

In a few more days this telegram came: "'Heralds' all sold. Shall we print five thousand more?"

And, of course, we said, "Yes."

And now we are preparing for 1907.

First, "Heralds of the Morning" is being translated into German, Swedish, and Danish.

Secondly, new engravings have been added, together with chapter on recent calamities.

Thirdly, a beautiful new prospectus, designed by those who have been selling the book most successfully, is being printed.

Fourthly, a canvass, which, for brevity, directness, simplicity, and selling points, has seldom, if ever, been equaled, has been worked out by expert salesmen.

Fifthly, although in its revised and enlarged form the book contains nearly 400 pages, we have decided to keep the price down to $1.75. This applies to the English, German, Danish, and Swedish editions.

Sixthly, the plates for the book have been recalled from Kansas City, and among the first printing to be done in our new Pacific Press home will be a twenty-thousand run on "Heralds of the Morning," which we hope will be the first instalment of a one-hundred-thousand copy edition to be manufactured and sold during 1907.

If you wish to have a part in placing that many copies of this message-filled book in the homes of the people, talk with or write to your tract society secretary or state agent and ask for the canvass. It's free.
