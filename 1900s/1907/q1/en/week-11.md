## Notes

1. It was Ezra's intimacy with the Lord that caused the king to grant all his requests; "it was according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him." The same intimacy today will bring like results.

2. From the record given in Ezra 8:1-14, there were over fifteen hundred males in the company that went up with Ezra. With women and children this made a large party.

3. It was not the safety of the party only, but the honor of God that was at stake. The king had granted every request and may have offered a guard, but Ezra had told the king of the power of God to deliver.

4. The desert was infested with bands of robbers, then as now, and it was not safe for a caravan to cross the desert without a guard of armed men.

5. The strictest business policy should be used in dealing with the Lord's treasure. Notice how accurate Ezra was. Every article was both weighed and counted, and the record kept. "Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently." Jer. 48:10 (margin).
