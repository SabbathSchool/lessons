# SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSONS FOR SENIOR DIVISION

## A Study of the Book of Ezra
FIRST QUARTER, 1907

### GENERAL NOTE

The book of Ezra contains the key to a proper understanding of the message that proclaims the opening of the investigative judgment in the heavenly courts. Daniel states that the twenty-three hundred years which mark the beginning of the judgment, would begin with the "going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem"; but the book of Ezra contains the only divine record of the going forth of that commandment.
