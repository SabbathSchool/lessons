## Notes

1. Cyrus evidently believed in the god of good and evil much as the Parsees of India do today, and that the God of the Hebrews was a powerful God, and to secure His favor would greatly increase his power.

2. Daniel was a prominent man in the Persian court, and no doubt had instructed Cyrus in regard to the prophecy of Jeremiah, as we find Daniel earnestly studying these prophecies three years before Cyrus issued his decree. Dan. 9:1, 2.

3. The call was to all God's people, and if all had heeded the call, the work would have gone forward rapidly.

4. Nebuchadnezzar respected sacred things and placed these holy vessels in the best place he had, viz., in the treasure-house of his god.

5. While they were drinking wine from those sacred vessels, a hand appeared writing upon the wall. Consternation and confusion followed, and while they were in this condition the army of Cyrus entered the city and slew the king and the princes. Dan. 5:30, 31; Jer. 51:57. The sacred vessels must have been scattered throughout the banquet hall. Who was there with power to gather them? The last kingly act of Belshazzar was to publicly proclaim Daniel the third ruler in the kingdom. Dan. 5:29. This gave Daniel power to command the servants to search carefully for all the sacred vessels and restore them to a place of safety.
