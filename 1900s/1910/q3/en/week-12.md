## Notes

1. Christians pray to God to send them the Comforter — the Holy Ghost. This is proper and right. But we may forget that sometimes the only real comfort the Holy Ghost can administer to us is to reveal our unconfessed and unforsaken sins. To get these put away, is the best and most lasting comfort that He can bestow. Isa. 57:17-21. If He thus comes as a reprover, we must still count Him as the Comforter. But to experience the comfort, we must immediately confess the sin to God, and make right any wrong we may have done others. This done, there will be no disappointment in experiencing the promised comfort. Acts 2:37-39; Rev. 3:18, 19.

2. "The work of the Spirit in believers. (1) Teaching (John 14:26); (2) guiding into all truth (John 16:13); (3) bearing witness (John 15:26; Acts 5:32); (4) giving life (Rom. 8:11); (5) bestowing the living water (John 4:14; 7:38, 39); (6) bestowing gifts, as of teaching, tongues, etc. (1 Cor. 12:7-11); (7) shedding the love of God abroad in them (Rom. 5:5); (8) producing goodness and high morality (Gal. 5:22, 23; Acts 11:24); (9) bestowing power (Acts 1:8; Rom. 15:19); (10) bestowing wisdom (Eph. 1:17)."—Peloubet's Notes.

3. Here is an exhibition of the faith of Jesus. With no home, no earthly honor or wealth, and within a few hours of a criminal's death, He promised His believers a share in all the riches and glory of heaven. Being the Father's, He claimed these treasures as His own, and if His, then ours. He had given up all, He claimed all. 2 Cor. 8:9. If we renounce all, like Him, we may claim all. Rom. 8:32.

4. Peter and the rest had avowed their allegiance in strong terms (Matt. 26:33-35). They were now within two or three hours of their great test. For it they were unprepared. Jesus knew better than they the strength of the temptation awaiting them. The Shepherd was to be smitten (Zech. 13:7), and the sheep scattered. (See margin, John 16:32.) It will be observed that this final stroke to the eleven came suddenly. Another similar hour of trial awaits the remnant. But a living faith and trust in God and His Word will pass the believer triumphant through this final test into the city Jesus has gone to prepare for His saints.
