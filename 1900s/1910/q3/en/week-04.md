## Notes

1. In the first investment of Jerusalem by the Roman army, Cestius advanced to the inner wall and pitched his camp opposite the strong positions of the palace and the temple. "Had he immediately assailed the walls in front of him, we are told he would have had an easy victory; but, like not a few generals of besieging armies, he preferred caution to dash, and so allowed the favorable moment to pass unimproved. Josephus deplores this delay, since, in his opinion, the capture of the city at that time would at once have ended the war. He lays the blame on the governor, Florus, who for his own purpose desired that the war should be prolonged. Florus, he says, bribed a great number of the Roman officers, and so prevented an immediate attack.

"A large party of the people now made overtures to Cestius, and offered to open the gates for him. Again he hesitated, until the Zealots within discovered the plot and punished its authors by throwing them down from the city wall. For five days the Romans continued their desultory attacks without success. They then assailed the northern wall of the temple, and when the Jewish darts rained down upon them like hailstones, they put their shields over their heads, and standing or crouching close together, lapped one shield over the edge of another, and thus formed a complete covering like the crust or shell of a single huge animal; this arrangement was known as the testudo, or tortoise, and was a regular and effective maneuver of the Roman army in carrying on a siege.

"And now a horrible fear ran through the city as the Roman soldiers, under the protection of their shields, maintained their ground, undermined the wall, and prepared to set fire to the gate of the temple. But of this panic Cestius seemed not to be aware, and if he heard of the existence of a large body of sympathizers within the walls, he either did not believe it or did not care to trust his army to them. Suddenly he suspended operations, renounced his advantages, and withdrew from the temple wall. It was an act so difficult to account for that naturally it was ascribed to a higher power than man. Josephus regarded it as proving the divine anger, for he believed that if the city had been captured then all the subsequent horrors of the war would have been avoided. Others supposed that this was the opportunity pointed out to the disciples by the Saviour, when they might escape to a place of safety and avoid all the coming woes of the siege."—"Exile to Overthrow," pages 303, 304.

2. "Not one Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem. Christ had given His disciples warning, and all who believed His words watched for the promised sign... After the Romans under Cestius had surrounded the city, they unexpectedly abandoned the siege when everything seemed favorable for an immediate attack... Events were so overruled that neither Jews nor Romans should hinder the flight of the Christians. Upon the retreat of Cestius, the Jews, sallying from Jerusalem, pursued after his retiring army, and while both forces were thus fully engaged, the Christians had an opportunity to leave the city. At this time the country also had been cleared of enemies who might have endeavored to intercept them. At the time of the siege, the Jews were assembled at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus the Christians throughout the land were able to make their escape unmolested. Without delay they fled to a place of safety,— the city of Pella, in the land of Perea, beyond Jordan."—"Great Controversy," pages 30, 31.

3. The "days" of "great tribulation" Jesus here speaks of can be no other than the long period of 1260 years of papal persecution through which the church was to pass, when millions of the saints of God were cruelly put to death as heretics. Dan. 7:25; Rev. 12:6, 13, 14. These days of papal supremacy began in 538 A.D., and ended in 1798. But Jesus said the time of persecution should be "shortened." As a result of the Reformation under Luther and his associates, Jesus' words met their literal fulfillment in that the days of persecution were "shortened."

4. The second coming of Jesus cannot be counterfeited. Jesus comes in person. Acts 1:10, 11. He cometh with the glory of His Father. Matt. 16:27. He is accompanied by all the holy angels, who come in all their glory. Rev. 8:1; Luke 9:26. He touches not the earth, but remains in the air, sending His angels to bring to Him the resurrected saints and those who have been changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. 1 Thess. 4:16, 17; Matt. 24:31. The whole earth will be lightened by His approach, and every eye shall see Him. Matt. 24:27; Rev. 1:7. It will be impossible for Satan to counterfeit the coming of Jesus as outlined in these words of Scripture. Thus none need be deceived by the false teaching concerning the coming of Christ. Jesus has forewarned His people, so that none need be in ignorance concerning this important event.

5. "Almost if not altogether alone as the most mysterious and as yet unexplained phenomenon of its kind in nature's diversified range of events during the last century, stands the dark day of May 19, 1780, a most unaccountable darkening of the whole visible heavens and atmosphere in New England, which brought intense alarm and distress to multitudes of minds, as well as dismay to the brute creation, the fowls fleeing, bewildered, to their roosts, and the birds to their nests, and the cattle returning to their stalls. Indeed, thousands of the good people of that day became fully convinced that the end of all things terrestrial had come; many gave up, for the time, their secular pursuits, and betook themselves to religious devotions."—"Our First Century," page 88.

Burritt's "Geography of the Heavens," page 163, edition 1854, says of the star shower of 1833:

"The most sublime phenomenon of shooting stars of which the world has furnished any record, was witnessed throughout the United States on the morning of the 13th of November, 1833. The entire extent of this astonishing exhibition has not been precisely ascertained; but it covered no inconsiderable portion of the earth's surface... The whole heavens seemed in motion, and suggested to some the awful grandeur of the image employed in the Apocalypse, upon the opening of the sixth seal, when 'the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.'"
