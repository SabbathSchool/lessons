## Notes

1. "There can not be doubt that the first discourse was spoken while at the supper table. It connects itself closely with that statement which had caused them [the disciples] so much sorrow and perplexity, that, whither He was going, they could not come; ... the two great elements in the discourse being, teaching and comfort."—Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," page 513.

"The object of Christ's departure was the opposite of what the disciples feared. It did not mean a final separation. He was going to prepare a place for them; that He might come again, and receive them unto Himself. While He was building mansions for them, they were to build characters after the divine similitude."—"Desire of Ages," page 666.

2. "By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work would be of a more exalted character than His, but that it would have greater extent. He did not refer merely to miracle-working, but to all that would take place under the working of the Holy Spirit."—"Desire of Ages," page 664. Acts 2:1-11; Col. 1:5, 6.

3. The condition upon which Jesus promises to send the Holy Spirit to any one, is that he loves Him and keeps His commandments. The Revised Version reads, "Ye will keep My commandments."

4. "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended on high." "Desire of Ages," page 669.

5. What better and more valuable legacy could Jesus bequeath His children than His own blessed peace — that heavenly peace which the world can neither give nor take away? It is of more value than gold or silver or diamonds. He said, "My peace I give unto you." Let us take it, and be at rest in Him, amid the troubles of life which surround us. Matt. 11:28, 29; Isa. 30:15; Phil. 4:7.

6. "'Hath nothing in Me.' There is in Me no principle or feeling that accords with his, and nothing, therefore, by which he can prevail."—Barnes's Notes, volume 2, page 365.

7. "Before leaving the upper chamber, the Saviour led His disciples in a song of praise. His voice was heard, not in the strains of some mournful lament, but in the joyful notes of the Passover hallel [Psalm 117]:

"'O praise the Lord, all ye nations;
Praise Him, all ye people.
For His merciful kindness is great toward us,
And the truth of the Lord endureth forever.
Praise ye the Lord.'"
—"Desire of Ages," page 672.
