## Notes

1. "With Judas an element of antagonism was introduced among the disciples... Though recognizing the divine power of the love of Christ, Judas did not yield to its supremacy. He continued to cherish his own judgment and opinions, his disposition to criticize and condemn. Christ's motives and movements, often so far above his comprehension, excited doubt and disapproval, and his own questionings and ambitions were insinuated to the disciples. Many of their contentions for supremacy, much of their dissatisfaction with Christ's methods, originated with Judas."—"Education," pages 91, 92. Matt. 18:1; Mark 9:33, 34.

2. "Another cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it was customary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests, and on this occasion preparation had been made [by Peter and John] for the service. The pitcher, the basin, and the towel were there, in readiness for the feet-washing; but no servant was present, and it was the disciples' part to perform it. But each of the disciples, yielding to wounded pride, determined not to act the part of a servant. All manifested a stoical unconcern, seeming unconscious that there was anything for them to do. By their silence they refused to humble themselves."—"Desire of Ages," page 644.

"Such girding was the common mark of a slave, by whom the service of foot-washing was ordinarily performed."—Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, pages 501, 502.

3. "So far as Judas himself was concerned, Christ's work of love had been without avail. But not so as regards his fellow disciples. To them it was a lesson of lifelong influence. Ever would its example of tenderness and long-suffering mold their intercourse with the tempted and the erring. And it had other lessons. At the ordination of the twelve, the disciples had greatly desired that Judas should become one of their number; and they had counted his accession an event of much promise to the apostolic band... But the methods he desired to introduce into Christ's work were based upon worldly principles and were controlled by worldly policy." "Education," page 93.

4. "Christ would have His disciples understand that although He had washed their feet, this did not in the least detract from His dignity... Being so infinitely superior, He imparted grace and significance to the service. No one was so exalted as Christ, and yet He stooped to the humblest duty."—"Desire of Ages," page 649.

"Ye also ought to wash one another's feet." The Standard Dictionary says: "Ought is used chiefly as auxiliary, expressing obligation or fitness. To be under moral obligation to be or do; be bound in duty or by the principles of right." Ye are bound by duty, by an obligation, to do as I have done, to wash one another's feet. Not simply be willing to do it, but do it. And in the doing, happiness will be found.

5. The word "servant" was often applied to a slave. Judas regarded Jesus at the feet-washing as a slave, and it is quite significant that he sold Him for just thirty pieces of silver — the acknowledged price of a slave. "For thirty pieces of silver — the price of a slave — he sold the Lord of Glory to ignominy and death."—"Desire of Ages," page 716.
