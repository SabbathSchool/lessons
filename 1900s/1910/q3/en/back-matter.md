# Stereopticon Slides On the Life of Christ

THE Young People's Missionary Volunteer Department has secured a well-selected list of seventy colored stereopticon slides on the Life of Christ. These slides will be rented to our institutions or churches desiring to give a program on this subject.

An hour spent looking at these masterpieces on the Saviour's life, and rehearsing the precious story, will do much to fix the Sabbath-school lessons on the minds of all, especially the children and young people.

The department also has some illustrated songs,â€”"God Be with You till We Meet Again," one slide; "Onward, Christian Soldiers," one slide; "Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy," four slides; "Throw Out the Life-Line," four slides; "The Ninety and Nine," ten slides.

These slides will be rented for four cents each for four days counting from the time they leave the office until returned, and one cent per slide for each additional day; two days free to points west of the Mississippi River, and three days to points west of the Rocky Mountains. The renter pays the express each way.
