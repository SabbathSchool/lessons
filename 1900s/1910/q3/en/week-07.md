## Notes

1. From this point, Jesus prepares to enter the final struggle with the prince of darkness. His public ministry is ended. His heart yearningly turns to His disciples. He is closeted, as it were, with them, and imparts all the instruction He sees they can bear. Much that He longs to tell them is stayed upon His lips; for they are not ready. His hour has now come, but they are unprepared for it.

2. It will be observed that the Bible record lifts the veil and reveals the principal events taking place within two circles — that of Jesus and His little band, and that of Satan and those closely allied with him. First we are shown the one, and then the other.

3. "We look with horror upon the treachery of Judas; but his case represents a large class who file in under the banner of Christ, yet are really His worst enemies. They worship only self and money, and use the name of Christian as a cloak to hide their evil deeds. They sell their integrity for money, and their Saviour for a little worldly advantage."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 82, 83.

4. "The request of James and John to sit on the right and left of Christ's throne, had excited the indignation of the others... Judas was the most severe upon James and John. When the disciples entered the supper-room, their hearts were full of resentful feelings. Judas pressed next to Christ on the left side; John was on the right. If there was a highest place, Judas was determined to have it, and that place was thought to be next to Christ. And Judas was a traitor."—"Desire of Ages," pages 643, 644.

5. Jesus was seeking to save Judas. This general statement was designed to draw from Judas a heartfelt confession of his crime. Now was his opportunity to confess his guilt and receive the Saviour's pardon. As in the case of Achan, of old, the Lord made it as easy as possible for Judas to free himself from the snare in which he was taken, by confessing his sin.
