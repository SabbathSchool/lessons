## Notes

1. "As they realized the full import of His words and remembered how true His sayings were, a sudden fear and self-distrust seized them. They began to examine their own hearts to ascertain if one thought against the Master found lodgment there. With the most painful feelings, one after another inquired, 'Lord, is it I?' But Judas sat silent."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 85, 86.

2. "John in deep distress at last inquired, 'Lord, who is it?' And Jesus answered, 'He that dippeth his hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me. The Son of man goeth as it is written of Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for that man if he had not been born.' The disciples had searched one another's faces closely as they asked, 'Lord, is it I?' And now the silence of Judas drew all eyes to him. Amid the confusion of questions and expressions of astonishment, Judas had not heard the words of Jesus in answer to John's question. But now, to escape the scrutiny of the disciples, he asked as they had done, 'Master, is it I?' Jesus solemnly replied, 'Thou hast said.'"—"Desire of Ages," page 654.

3. "Though Jesus knew Judas from the beginning, He washed his feet. And the betrayer was privileged to unite with Christ in partaking of the sacrament. ... This example is for us. When we suppose one to be in error and sin, we are not to divorce ourselves from him. ... Christ's example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord's supper. It is true that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy Spirit plainly teaches (1 Cor. 5:11). But beyond this none are to pass judgment."—"Desire of Ages," pages 655, 656.

4. Instead of to an earthly kingdom, Jesus directed their minds to that time when they should be with Him again in the kingdom of God. He also connected the important events of His death with His second coming — a hope that was to cheer the believer until the close of time. 1 Cor. 11:26.

5. "In surprise and confusion at the exposure of his purpose, Judas rose hastily to leave the room. 'Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. ... He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.' Night it was to the traitor as he turned away from Christ into the outer darkness. Until this step was taken, Judas had not passed beyond the possibility of repentance. But when he left the presence of his Lord and his fellow disciples, the final decision had been made. He had passed the boundary line."—"Desire of Ages," page 654.

6. To love one another, was not a new precept. But never before had the world witnessed such love as the love of Jesus. The new feature of this command was "that ye love one another" "as I have loved you." John 13:1; Rom. 5:5; 1 John 3:18, 14.

7. "Had Jesus remained silent, in apparent ignorance of that which was to come upon Him, an impression might have been left on the minds of His disciples that their Master had not divine foresight."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 87.

8. "Over and over again, on the very verge of ruin, Peter's words of boasting brought him nearer and still nearer to the brink. Over and over again was given the warning, 'Thou shalt ... deny that thou knowest Me.' ... When in the judgment-hall the words of denial had been spoken; when Peter's love and loyalty, awakened under the Saviour's glance of pity and love and sorrow, had sent him forth to the garden where Christ had wept and prayed; when his tears of remorse dropped upon the sod that had been moistened with the blood-drops of His agony,— then the Saviour's words, 'I have prayed for thee; ... when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren,' were a stay to his soul. Christ, though foreseeing his sin, had not abandoned him to despair."—"Education," page 89.
