## Notes

1. The parable of the talents is an explanation of the waiting time between Jesus' departure and His return. The parable of the ten virgins emphasizes the need of continual preparation for the Master's return; this of the talents, the use of the time during His absence. The words, "Occupy till I come" (Luke 19:13), show that this parable reaches, as does that of the ten virgins, to the end of the world.

2. "'His goods.' His property — representing the offices, abilities, and opportunities for doing good, which He has given to His professed followers." "The word 'talents' here is used to denote indefinitely a large sum, and is designed to refer to the endowments conferred on men. We have retained in our language the word 'talent' as referring to the abilities or gifts of men."—Barnes's Notes, volume 1, page 318.

3. "It needs no comment to show that his [the one-talent servant's] own words, however honest and self-righteous they might sound, admitted dereliction of his work and duty as a servant, and entire misunderstanding as well as heart-alienation from his master. He served him not, and he knew him not; he loved him not, and he sympathized not with him. But, besides, his answer was also an insult and a mendacious pretext. He had been idle and unwilling to work for his master. If he worked, it would be for himself. He would not incur the difficulties, the self-denial, perhaps the reproach, connected with his master's work. We recognize here those who, although His servants, yet, from selfish indulgence and worldliness, will not do work for Christ with the one talent entrusted to them — that is, even though the responsibility and claim upon them be the smallest"—Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 462.

4. "Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their ears they have befriended the missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own lives... How glad will be the heart of Infinite Love as His followers look up with surprise and joy at His words of approval."—"Desire of Ages," page 638.
