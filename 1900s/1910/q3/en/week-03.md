## Notes

1. God hardens the heart of no one save as the rejection of His mercy leaves the heart ever harder. It is the attitude of the individual to the light and truth God sends, that effects changes upon the heart. While the gospel continues, God will seek to draw men unto Himself. Rev. 22:17, He is no respecter of persons. But when we refuse to walk in the light, reject the gracious wooing of the Spirit, rebel against correction, we harden our hearts. Thus it was with Pharaoh; thus it was with the Jews; thus it is today. Heb. 3:12, 13, 15. Observe that in verse 37 reference is made to the unbelief of the Jews.

2. "Jesus did not answer His disciples by taking up separately the destruction of Jerusalem and the great day of His coming. He mingled the description of these two events. Had He opened to His disciples future events as He beheld them, they would have been unable to endure the sight. In mercy to them He blended the description of the two great crises, leaving the disciples to study out the meaning for themselves. When He referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His prophetic words reached beyond that event to the final conflagration in that day when the Lord shall rise out of His place to punish the world for their iniquity, when the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. This entire discourse was given, not for the disciples only, but for those who should live in the last scenes of this earth's history."—"Desire of Ages," page 628.

3. "Turning to the disciples, Christ said, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.' Many false messiahs will appear, claiming to work miracles, and declaring that the time of the deliverance of the Jewish nation has come. These will mislead many. Christ's words were fulfilled. Between His death and the siege of Jerusalem many false messiahs appeared. But this warning was given also to those who live in this age of the world. The same deceptions practised prior to the destruction of Jerusalem have been practised through the ages, and will be practised again."—"Desire of Ages," page 628.
