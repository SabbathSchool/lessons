## Notes

1. "The Jews had always regarded the vine as the most noble of plants, and a type of all that was powerful, excellent, and fruitful." "Jesus and the disciples were on the way to Gethsemane... The moon is shining bright, and reveals to Him a flourishing grape-vine. Drawing the attention of the disciples to it, He employs it as a symbol."—"Desire of Ages," pages 674, 675. Isa. 5:1-7.

"What a beautiful and appropriate type does the vine afford of the mystical body of Christ... Christ is not the trunk, nor the branches, but the whole vine; they are members of His body, of His flesh, of His bones [Col. 2:17, 19]."— Peloubet's Notes.

2. "'He taketh away.' Because their presence injures the other branches; and their remaining is of no benefit to themselves. As long as there is hope of their bearing fruit, they are permitted to remain, and are pruned and cared for. (See Luke 13:6-9). If this is of no avail, they are taken away, by the natural withering away of those who draw no nourishment from the true vine. They lose their interest, and practically sever their connection with Christ and His church."—Peloubet's Notes. Jude 12.

3. "'That My joy:' The same kind of joy that I have, and to be obtained in the same way. This joy is (1) the joy of a free activity in doing right, like the joy of motion in health, like the song of a bird in the morning. (2) The joy of entire consecration and submission to God. (3) The joy of doing good, of self-denial for others. (4) The joy of perfect faith in a wise and loving God, committing everything to His care. (5) Joy in the conscious love of God to us, communion and friendship with Him. (6) The joy of loving others. (7) The joy of seeing others saved. (8) The joy of victory. (9) In the end, outward delights and pleasures to correspond with the inward joy."— Peloubet's Notes.
