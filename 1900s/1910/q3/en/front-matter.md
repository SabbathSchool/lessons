## Sabbath-School Lessons on the LIFE OF CHRIST

NOTE.- In the lessons for this quarter we shall study the closing scenes in Jesus' public ministry. Every act of Christ during this time, and especially His words to His disciples, contain lessons of deep significance to us who live in the last days of the gospel work upon the earth. Therefore each lesson should be studied very carefully. Jesus tore away the mask that the scribes and Pharisees used in hiding their deformities of character. He was well aware of what the result would be in thus bringing the truth to bear upon these hidden sins. "Satan's attacks against the advocates of the truth will wax more bitter and determined to the very close of time. As in Christ's day the chief priests and rulers stirred up the people against Him, so today the religious leaders will excite bitterness and prejudice against the truth for this time. The people will be led to acts of violence and opposition which they would never have thought of had they not been imbued with the animosity of professed Christians against the truth."â€”"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 69. Let us learn of Christ, by studying His methods and words during the last days of His ministry, that we may be prepared to meet the issues before us.
