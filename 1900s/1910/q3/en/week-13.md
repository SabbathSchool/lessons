## Notes

1. It is the Son of God addressing His Father and our Father (John 20:17). Divinity in humanity is pleading with divinity for humanity. No other such prayer can be found upon record. It is the out-breathing of divine love for God's own in a sinful world. Ponder the prayer. Become familiar with its words. Every sentence is full of divine meaning. Let it become Jesus' prayer for you. Peter and James and John and the other apostles are dead. But the prayer is still for those who are "in the world" but "are not of the world." Hence, it is for us (John 17:20).

2. "When the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ ascended on high, refusing the adoration of angels until He had presented the request, 'I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am' (John 17:24). Then with inexpressible love and power came forth the answer from the Father's throne, 'Let all the angels of God worship Him.' Not a stain rested upon Jesus. His humiliation ended, His sacrifice completed, there was given unto Him a name that is above every name."—"Great Controversy," page 502.
