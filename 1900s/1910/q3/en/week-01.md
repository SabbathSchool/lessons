## Notes

1. Before entering upon the woes pronounced upon the Pharisees, a brief review of their characteristics may be in place.

"The Pharisees were the most numerous and wealthy sect of the Jews... Their leading tenets were the following: that the world was governed by fate, or by a fixed decree of God; that the souls of men were immortal, and were either eternally happy or miserable beyond the grave; that the dead would be raised; that there were angels, good and bad... Some of the laws of Moses they maintained very strictly. In addition to the written laws, they held to a multitude which they maintained had come down from Moses by tradition. These they felt themselves as much bound to observe as the written law. Under the influence of these laws they washed themselves before meals with great scrupulousness; they fasted twice a week — on Thursday, when they supposed Moses ascended Mount Sinai, and on Monday, when he descended... They were in general a corrupt, hypocritical, office-seeking, haughty class of men."—Barnes's Notes, volume 1, pages 50, 51.

2. Christ took the place of a servant. Greatness in the estimate of heaven consists in the service rendered others. Greatness as viewed among men consists in being served. Christ here lays down the eternal principle that must govern every subject of His kingdom — that of true humility manifested in helpful service for others. He who is constantly lifting self into prominence, is not following in the footsteps of his lowly Master. Luke 9:48.

3. Christ did not lessen man's obligation to faithfully pay tithe, even upon the little profits of the garden (Luke 16:10); but He wanted all to see how it is possible to neglect the great principles of judgment, mercy, and faith, in stickling for little things. Neither tithe-paying nor the weightier matters are to be left undone. "Every church-member should feel under obligation to consecrate his tithe to God. None are to follow the sight of their eyes, or the inclination of their selfish hearts, and thus rob God... The requirement is, 'Honor the Lord with thy substance.' The tendency to covetousness must be constantly restrained, else it will eat into the hearts of men and women, and they will run greedily after gain."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, page 481.

4. Christ makes it plain to all the people that He is not to be associated in their minds in any way with the wicked practices of the Pharisees. They had sinned against great light. Jesus was about to leave them forever. He gave them to understand that unless they repented of their sins, they could have no share in the kingdom of God.

5. "Divine pity marked the countenance of the Son of God as He cast one lingering look upon the temple and then upon His hearers. In a voice choked by deep anguish of heart and bitter tears He exclaimed, 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!' This is the separation struggle. In the lamentation of Christ the very heart of God is pouring itself forth. It is the mysterious farewell of the long-suffering love of the Deity."—"Desire of Ages," page 620.
