## Notes

1. "It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished in this life. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty of some wrong-doing, either of the sufferer himself or of his parents. It is true that all suffering results from the transgression of God's law, but this truth had become perverted. Satan, the author of sin and all its results, had led men to look upon disease and death as proceeding from God,— as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on account of sin. Hence one upon whom some great affliction or calamity had fallen, had the additional burden of being regarded as a great sinner." — "Desire of Ages," pages 470, 471.

2. "While Jesus corrected their error, He did not explain the cause of the man's affliction, but told them what would be the results." — Id., page 471.

"Thus He transferred the question from intellectual ground to that of the moral purpose which suffering might serve." — Edersheim: "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," Vol. 2, page 180.

3. The wickedness of such a charge seems marvelous, yet such is the blindness of those who have rejected light. They were very zealous for what they conceived as the proper observance of the Sabbath, yet were planning murder on that very day. They had abundant ground for a charge against Him according to their man-made laws. The making of clay, or the application of a remedy where life or an organ was not in danger, was considered as Sabbath-breaking. The application of saliva to the eye was expressly forbidden. (Edersheim.)

4. "Talmudic writings speak of two, or rather, we should say, of three, kinds of excommunication,' of which the two first were chiefly disciplinary, while the third was the real 'casting out,' 'unsynagoging,' 'cutting off from the congregation.' . . . The first and lightest degree was . . . properly 'a rebuke,' an inveighing. Ordinarily, its duration extended over seven days; but if pronounced by the nasi, or head of the Sanhedrin, it lasted for thirty days. . . . The second degree of Jewish excommunication, the so-called niddui, . . . lasted for thirty days at the least, although among Babylonians only for seven days. At the end of that term there was 'a second admonition,' which lasted other thirty days. If still unrepentant, the third or real excommunication was pronounced, which was called the cherem, or ban, and of which the duration was indefinite. Any three persons, or even one duly authorized, could pronounce the lowest sentence. The greater excommunication (niddui) — which, happily, could only be pronounced in an assembly of ten — must have been terrible, being accompanied by curses, and, at a later period, sometimes proclaimed with the blast of the horn. . . . Still more terrible was the final excommunication, or cherem, when a ban of indefinite duration was laid on a man. Henceforth he was like one dead. He was not allowed to study with others, no intercourse was to be held with him, he was not even to be shown the road. He might, indeed, buy the necessaries of life, but it was forbidden to eat or drink with such an one." — Edersheim: "Life and Times of Jesus," Vol. 2, pages 183, 184.

5. "The man was made of sturdier stuff than his parents. He was not to be overawed by their authority, or knocked down by their assertions. . . . 'We know,' the Pharisees had said, 'that this man is a sinner.' 'Whether He is a sinner,' the man replied, 'I do not know; one thing I do know, that being blind, now I see.' Then they began again their weary and futile cross-examination. 'What did He do to thee? How did He open thine eyes?' But the man had had enough of this. 'I told you once, and ye did not attend. Why do ye wish to hear again? Is it possible that ye too wish to be His disciples?' Bold irony this — to ask these stately, ruffled, scrupulous Sanhedrists, whether he was really to regard them as anxious and sincere inquirers about the claims of the Nazarene Prophet! Clearly here was a man whose presumptuous honesty would neither be bullied into suppression nor corrupted into a lie. He was quite impracticable. So, since authority, threats, blandishments, had all failed, they broke into abuse. 'Thou art His disciple: we are the disciples of Moses; of this man we know nothing.' 'Strange,' he replies, 'that you should know nothing of a man who yet has wrought a miracle such as not even Moses ever wrought; and we know that neither He nor any one else could have done it, unless He were from God.' Unable to control any longer their transport of indignation, they flung him out of the hall, and out of the synagogue." — Farrar: "Life of Christ," chapter 41, pages 422.

6. "If sifting the evidence for a miracle, stating every possible objection to it, discussing publicly, not centuries afterwards, but at the time and on the spot, the whole details, turning the occurrence out and in, back and forth, exhausting every effort to shake its validity, and then finding that it has been a veritable work above the ordinary processes of nature and beyond the powers of men — if such cross-examination should seem to any one essential to his believing in the historicity of the miracles,— in this instance it actually took place, and we have the circumstantial record of it in this chapter.

"This treatment is entirely exceptional in the miracle-narratives; but on that account this single specimen has all the greater apologetic value. It can no more be said that the difficulties of the modern mind are wholly disregarded in the Gospels. Here is precisely that argumentative handling of the various difficulties about a miracle with which we are so familiar. The occurrence is related. Then arise the questions upon it: Was there really anything unusual done? How was it done? Who was the doer of it? Was the doing of it a mark of divine commission and authority? Who and what shall we conclude the worker of it to be? These and such as these are the questions which every age — our own pre-eminently — has asked about the miracles of Jesus. They are asked and answered, in this instance, in presence of the facts themselves." — Laidlaw: "Miracles of Our Lord," pages 289, 290.
