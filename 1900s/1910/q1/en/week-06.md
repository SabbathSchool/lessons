## Notes

1. Not only is Jesus a door or entrance to life and safety, but the only one. All those who at any time teach any other way than the merits of Christ for salvation, whether they be Jewish leaders, heathen philosophers, or professed Christian teachers, are thieves and robbers; "for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." See "Desire of Ages," page 478.

2. "'In Him was life.' He came that sinners under sentence of death might have life. And the life which He gives is a more abundant life. Instead of a few short years of time, He gives ages of eternity. But the abundance of life is not merely in duration. The touch of God's Spirit intensifies life, and gives it a larger meaning, with new purposes and ambitions. Children of God have a new interest in the world of humanity as the purchased possession of Christ. The new life must be a fuller one, a deeper one than the old, giving birth to thoughts more grave, feelings more deep,-- in a word, 'life more abundant.'" — Dykes: "Christian World Pulpit," Vol. 14, page 177.

3. What a precious lesson is this parable, or allegory, setting forth so clearly the mission of Christ, and the intimate relation existing between Him and His people. To get the force of the illustration, we should understand shepherd life in the East.

"As we sat and looked, almost spellbound, the silent hillsides around us were in a moment filled with life and sound. The shepherds led their flocks forth from the gates of the city. They were in full view, and we watched them and listened to them with no little interest. Thousands of sheep and goats were there, grouped in dense, confused masses. The shepherds stood together until all came out. Then they separated, each shepherd taking a different path, and uttering, as he advanced, a shrill, peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed and moved, as if shaken by some internal convulsion; then points struck out in the direction taken by the shepherds; these became longer and longer, until the confused masses were resolved into long, living streams, flowing after their leaders. Such a sight was not new to me, still it had lost none of its interest. It was, perhaps, one of the most vivid illustrations which human eyes could witness of that beautiful discourse of our Lord recorded by John." — Porter, in "Bible Student's Manual," page 160.

4. "'Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again.' That is, My Father has so loved you, that He even loves Me more for giving My life to redeem you. In becoming your substitute and surety, by surrendering My life, by taking your liabilities, your transgressions, I am endeared to My Father. . . . While as a member of the human family He was mortal, as God He was the fountain of life for the world. He could have withstood the advances of death, and refused to come under its dominion; but voluntarily He laid down His life, that He might bring life and immortality to light. He bore the sin of the world, endured its curse, yielded up His life as a sacrifice, that men might not eternally die." — "Desire of Ages," pages 483, 484.
