## Notes

1. "In the center of the Court of the Women, at the Feast of Tabernacles, two tall stands were placed, each supporting four large branching candelabra. After the evening sacrifice, all the lights in these candelabra were kindled, the flame broad and brilliant enough to illuminate the whole city, to remind the people of the pillar of light by which their marchings through the wilderness were guided. And still freer and heartier than the morning jubilations which attended on the libation of the water, were the evening ones, which accompanied the kindling of the lights." — Hanna: "Life of Christ," page 373.

2. How forcibly are we reminded that "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not." All through Jesus' life, the Father had borne witness to His Son. The visit of the wise men when Jesus was born, the incident at Jerusalem when He was twelve years old, the powerful testimony of John, Jesus' teaching and miraculous works, all bore unmistakable testimony to His divinity. Aside from this, the Father had spoken from heaven in testimony to His sonship.
