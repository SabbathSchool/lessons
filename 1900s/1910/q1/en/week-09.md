## Notes

1. How prone man is to trust in uncertain riches (1 Tim. 6:17), and selfishly to hoard God's gifts which were meant to be used to bless humanity and for the glory of God. But "to live for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire of benefit for self's sake, cuts the soul off from life. It is the spirit of Satan to get, to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sacrifice self for the good of others." "Christ's Object Lessons," page 259.

It is not a sin to have worldly possessions. The Lord expects us to be diligent and economical in our business affairs (Rom. 12:11; Prov. 10:4; 27:23), that we may have wherewith to help the needy and support the Gospel. Eph. 4:28. The use we make of our means, in this selfish, grasping age, is a good index to our Christian experience.

2. As many prophets and kings had desired to witness the events connected with Jesus' first coming (Luke 10:24), so the prophets have spoken of and looked forward to the consummation of the Christian's hope (Acts 3:21) at His second coming. We are living in the last generation, with the light of all generations focused upon our pathway. To us much has been given, and of us much will be required.

"The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for service. The unused capabilities are as much brought into account as are these that are improved. For all that we might become through the right use of our talents God holds us responsible. We shall be judged according to what we ought to have done, but did not accomplish because we did not use our powers to glorify God." — "Christ's Object Lessons," page 363.
