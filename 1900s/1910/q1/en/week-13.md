## Notes

1. "What hatred can that be, except the hatred of all that stands in the way of and gainsays discipleship, whether it be found in father or mother, in wife or child, in brother or sister, nay, in one's own life even? It is the hatred of all that opposes itself to the love of Christ, to the image and Spirit of Christ; real hatred of what is really hateful, in spite of its being found in the dearest of our fellow creatures or in our own beloved life. We must in no way seek to weaken this strong word, but only explain it. The disciples must be prepared to forsake those the most beloved, if Christ calls." — Lange: "Life of Christ," Vol. 2, pages 424, 425.

The word "hate" in the text had the meaning at that time of "love less, or hold in less esteem." See Matt. 10:37; Gen. 39:30, 31.

2. The cost is to be counted on both sides. It costs something to be a Christian, but it costs more not to be one.

3. This verse is translated by Rotherham as follows: "In this way, then, every one from among you who is not bidding adieu to all his goods, can not be My disciple."

4. "The lost sheep knows that it is lost. It has left the shepherd and the flock, and it can not recover itself. It represents those who realize that they are separated from God, and who are in a cloud of perplexity, in humiliation, and sorely tempted. The lost coin represents those who are lost in trespasses and sins, but who have no sense of their condition. They are estranged from God, and they know it not. Their souls are in peril, but they are unconscious and unconcerned. In this parable Christ teaches that even those who are indifferent to the claims of God, are the object of His pitying love. They are to be sought for, that they may be brought back to God.

"The sheep wandered away from the fold; it was lost in the wilderness or upon the mountains. The piece of silver was lost in the house. It was close at hand, yet it could be recovered only by diligent search." — "Christ's Object Lessons," page 194.
