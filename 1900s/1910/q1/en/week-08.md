## Notes

1. "He exposed the mere externalism of the Pharisaic law of purification, to the utter ignoring of the higher need of inward purity, which lay at the foundation of all." — Edersheim: "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," page 211.

2. "The three distinctions of a Pharisee were: not to make use nor to partake of anything that had not been tithed; to observe the laws of purification; and, as a consequence of these two, to abstain from familiar intercourse with all non-Pharisees. This separation formed the ground of their claim to distinction. It will be noticed that it is exactly to these three things our Lord adverts: so that these sayings of His are not, as might seem, unconnected, but in the strictest internal relationship. Our Lord shows how Pharisaism, as regarded the outer, was connected with the opposite tendency, as regarded the inner man: outward purification, with ignorance of the need of that inward purity which consisted in God-consecration, and with the neglect of it; strictness of outward tithing, with ignorance and neglect of the principle which underlay it, viz., the acknowledgment of God's right over mind and heart (judgment and love of God); while, lastly, the Pharisaic pretense of separation, and consequent claim to distinction, issued only in pride and self-assertion. Thus, tried by its own tests, Pharisaism terribly failed." — Id. page 212.

3. The lawyers were the professional interpreters of the Jewish law. As Geikie says, they sat in their chambers and schools, creating "legal rules, endless, harassing, intolerable for the people, but not affecting themselves, shut out as they were from busy life." — "Life and Words of Christ," Vol. 2, page 141.

4. By building these tombs they pretended to honor the martyred prophets, thus gaining popularity; but their actions show them to possess the same spirit as that which led their fathers to kill the prophets.

5. Hypocrisy is one of the worst forms of evil. "All shams are hateful, but a religious sham is worst of all." — Abbott. Admitted into the life it will corrupt the whole nature, just as it had pervaded all Pharisaism.

"The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's glory is the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the effectual working of the Spirit can implant this motive. Only the power of God can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy. This change is the sign of His working. When the faith we accept destroys selfishness and pretense, when it leads us to seek God's glory and not our own, we may know that it is of the right order." — "Desire of Ages," page 409.

6. "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." John 1:9. "All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out." John 6:37.

"But it is possible to drive the Spirit from us so that its pleading voice can not be heard. Today if ye will hear His voice harden not your hearts,' for 'the sin against the Holy Spirit is the sin of persistent refusal to respond to the invitation to repent?'" — Mrs. E. G. White, in "Review and Herald," June 29, 1897.
