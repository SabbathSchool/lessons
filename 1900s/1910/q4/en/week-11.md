## Notes

1. The name "Emmaus" means "warm springs." It was a little town about seven and one half miles from Jerusalem. Its location is not now identified with certainty. It was doubtless in the afternoon when the disciples left Jerusalem, for the day was far spent when they reached Emmaus. These two disciples were not of the twelve, but of "the rest." Luke 24:9.

2. "But their eyes were holden," with disappointed hopes, and sad and troubled at the perplexing tidings they had received concerning the empty tomb and the absent body. So in our perplexity and trials the blessed Master is near to us, but our eyes are often holden through unbelief, and we do not behold Him.

3. They rehearsed the events of the last three days, the betrayal and trials of Jesus, their own disappointment, the visit to the sepulcher, the half-believed story of His resurrection. Note that of the three days in which all these things happened this is "the third day," thus showing how elastic is the term over which many are led into controversy. The three days so often mentioned in connection with the Saviour's sufferings include parts of two days and the whole of one.

4. Jesus might have easily convinced them of His resurrection by showing them His wounded hands, or revealing His power in some supernatural way. But He desired that their belief in Him should rest, not on sight, or some miraculous revelation, but on the Scriptures. In like manner He desires that we believe in Him, not because we see some miracles performed, but on the plain statement of the Scriptures themselves.

5. Do we desire the Lord's presence sufficiently, to urge that He abide with us? We often urge the coming or tarrying of a friend. Would not Christ be oftener our companion in the common things of life if we but urged or "constrained" Him more?
