## Notes

1. "The evangelists differ in the account of this title. Mark (15:26) says it was 'The King of the Jews.' Luke (23:38), 'This is the King of the Jews.' John (19:19), 'Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.' But the difficulty may be easily removed. John says that the title was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. It is not at all improbable that the inscription varied in these languages. One evangelist may have translated it from the Hebrew, another from the Greek, a third from the Latin, and a fourth may have translated one of the inscriptions a little differently from another. Besides, the evangelists all agree in the main point of the inscription; viz., that He was the King of the Jews." — Barnes's Notes on Matthew 27.

2. "It is left for the reader to determine whether the words 'this day' should be joined (A) with the former part of the sentence, or (B) with the latter. In favor of (A) may be urged (1) the fact that semeron, 'this day,' does not always stand first in the clause to which it belongs (see Luke 2:11; 5:26; 22:34; Acts 20:26; 22:3; 24:21; 26:29); (2) that being essentially a demonstrative word, it will bear any reasonable stress which may be laid upon it, whether it be placed before or after the words which it qualifies; (3) that it is far from meaningless if regarded as belonging to the opening words of asseveration ('Thou dost ask to be remembered then; verily thou art assured now. As on this the day of My weakness and shame, thou hast faith to ask, I this day have authority to answer'); (4) that the latter part of the verse is thus left free to refer to the very matter of the suppliant's request ('Thou dost ask to be remembered when I come in My kingdom: thou shalt be in My kingdom; shalt be with Me in the very Paradise of My kingdom, in the garden of the Lord — Isa. 51:3 [Sept., paradeisos]; Eze. 36:35; compare Gen. 2:8 [Sept., paradeisos]; Gen. 3:2 [Sept., paradeisos]; Rev. 2:7 — in that most central and blessed part of the coming kingdom, of which thou dost believe Me to be the destined king.')." — Rotherham's Translation, note on Luke 23:43.
