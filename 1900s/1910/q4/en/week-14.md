## Notes

1. The tree of knowledge of good and evil placed in the midst of the Garden of Eden tested man's loyalty, as well as constantly reminding him that his home was his only as a gift from his Maker. That one tree would stand as a silent witness to man that the supreme ownership or title of the world was held by his God, yet so long as he proved loyal to the government of heaven, the home was his.

"At the very beginning of man's existence a check was placed upon the desire for self-indulgence, the fatal passion that lay at the foundation of Satan's fall. The tree of knowledge, which stood near the tree of life in the midst of the garden, was to be a test of the obedience, faith, and love of our first parents." "While they remained true to God, Adam and his companion were to bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control was given them over every living thing." — "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 48-50.

2. All about us we see the results of our first parents' sin in disregarding God's ownership and command concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil placed in the midst of the Garden of Eden. The terrible crimes committed and the universal reign of disease and death constantly remind us of the truthfulness of God's words to Adam as to what should result from his disobedience.

3. "Every Christian is a steward of God, entrusted with His goods. Remember the words, 'Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.' 1 Cor. 4:2. Let us be sure that we are not robbing God in any jots and tittles; for much is involved in this question. All things belong to God. Man may ignore His claims. While He bountifully bestows His blessings upon them, they may use His gifts for their own selfish gratification, but they will be called to give an account of their stewardship." — "Testimonies," volume 9, page 246.

"My brethren, the money that you use to buy and sell and get gain will be a curse to you if you withhold from the Lord that which is His. The means entrusted to you for the advancement of the Lord's work should be used in sending the gospel to all parts of the world." — Id., page 53.
