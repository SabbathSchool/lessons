## Notes

1. The Herod here mentioned was Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was own brother to Archelaus. His tetrarchy extended over Galilee and Perea. He was wholly unprincipled, and became worse after he slew John the Baptist. He had come down to Jerusalem to attend the Passover. Grotius declares that it was the custom of the Romans to send a criminal to the ruler or judge of the district where his crime had been committed, and Pilate seized upon this practice as an easy way out of a troublesome duty.

2. The enmity between Pilate and Herod may be explained by reference to Luke 13:1. It is generally supposed that Pilate had incurred the enmity of Herod by his jurisdiction in the slaying of the Galileans. This he acknowledged by sending Jesus to Herod, and Herod shows his reconciliation by sending Jesus back to Pilate. This is neither the first nor the last time that the agencies of evil have united to suppress or destroy the truth.

3. This is the third time, twice by Pilate and once by Herod, that Jesus has been pronounced guiltless. This position the Roman governor should have steadfastly maintained. But Pilate was an unprincipled time-server, willing to sacrifice principle to be popular. His next step was a compromise.

4. Though one reads the story a hundred times, he longs each time that Pilate would prove true to his convictions and release Jesus. But each time he fails, each time yields a little more of truth and right, and entangles himself more securely in Satan's web. What a lesson this ought to be to each one of us!

5. "The Jews were accustomed to wash their hands when they wished to show that they were innocent of a crime committed by others. See Deut. 21:6; Ps. 26:6. Pilate, in doing this, meant to denote that they were guilty of His death, but that he was innocent." — Barnes's Notes.

No one can lay the responsibility of his actions upon others. Pilate could not wash his hands of the evil deed. He himself said to Jesus, "I have power to crucify Thee, and I have power to release Thee."

6. "Some thirty years later, and on that very spot, was judgment pronounced against some of the best in Jerusalem; and among the 3,600 victims of the governor's fury, of whom not a few were scourged and crucified right over against the pretorium, were many of the noblest of the citizens of Jerusalem. A few years more, and hundreds of crosses bore Jewish mangled bodies within sight of Jerusalem." — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 578.
