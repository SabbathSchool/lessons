## Notes

1. "He goeth before you." It is not in past traditions, however holy; it is not in past conceptions of truth, however much they may have been blessed; it is not in dead creeds written by men, however good; it is not in plans once successful, that our success lies; it is in following the present living Christ in His work today, out into the great field where the need lies.

"Tell His disciples and Peter." Poor, discouraged, repentant Peter. He is not forgotten by his Lord. The last time he had seen Him was after his threefold denial. Now when risen from the dead Jesus remembers His sorrowing disciple, and fearing he will in his despondency conclude the Master does not care for him, He asks that Peter especially be told that He is risen from the dead. We have the same loving, compassionate Saviour today.

2. Seeth the napkin "wrapped together in a place by itself." God is a God of system and order — no disorder seen even in the grave, no haste displayed in leaving the tomb. In that napkin wrapped up and placed by itself is given the lie to the tale told by the soldiers that while they slept the disciples stole away His body. Had thieves disturbed the tomb they would not have waited to place things in order.

3. The individual characteristics of Peter and John are seen in their visit to the tomb. Peter, rash and impetuous, went into the tomb as soon as he reached it. John, more cautious and deliberate, first looked in, going in later.

4. After visiting the sepulcher the disciples went to their home. Not so with Mary. She could not go home. She had lost her Lord, and could not rest till she had found Him. She remains by the sepulcher to weep. It is always to such anxious souls that the Lord appears. While weeping her Lord appears with words of comfort. She was the first to greet Him when risen from the dead.
