## Notes

1. Over the dark Kidron passed David in sorrow and agony in his flight from Jerusalem a thousand years before; over the Kidron to His awful agony for a lost world passed David's Son, the promised Seed. Gethsemane was an enclosure at the foot of the Mount of Olives. Here our Lord was accustomed to go with His disciples for prayer and instruction. Little did they realize the meaning of this last journey across the historic brook.

2. "The sorrow that came upon Him was so overwhelming and crushing that it pressed Him down to the earth, and penetrated soul and body with insupportable anguish." — Daniel March, "Night Scenes of the Bible." See Isa. 53:10, 12.

3. The humanity of our Lord shrank from the awful agony before Him; not the physical suffering alone; not the mocking, the shame, the anguish; but from the awful sense of sin which hid the Father's face, and weighed upon the Son of Man like the agony of a lost soul. No wonder He prayed that if possible the cup be removed. God did not condemn Him for that. He does not condemn us when we, in human weakness, pray for deliverance from some awful trial. God pities and loves us still; for "He knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust." He loved not less His Son in dark Gethsemane than on the shining Mount of Transfiguration.

4. It was only a little while before this that Peter had avowed himself ready to go with Jesus to prison or to death; now he could not watch with his Lord one short hour. Have we in our experience done better?

5. The angel could not lessen the load, could not take the burden upon the Saviour's heart, could not bear the cross, though he would willingly have done so; but he brought strengthening grace and cheer from the Throne. Even so with us. For our own good there may be burdens, heavy to bear, laid upon us, that we may draw needed strength from the infinite Source.

6. "The hour is come." The long delayed hour had come, the crisis of the world, when divinity, compassed about with the infirmities of humanity, met its supreme test. The Saviour had anticipated the struggle before; He had talked of it with Moses and Elijah; He had poured out His soul in prayer during entire night seasons concerning it; now the reality had come.

"Yet a third time He left them to pray as before. And now He returned victorious. After three assaults had the tempter left Him in the wilderness; after the threefold conflict in the garden he was vanquished. Christ came forth triumphant. No longer did He bid His disciples watch. They might, nay, they should, sleep and take rest, ere the near terrible events of His betrayal — for, the hour had come when the Son of Man was to be betrayed into the hands of sinners." — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 541.
