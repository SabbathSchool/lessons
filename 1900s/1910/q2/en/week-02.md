## Notes

1. "Of the three terms in common use among the Jews to express the future state of blessedness-(1) the Garden of Eden, or Paradise; (2) the Throne of Glory; (3) the Bosom of Abraham — this was the most widely popular. It rested on the idea of a great feast, in which Abraham was the host. To lie in his bosom, as St. John in that of our Lord (John 13:23), was to be there as the most favored guest. And this was the position which was assigned to the beggar, obviously not merely as a compensation for the 'evil things' he had endured on earth, but as the crown of the faith and patience with which he had borne them."—Plumptre.

2. The "good things" the rich man had chosen as his were the pleasures of sense, casting aside all responsibility for his fellow men.

3. "In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Christ shows that in this life men decide their eternal destiny. During probationary time the grace of God is offered to every soul. But if men waste their opportunities in self-pleasing, they cut themselves off from everlasting life. No after-probation will be granted them. By their own choice they have fixed an impassable gulf between them and their God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 260.

4. There is in this request an implied claim that he had not been fully warned of the results of his course of life.

5. "And what may be called the epilogue of this parable contains a lesson more solemn still; namely, that the means of grace which God's mercy accords to every living soul are ample for its enlightenment and deliverance; that if these be neglected, no miracle will be wrought to startle the absorbed soul from its worldly interests."— Farrar's "Life of Christ," chapter 44.

6. Great care should be exercised not to strain the interpretation of the parables by endeavoring to make some application to every detail. "In this parable Christ was meeting the people on their own ground. The doctrine of a conscious state of existence between death and the resurrection was held by many of those who were listening to Christ's words. The Saviour knew of their ideas, and He framed His parable so as to inculcate important truths through these preconceived opinions. He held up before His hearers a mirror wherein they might see themselves in their true relation to God. He used the prevailing opinion to convey the idea He wished to make prominent to all,— that no man is valued for his possessions; for all he has belongs to him only as lent by the Lord. A misuse of these gifts will place him below the poorest and most afflicted man who loves God and trusts in Him."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 265.

7. "Cause one of these little ones to stumble." R.V. Not only are we responsible for the salvation or loss of our own souls, but for the influence we exert on others. "Let us remember that a Christlike life is the most powerful argument that can be advanced in favor of Christianity, and that a cheap Christian character works more harm in the world than the character of a worldling."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 21.
