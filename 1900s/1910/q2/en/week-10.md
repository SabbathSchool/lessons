## Notes

1. "It was not the season for ripe figs, except in certain localities; and on the highlands about Jerusalem it might truly be said, 'The time of figs was not yet.' But in the orchard to which Jesus came, one tree appeared to be in advance of all the others. It was already covered with leaves. It is the nature of the fig-tree that before the leaves open, the growing fruit appears. Therefore this tree in full leaf gave promise of well-developed fruit. But its appearance was deceptive. Upon searching its branches, from the lowest bough to the topmost twig, Jesus found 'nothing but leaves.' It was a mass of pretentious foliage, nothing more."—"Desire of Ages," page 581.

2. "The cursing of the fig-tree was an acted parable. That barren tree, flaunting its pretentious foliage in the very face of Christ, was a symbol of the Jewish nation. The Saviour desired to make plain to His disciples the cause and the certainty of Israel's doom. For this purpose He invested the tree with moral qualities, and made it the expositor of divine truth. The Jews stood forth distinct from all other nations, professing allegiance to God. They had been specially favored by Him, and they laid claim to righteousness above every other people. But they were corrupted by the love of the world and the greed of gain. They boasted of their knowledge, but they were ignorant of the requirements of God, and were full of hypocrisy. Like the barren tree, they spread their pretentious branches aloft, luxuriant in appearance, and beautiful to the eye, but they yielded 'nothing but leaves.' The Jewish religion, with its magnificent temple, its sacred altars, its mitered priests and impressive ceremonies, was indeed fair in outward appearance, but humility, love, and benevolence were lacking. . . . Had they [Israel] kept the law of God, they would have done the same unselfish work that Christ did. But love to God and man was eclipsed by pride and self-sufficiency. They brought ruin upon themselves by refusing to minister to others. The treasures of truth which God had committed to them, they did not give to the world. In the barren tree they might read both their sin and its punishment."—"Desire of Ages," page 582, 583.

3. This was the last great day of Jesus' teaching, a memorable day indeed in His life. Here "the young Galilean bearing no earthly honor or royal badge" met "the Jewish authorities arrayed in all the pomp of official costume." There was prolonged controversy over puzzling questions designed to bring Him into popular disfavor. Hour by hour He successfully met their attack, and carrying the war into their own territory, "He silenced them, but their hearts would not yield." Then letting loose the storm of His righteous indignation upon them, "He exposed their hypocritical practises in sentences that fell like strokes of lightning, and made them a scorn and laughing-stock, not only to the hearers then, but to all the world since."— Stalker. It was a last mighty effort to show them their inward selves and lead them to repent, and to place the truth clearly before their followers. On the light side of the picture is the self-sacrificing widow to whom Jesus called attention, and the request to see Jesus by certain Greeks (proselytes to the Jewish religion) in whom He saw a pledge of the results of an ingathering from the Gentile world.

4. "Scribes, priests, and rulers were all silenced. Baffled and disappointed, they stood with lowering brows, not daring to press further questions upon Christ. By their cowardice and indecision they had in a great measure forfeited the respect of the people, who now stood by, amused to see these proud, self-righteous men defeated. . . . Many of those who had anxiously awaited the result of the questioning of Jesus, were finally to become His disciples, first drawn toward Him by His words on that eventful day. . . . Many of those who witnessed the words and deeds of Jesus in the temple, from that time enshrined Him in their hearts as a prophet of God. . . . But as the popular feeling turned in His favor, the hatred of the priests toward Jesus increased. The wisdom by which He escaped the snares set for His feet, being a new evidence of His divinity, added fuel to their wrath."—"Desire of Ages," pages 594, 595.
