## Notes

1. "It is still customary in the East not only to give an invitation some time beforehand, but to send round servants at the proper time to inform the invited guests that all things are ready."— Kitto. This invitation was given to the Jewish people by Christ and His apostles.

2. After the work of Christ was completed, still another earnest effort was made for the Jewish people; but as a nation they spurned the Gospel message.

3. This evidently refers to the terrible retribution which came upon Jerusalem and the Jewish people in A.D. 70. The lesson, too, is for all time.

4. "The third call to the feast represents the giving of the Gospel to the Gentiles."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 309. Good and bad are invited. None are so good that they do not need Christ, and none too bad to be received.

5. "When the king came in to view the guests, the real character of all was revealed. For every guest at the feast there had been provided a wedding-garment. This garment was a gift from the king. By wearing it the guests showed their respect for the giver of the feast. But one man was clothed in his common citizen-dress. He had refused to make the preparation required by the king. The garment provided for him at great cost he disdained to wear. Thus he insulted his lord. To the king's demand, 'How camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment?' he could answer nothing. He was self-condemned."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 309.

6. "Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided, can make us meet to appear in God's presence. This covering, the robe of His own righteousness, Christ will put upon every repenting, believing soul. 'I counsel thee,' He says, 'to buy of Me . . . white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.'"—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 311.

7. "The spies had expected Jesus to answer their question directly, in one way or the other. If He should say, It is unlawful to give tribute to Caesar, He would be reported to the Roman authorities and arrested for inciting rebellion. But in case He should pronounce it lawful to pay the tribute, they designed to accuse Him to the people as opposing the law of God. Now they felt themselves baffled and defeated. Their plans were disarranged. The summary manner in which their question had been settled left them nothing further to say."—"Desire of Ages," page 602.

In spite of their failure, it was declared a few days later at His trial that He forbade giving tribute to Caesar. Luke 23:2.
