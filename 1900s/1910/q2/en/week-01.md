# Lesson 1 — The Prodigal Son; The Unjust Steward

APRIL 2, 1910

## LESSON SCRIPTURE
Luke 15:11 to 16:18.

## LESSON HELPS
"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 198-211, 366-375; Sabbath School Worker.

## PLACE
Jesus was doubtless in Perea, the country east of the Jordan, when He gave the people much of the instruction covered in this series of lessons. The so-called "Perean ministry" is probably covered by Mark 10; Matt. 19:1 to 21:1; and Luke 9:51 to 19:28. During this time "He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51), but He came to the "coasts of Judea beyond Jordan" (Matt. 19:1; Mark 10:1). "A considerable part of the closing months of Christ's ministry was spent in Perea, the province on 'the farther side of Jordan' from Judea. Here the multitude thronged His steps, as in His early ministry in Galilee, and much of His former teaching was repeated."—"Desire of Ages," page 488.

## Notes

1. According to Jewish law, the elder son would receive a double and the younger a single portion of the father's property at his death. Deut. 21:17. "The latter then desired that his father, anticipating the division, should give him the equivalent of his portion in money, an arrangement in virtue of which the entire domain, on the father's death, would come to the elder."— Godet.

Unappreciative of his father's love, and restive under home discipline, he ungratefully requests his inheritance. What is the spiritual significance? "It is the expression of man's desire to be independent of God, to be a god to himself (Gen. 3:5), and to lay out his life according to his own will and for his own pleasure. It is man growing weary of living upon God and upon His fulness, and desiring to take the ordering of his life into his own hands, and believing that he can be a fountain of blessedness to himself. All the subsequent sins of the younger son are included in this one, as in their germ,— are but the unfolding of this the sin of sins."— Trench.

2. The boasted freedom of sin soon becomes abject slavery. The promises of sin vanish like the marvelous pictures on a soap-bubble. Following the fulness of sin comes the famine of soul. A life of sin is a wasted life: "Whatever the appearance may be, every life centered in self is squandered. Whoever attempts to live apart from God, is wasting his substance. He is squandering the precious years, squandering the powers of mind and heart and soul, and working to make himself bankrupt for eternity."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 200, 201.

3. The one who goes away from God is not in his right mind. The prodigal "came to himself," he came to see his serious mistake, and that his father's plan for him was best. He resolved to return. How the devil fights the making of this first resolution! The downward road is strewn with failures to resolve in the strength of the Lord, and broken resolutions.

4. The great sin of the younger son was scorn of his father's love. The elder brother was actuated by the same spirit, though manifested in a different way. He was self-righteous and was working for the benefits that would accrue to him. He misinterpreted his father's love, and was hard-hearted toward his brother. The father does not give him merited rebuke, but tenderly pleads with him, to show him his error.

5. "If Christians were as sagacious and persevering in using wealth to promote their welfare in the next world, as worldly men are in using it to promote their interests here, the kingdom of God would be more flourishing than it is. . . . It should be noticed that the steward provides for his future by means of goods which are not his own, but are merely entrusted to his care. The wealth out of which the Christian lays up treasure in heaven, is in like manner not his own, but is held in trust."—"International Critical Commentary," pages 380, 381.

6. "'Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness,' Christ says, 'that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles' [R. V.]. God and Christ and angels are all ministering to the afflicted, the suffering, and the sinful. Give yourself to God for this work, use His gifts for this purpose, and you enter into partnership with heavenly beings. Your heart will throb in sympathy with theirs. You will be assimilated to them in character. To you these dwellers in the eternal tabernacles will not be strangers. When earthly things shall have passed away, the watchers at heaven's gates will bid you welcome."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 373.

And these gifts may be "of money, of knowledge, of strength, or opportunities, which to many have and to all may so easily become that 'of unrighteousness.'"
