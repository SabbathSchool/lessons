## Notes

1. The taxes imposed on subject nations by Rome were farmed out to wealthy men who would pay a definite sum for the privilege of collecting them. These men would sub-contract the work to tax-gatherers in the same way. The system was productive of a great deal of dishonesty and extortion. It is probable that Zaccheus had the contract to collect the customs at Jericho, and had tax-collectors, or publicans, working under him.

2. "Sycamore-tree. The Egyptian fig; a tree like the mulberry in appearance, size, and foliage, but belonging, generically, to the fig-trees. It grows to a great size and height"— Curry.

3. "When the rich young ruler had turned away from Jesus, the disciples had marveled at their Master's saying, 'How hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.' They had exclaimed one to another, 'Who then can be saved?' Now they had a demonstration of the truth of Christ's words, 'The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.' They saw how, through the grace of God, a rich man could enter the kingdom."—"Desire of Ages," page 555.

4. "No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation. The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the character and controls the conduct. Holiness is wholeness for God; it is the entire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling of the principles of heaven."—"Desire of Ages," page 555.

"Every converted soul will, like Zaccheus, signalize the entrance of Christ into his heart by an abandonment of the unrighteous practises that have marked his life. Like the chief publican, he will give proof of his sincerity by making restitution."—"Desire of Ages," page 556.

5. "The Christian in his business life is to represent to the world the manner in which our Lord would conduct business enterprises. In every transaction he is to make it manifest that God is his teacher. 'Holiness unto the Lord,' is to be written upon day-books and ledgers, on deeds, receipts, and bills of exchange. Those who profess to be followers of Christ, and who deal in an unrighteous manner, are bearing false witness against the character of a holy, just, and merciful God."—"Desire of Ages," page 556.

6. "Christ values acts of heartfelt courtesy. When any one did Him a favor, with heavenly politeness He blessed the actor. He did not refuse the simplest flower plucked by the hand of a child, and offered to Him in love. He accepted the offerings of children, and blessed the givers, inscribing their names in the Book of Life. . . . The desire that Mary had to do this service for her Lord was of more value to Christ than all the precious ointment in the world, because it expressed her appreciation of the world's Redeemer. It was the love of Christ that constrained her. The matchless excellence of the character of Christ filled her soul. That ointment was a symbol of the heart of the giver. It was the outward demonstration of a love fed by heavenly streams until it overflowed."—"Desire of Ages," page 564.

We may learn a lesson from Mary in expressing our love to those who need sympathy and help.

"How oft we, careless, wait till life's
Sweet opportunities are past,
And break our 'alabaster box
Of ointment' at the very last!
O, let us heed the living friend
Who walks with us life's common ways,
Watching our eyes for look of love,
And hungering for a word of praise!"
