## Notes

1. "Not a rebuke, nor a denial that Christ was good, but an attempt to lead the young man upward in his seeking to the only ideal of good, and only source of good. The young man used the common title of respect for a teacher; but Christ would ask him whether he looks upon Him merely as any other teacher; or does he recognize Him as a divine teacher,— the only one who is truly good; the 'good Master' who knows all things, and whose teaching is eternally true."—Peloubet's Notes. See also "Desire of Ages," page 518.

2. "What he lacked was earth's poverty and heaven's riches, a heart fully set on following Christ; and this could only come to him through willing surrender of all. And so this was to him alike the means, the test, and the need. To him it was this; to us it may be something quite other. Yet each of us has a lack — something quite deep down in our hearts which we may never yet have known, and which we must know and give up if we would follow Christ. And without forsaking, there can be no following. This is the law of the kingdom — and it is such because we are sinners, because sin is not only the loss of the good, but the possession of something else in its place."—"Edersheim: Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 341.

3. The exalted position and the possessions of this young man "were exerting a subtle influence for evil upon his character," which if cherished would supplant God in his affections. He discerned the issue. He wanted eternal life, yet he wanted his property and position more. He was unwilling to trust to God's direction; for withholding anything from God, shows that we do not really trust Him. Note how the young man Saul met and settled this same question. Phil. 3:6-9.

4. A hundredfold in value in the blessings received. "Even the young ruler would have received an hundredfold. Now his name is unknown, his influence unfelt. In a few years his possessions were ravaged by the Roman legions, while the disciples introduced a new and blessed kingdom on earth, whose influence is widening all down the ages. And in this he might have had a part, rejoicing in the triumph, and filled with immortal joy; and in the world to come life everlasting — the eternal life the young ruler wanted so much, but refused to accept"— Peloubet's Notes.

5. "Instruction has been given me that there is a withholding of the tithe that should be faithfully brought into the Lord's treasury for the support of ministers and missionaries who are opening the Scriptures to the people, and working from house to house. The work of evangelizing the world has been greatly hindered by personal selfishness. . . . Money is needed in order that the work done all over the world may be carried forward. Thousands upon thousands are perishing in sin, and a lack of means is hindering the proclamation of the truth that is to be carried to all nations and kindreds and tongues and people. There are men ready to go forth as the Lord's messengers, but because of a lack of means in the treasury they can not be sent to the places where the people are begging for some one to come and teach them the truth."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 52.

"The Lord desires His people to be thoughtful and caretaking. He desires them to practise economy in everything. If the workers in the mission fields could have the means that is used in expensive furnishings and in personal adornment, the triumphs of the cross of Christ would be greatly extended."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 54.

"Let there be systematic giving on the part of all. Some may be unable to give a large sum, but all can lay aside each week something for the Master. Let the children act their part. Let parents teach their children to save their pennies to give to the Lord. The gospel ministry is to be supported by self-denial and sacrifice. Through the self-denying efforts of God's people others will be brought into the faith, and these in turn will help to increase the offerings made for the carrying forward of the Lord's work."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 55.

6. "In the parable the first laborers agreed to work for a stipulated sum, and they received the amount specified, nothing more. Those later hired believed the master's promise, 'Whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.' They showed confidence in him by asking no question in regard to wages. They trusted to his justice and equity. They were rewarded, not according to the amount of their labor, but according to the generosity of his purpose."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 397.
