## Notes

1. Since the time of His rejection in Galilee, Jesus has been walking as it were in the shadow of the cross. During this time He endeavored to give the twelve a true understanding of the nature of His work on earth, and to prepare them for the great crisis. See Matt. 16:21; 17:22, 23. The instruction given at this time is more in detail than any given before.

2. The disciples knew well the dangers that threatened Jesus. On this account they had objected to His going to Judea at the time of the sickness of Lazarus, and at that time the Sanhedrin had again determined upon His death. Now His face is turned steadily toward Jerusalem again. Knowing these things, and thinking of a temporal kingdom and the twelve thrones which had recently been promised them, the apostles must have been very much troubled and confused in their minds.

3. "Our Lord means that such dignities as His disciples desired would not, and could not, be conferred in a capricious way by a mere act of the sovereign's pleasure. There could be no scope, in such high matters, for personal favoritism. It was in vain, therefore, for any to attempt to steal a march on their fellow servants. What they asked has been divinely prepared for those who are most worthy, those who have done most, and in heart and will sacrificed most, and suffered most. In the kingdom of heaven there is no chance of the highest posts and dignities being conferred on incompetent or inferior servants. The highest in excellence will be the highest in honor. It is for such, whether they be apostles, or ordinary preachers, or humble Sabbath-school teachers, whether they be crowned monarchs, or the lowliest of menials, that the highest places have been prepared by the Father in His all-embracing purpose and plan."— Peloubet's Notes.

4. "The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on earth has drank most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love."—"Desire of Ages," page 549. Here the spirit of the world and the spirit of Christ are clearly contrasted. The development of the Papacy, and nearly all the evils that have come into God's church, have been a result of disregarding this principle, the desire to be honored and to rule rather than to serve.

5. "I asked the angel why there was no more faith and power in Israel. Said he, 'Ye let go of the arm of the Lord too soon. Press your petitions to the throne, and hold on by strong faith. The promises are sure. Believe ye receive the things ye ask for, and ye shall have them.' I was then pointed to Elijah. He was subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly. His faith endured the trial. Seven times he prayed before the Lord, and at last the cloud was seen. I saw that we had doubted the sure promises, and wounded the Saviour by our lack of faith. Said the angel, 'Gird the armor about thee, and above all take the shield of faith; for that will guard the heart, the very life, from the fiery darts of the wicked.' If the enemy can lead the desponding to take their eyes off from Jesus, and look to themselves, and dwell upon their own unworthiness, instead of dwelling upon the worthiness of Jesus, His love, His merits, and His great mercy, he will get away their shield of faith, and gain his object; and they will be exposed to his fiery temptations. The weak should therefore look to Jesus, and believe in Him; they then exercise faith."—"Early Writings," pages 62, 63, old edition; page 73, new edition.
