## Notes

1. The Jews were looking for a temporal kingdom to be set up. But Jesus declared to them that "the kingdom of God cometh not with outward show" (margin); that the beginning of it was in the individual heart, and they should not look for its coming in the manifestations of earthly power. He said, "My kingdom is not of this world;" but the world-loving Jews and a world-loving church to-day would have it so. "To-day in the religious world there are multitudes who, as they believe, are working for the establishment of the kingdom of Christ as an earthly and temporal dominion. They desire to make our Lord the ruler of the kingdoms of this world, the ruler in its courts and camps, its legislative halls, its palaces and market-places. They expect Him to rule through legal enactments, enforced by human authority. Since Christ is not now here in person, they themselves will undertake to act in His stead, to execute the laws of His kingdom."—"Desire of Ages," page 509.

2. How slow is the comprehension of the human spirit! Blinded by preconceived opinion and Jewish prejudices, not even Jesus' disciples fully appreciated His character and mission. After the wonderful events of Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, and after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they realized what a wonderful privilege had been theirs, and they longed for His personal presence again.

3. Just as in His great prophecy, recorded in Matthew 24, Jesus seems here to blend the two great crises, the destruction of Jerusalem and His second coming. Compare Matt. 24:17; Mark 13:15.

"Remember Lot's wife." When Lot and his family were escaping from the doomed city, the solemn command was given to hasten, for the fiery storm would be delayed but little longer. But one of the fugitives ventured to cast a look backward to the doomed city, and she became a monument of God's judgment. If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angel's warning, but had earnestly fled toward the mountains, without one word of pleading or remonstrance, his wife also would have made her escape. The influence of his example would have saved her from the sin that sealed her doom. But his hesitancy and delay caused her to lightly regard the divine warning. While her body was upon the plain, her heart clung to Sodom, and she perished with it. She rebelled against God because His judgments involved her possessions and her children in the ruin. Although so greatly favored in being called out from the wicked city, she felt that she was severely dealt with, because the wealth that it had taken years to accumulate must be left to destruction. Instead of thankfully accepting deliverance, she presumptuously looked back to desire the life of those who had rejected the divine warning. Her sin showed her to be unworthy of life, for the preservation of which she felt so little gratitude."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 161, 162.

4. The judge is a very striking character. He is worse than a hypocrite. He is godless, and does not even care for public opinion. The helpless widow was seeking for justice. The word translated "avenge" means "to vindicate one's right," "to protect or defend one from another."

5. The setting chosen for this parable is a very strong one. God is not compared to the unjust judge, but contrasted with him. If this hard-hearted, wicked judge, who cared only for himself, would grant the request of the widow because of her perseverance, how much more will God our Father, who is holy, and who is pleased with the importunity of His children, answer when they call upon Him. Again, the widow was probably a stranger to the judge, had no promises from him, and could have access to him only at stated times, and then against his will; while God's elect are His beloved children in whom He delights. They have many precious promises from Him, and are urgently requested to come to Him at all times.

6. "(1) Not because God is unwilling to bestow good things, or must be overpersuaded; for He is more ready to give than we are to ask. (2) It is to cherish and cultivate our faith, bringing us into closer relations to God. (3) It is to make us fit to receive, to intensify our desire and appreciation of the things God would bestow."— Peloubet's Notes.

"Give me these links -- (1) Sense of need; (2) Desire to get; (3) Belief that God has it in store; (4) Belief that though He withholds a while, He loves to be asked; and (5) Belief that asking will obtain — give me these links, and the chain will reach from earth to heaven, bringing heaven all down to me, or bearing me up into heaven."— William Arnot, quoted by Peloubet.
