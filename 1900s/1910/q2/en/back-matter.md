# THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR

This splendid little paper occupies the same place in relation to our young people that the Review holds with the older ones.

It is becoming more and more evident that the burden of the work in giving the message is to rest on the young people of this denomination.

How necessary, then, that they should have the best of instruction and guidance in their preparation for the work.

The Instructor is designed to fill this place and should be found in the home of every sabbath-keeper.

Eight pages, published weekly.

# THE DESIRE OF AGES

"THE DESIRE OF AGES" is a large volume of 866 7x10-inch pages, the keynote of which is the great truth that "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself."

Christ said, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me." The working out of this purpose is traced through the life of Christ on earth. It is shown how Christ, as man's representative, endured the temptations by which man is overcome, and conquered in his behalf; and that man, becoming partaker of the divine nature, is enabled to overcome as Christ overcame. God in Christ, and Christ in His followers, can withstand all the power of Satan. And as Christ came to reveal the love of God, so His followers are to reveal the love of Christ.

From another standpoint this volume is a study of the life of Christ and His disciples. It is

A Grand Book, and
Can Not Be Praised Too Highly

Its illustrations alone cost over six thousand dollars, and are strikingly beautiful.
