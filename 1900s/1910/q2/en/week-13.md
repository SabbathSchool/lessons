## Notes

1. The Sadducees were a religious party of the Jews. They rejected all tradition, held to so strenuously by the Pharisees, placing their chief reliance on the law, or writings of Moses. They refused to accept doctrines that could not be traced to Moses, hence their question at this time and Jesus' proof from the Pentateuch. They were extremely materialistic and skeptical. Though their numbers were small, the high priest and many members of the Sanhedrin were Sadducees at this time. They were the "higher critics" of their time.

2. "The Sadducees had flattered themselves that they of all men adhered most strictly to the Scriptures. But Jesus showed that they had not known their true meaning. That knowledge must be brought home to the heart by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. Their ignorance of the Scriptures and the power of God He declared to be the cause of their confusion of faith and darkness of mind. They were seeking to bring the mysteries of God within the compass of their finite reasoning. Christ called upon them to open their minds to those sacred truths that would broaden and strengthen the understanding. Thousands become infidels because their finite minds can not comprehend the mysteries of God. They can not explain the wonderful exhibition of divine power in His providences, therefore they reject the evidences of such power, attributing them to natural agencies which they can comprehend still less. The only key to the mysteries that surround us is to acknowledge in them all, the presence and power of God."—"Desire of Ages," page 605.

3. Isaac and Jacob were not then alive, but in God's purpose they were. "God counts the things that are not, as though they were. He sees the end from the beginning, and beholds the result of His work as though it were now accomplished. The precious dead, from Adam down to the last saint who dies, will hear the voice of the Son of God, and will come forth from the grave to immortal life. God will be their God, and they shall be His people. There will be a close and tender relationship between God and the risen saints. This condition, which is anticipated in His purpose, He beholds as if it were already existing. The dead live unto Him."—"Desire of Ages," page 606.

4. "The Pharisees had exalted the first four commandments, which point out the duty of man to his Maker, as of far greater consequence than the other six, which define man's duty to his fellow man. As the result they greatly failed of practical godliness. Jesus had shown the people their great deficiency, and had taught the necessity of good works, declaring that the tree is known by its fruits. For this reason He had been charged with exalting the last six commandments above the first four."—"Desire of Ages," page 606.

5. "When God has His rightful place on the throne of the heart, the right place will be given to our neighbor. We shall love him as ourselves. And only as we love God supremely is it possible to love our neighbor impartially."—"Desire of Ages," page 607.
