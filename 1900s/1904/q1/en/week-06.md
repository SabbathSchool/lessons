### Notes

1. This text states that at the end of the 2,300 days, "then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." When the believers in the great advent message found that those days were to end in 1844 A.D., they reasoned that the earth was the sanctuary; that its cleansing would be by fire, at the second coming of Christ; therefore Christ must come on the tenth day of the seventh month, in that year. They overlooked the fact that nowhere in the Bible is the earth spoken of, or referred to, as the sanctuary. They overlooked the fact, also, that the only sanctuary in existence in A.D. 1844 was the one in heaven, where our Great High Priest ministers.

2. By a careful study of the yearly rounds of service in that sanctuary built by Moses, with its two holy places, which were "figures of the true," the great truth is revealed that the sins of all who repent and turn to God are transferred to the heavenly sanctuary, and that the cleansing of that sanctuary will be the removal of those sins, when the blotting-out time comes. See Acts 3:19, 20.

3. The slaying of the Lord's goat represented a voluntary death TO sin. The goat for Azazel, that was sent away to "bear upon him all the iniquity of the children of Israel," represented an involuntary death IN sin.

4. The same choice that was left to Christ, after He had "taken man's place, with all of its risks and liabilities," to die a voluntary death to sin, or suffer an involuntary death in sin, is also left for us to make. "The wages of sin is death." The old man must die. Either he will be "crucified with Christ," or perish in the lake of fire with Azazel.
