### Notes

1. Lord Salisbury, prime minister of Great Britain, in a speech delivered Nov. 9, 1895, uttered the following words:—

"Turkey is in that remarkable condition that it has now stood for half a century, mainly because the great powers of the world have resolved that for the peace of Christendom it is necessary that the Ottoman Empire should stand. They came to that conclusion nearly half a century ago. I do not think they have altered it now."

2. It must be clear to every careful reader that the driving of the Turk from the soil of Europe will be the fulfilment of the closing verse of the eleventh chapter of Daniel's prophecy. What makes this line of prophecy of momentous interest to every one now living is the fact that the downfall of the Turkish Empire will be the signal of the most sublime events that the world has ever witnessed. The prophecy closes with the first two verses of chapter 12.
