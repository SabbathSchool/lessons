        Total, 490 years

15. Did the gospel cease to go to the Jews exclusively in A.D. 34? See Acts 8:1-5, 25 (date in margin).

*"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our watchword.*

16. Beginning in the autumn of B.C. 457, when must the whole period of 2,300 years terminate?—The autumn of 1844.

17. What event was looked for in the autumn of 1844?—Students of prophecy looked for the second advent at that date, when they saw that the prophetic period would be fulfilled.

18. What two events had they confused?—The cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary and the destruction of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ. (Future lessons will explain.)

### Notes

1. Since the vision of chapter 8 was in the last year of Belshazzar, and the prayer of the ninth chapter in the first year of Darius, who took the throne on the death of Belshazzar, the time between the chapters need not have been more than a few months, or even weeks.

2. Since it takes the commandments of Cyrus (B.C. 536—Ezra 1), of Darius (B.C. 519—Ezra 6), and of Artaxerxes (B.C. 457—Ezra 7) to constitute "the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem," it is apparent that we must date from the last one, since the "commandment" was not complete until Artaxerxes' decree was issued.

3. In the midst of this last seven-year period, or week, just three and a half years from the autumn of A.D. 27, when Jesus was anointed the Christ at His baptism, He was crucified (the spring of A.D. 31), thus causing the sacrifices to cease.
