### Notes

1. Each year's round of services in the earthly sanctuary was a complete type of the entire priesthood of our Saviour.

2. It is evident that these "four and twenty elders" seated upon thrones, and those associated with them, are persons who have been redeemed from this earth. It is that company who "came out of their graves after His resurrection." Matt. 27:50-53. It is that multitude of captives (Eph. 4:8, margin) that Jesus led up to heaven with Him when He ascended.

3. It is a glorious thought that, when "God shall judge the world, by that Man whom He hath ordained," the One to whom all judgment has been committed will be "the Man Christ Jesus," One who has suffered, as a man, all the weaknesses and temptations of humanity, and therefore is fitted to be a merciful and faithful High Priest. Not only so, but associated with that "Man Christ Jesus" is a multitude of those who have been redeemed by His blood. Oh, how much better that your sins and mine be "opened beforehand" to the scrutiny of that human-heavenly tribunal, while the precious blood of the Man of Calvary is efficacious in blotting them from the books of God's remembrance, than to have them "follow after" and meet us at a time when they will be opened to the gaze of the whole universe.

4. When our High Priest, in His own person, bears our sins from the sanctuary, those sins will then be rolled back upon the head of the antitypical scapegoat, the originator of sin.
