## Notes

1. The Lord did not hand down His law to man through inspiration the same as He did other portions of His Word. He came down from the throne in flaming fire, and earthquake power, and wrote it Himself on the imperishable stone.

2. "In the holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of it was purest gold. . . . In the ark was the golden pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of stone which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and I saw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of God. On one table was four, and on the other six. The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth, the Sabbath commandment, shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of God's holy name. The holy Sabbath looked glorious—a halo of glory was all around it."—Early Writings, page 26.

3. God's kingdom includes more than this speck of a world. It takes in every world on high, and every created intelligence, both angels and men. Within this universal kingdom there is but one King and one law, the law which is in the heavenly sanctuary, a copy of which was given to Moses to place in the ark.

4. The law, being an expression of the everlasting righteousness of God's character, is as enduring as the very existence of its Author. The law cannot justify us, for we have all transgressed its precepts. By looking into it we see ourselves sinners, lost, and in need of a Saviour. It thus points us to Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

5. Sin being the transgression of law, sin can therefore exist only where there is law. This shows clearly that the law was in existence prior to the introduction of sin into the world. Sin came because of its transgression. And the fact that sin could exist in any planet, as well as this one, shows the claims of the law to be universal.

6. "Christ was not only the Leader of the Hebrews in the wilderness—the Angel in whom was the name of Jehovah, and who, veiled in the cloudy pillar, went before the host—but it was He who gave the law to Israel. Amid the awful glory of Sinai, Christ declared, in the hearing of all the people, the ten precepts of His Father's law. It was He who gave to Moses the law engraved upon the tables of stone."

"He who proclaimed the law from Sinai, and delivered to Moses the precepts of the ritual law, is the same that spoke the sermon on the mount."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 366.

*The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.*
