## Notes

1. Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70. So, for nearly forty years, they were to pray that they might not have to flee from their homes upon the Sabbath day. That this was not because of a fear, as some claim, that the gates of the city would be closed on the Sabbath, is seen from the fact that all Judea is spoken of. Matt. 24:16. It was because the Sabbath was holy.

2. This would have been a good opportunity for Paul to have instructed these Gentile converts concerning the change of the Sabbath had such a change been made. That nothing was said concerning the matter, or any service held till the next Sabbath, shows that no change of the Sabbath had been made at this time. "We must go to later than apostolic times for the establishment of Sunday observance."—Christian at Work, 1884.

3. Upon this occasion they met for worship by the riverside, which shows that they did not meet in the synagogues on the Sabbath simply because the Jews met upon that day. Note that in all these texts the Spirit of God calls that day upon which they met the Sabbath day.
