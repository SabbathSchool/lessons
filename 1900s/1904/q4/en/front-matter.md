## AN OPINION

"Uncle Ben's Cobblestones" beautifully demonstrates in one brief, unique little volume, how the "common things" of life may become more useful than even acres of diamonds; for after all is said and done, it is the ability to use a thing that makes it of real worth to us. Uncle Ben's whole purpose seems to point to "wealth of character" and real "soul culture."

There is a ray of sunshine streaming throughout the entire volume. At the same time there is a staid sobriety of good cheer that never once touches the fickle so prevalent in books written for the children of our day. Observation and application are two of the greatest features in character-building. Uncle Ben seems to know what he is talking about along these lines. These two lessons are taught on every page in the book. No child can escape their meaning. And with these lessons there is a moral fragrance that cannot fail to please every true parent. The spirit of the book is good for the older children. It makes one feel as though he would like to live a century, do good, and grow old gracefully.

# Great Threefold Gospel Message.

FOR SENIOR CLASSES.

Fourth Quarter, 1904.

**General Note**—These studies are not intended to be exhaustive of the subjects considered. The design, rather, is to present in simple form a study of some of the great fundamental truths of the message; to review some of the truths which have called out this people. This we believe will be a great blessing to our youth, as well as to those who have been longer in the way. The Bible is full of these rich truths. So let none rest satisfied with a bare study of the texts presented in the lessons. Explore the great mine of truth from week to week and gather for your using its priceless gems.
