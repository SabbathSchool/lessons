## Notes

1. Satan was bidding for the soul of the world's Redeemer, and, when other efforts to overcome Him had failed, he offered Him as a bribe the greatest thing he had to give, viz., the dominion of the earth usurped from man. It was this Jesus came to restore to man, not by bowing to Satan, but by conquering him through death.

2. Through disobedience man lost his innocence and purity, his life, and his Eden home. All this Jesus came to seek and to restore to the obedient.

3. Stephen established before his accusers the resurrection of the dead, by showing that God made a promise to Abraham which was not fulfilled while he lived, and he must, therefore, be raised from the dead to receive its fulfilment. God's Word is sure. Even death cannot hinder its fulfilment.

4. The reward of obedience is eternal life. Rom. 6:23. This reward will not be spent in some region "beyond the bounds of time and space," but the Lord has provided a real home in the regenerated earth in which His people will enjoy the bliss of eternal life.
