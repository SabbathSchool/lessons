### Notes

1. Winds are used as symbolic of war and strife. Dan. 7:2; Jer. 23:35-33.

2. Creative power is the distinguishing feature of the living God. Acts 14:15. See Rom. 4:11 for proof that sign and seal have the same meaning.

3. The silence in heaven at the opening of the seventh seal shows that this seal covers the actual appearing of Christ in the clouds of heaven as He comes with all the angels to gather His saints. Ministry in heaven ceases, and the scene of activity among the heavenly beings is transferred to the earth for a little time, until the hosts of angels and the redeemed, led by their Captain and Saviour, return to the city of God. Half an hour, prophetic time, would be about seven days. In a description of this scene in "Early Writings" we are told: "We all entered the cloud together, and were seven days ascending to the sea of glass." — P. 12.
