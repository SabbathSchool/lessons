### Notes

1. "On account of the desolate character of this island, it was used, under the Roman Empire, as a place of banishment, which accounts for the exile of John thither. The banishment of the apostle took place about the year 94, as is generally supposed, under the Emperor Domitian; and from this fact the date assigned to the writing of the Revelation is A. D. 95 or 96." — Thoughts on Revelation.

2. The blessing promised to those who read and hear comes only as the third condition is fulfilled, by the keeping of the things written. We are not studying merely to learn interesting facts regarding the past fulfilment of prophecy. These are all essential in the proper understanding of the book, but the study will be of lasting value only as we seek God for grace to learn how to keep in our own lives the lessons of the past and the warnings and counsels, all written for us. The "sayings of the prophecy of this book" are things to be daily kept by those who would be prepared for the coming of Christ. Rev. 22:7.

3. "The seven churches." Under the names of the seven churches in Asia, the Holy Spirit has delineated seven different stages of the Christian church, which appear in succession, extending from the apostolic days to the coming of the Lord and the consummation of all things. In other words, these messages to the seven churches constitute a connected prophecy of the church of Christ on earth, during seven periods of time, covering the entire history of the church from the first to the second advent. The messages to all the churches therefore come to us who live in the last days.
