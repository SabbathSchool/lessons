### Notes

1. The number seven is used repeatedly throughout the book, evidently to denote fulness and completion. So just seven churches represent the complete history.

2. The word "Ephesus" means "desirable." The church in this period — in the days of apostolic labor — had enjoyed the doctrine of Christ in its purity; also the benefits and blessings of the Holy Spirit received.

3. The first love, the warmth of affection experienced when the Saviour was first received and the hope of the message first dawned upon the mind, had faded out somewhat in process of years, under cares and trials. "Lord, is it I?"

4. The first love must be renewed by coming to Jesus for the forgiveness of all sin, the full surrender of the heart, and then, constrained by the love of Jesus for others, the new convert, though perhaps old professor, will have a new experience to tell, a new song to sing, even praise unto God. Then missionary work of all kinds will be not a duty alone, but a joy; yet still a duty to which the believer must sternly hold himself against all the tendency of the flesh to become careless. Just here was the failure of the early church.

5. The sect of Nicolaitanes was one of the earliest of the parties that sprang up within the church, undermining the truth by mysticism and fanciful teaching. Under profession of a higher philosophy of God and a more spiritual understanding of the doctrines of Christ, they brought heathen notions and moral corruptions into the church.

6. This and other references show plainly that the Eden that once was on earth has been transplanted to heaven.

7. "Smyrna" signifies "myrrh," fit appellation for the church of God while passing through the fiery furnace of persecution and proving herself a "sweet-smelling savor" unto Him. — Thoughts on Revelation.

8. "Which was dead and is alive." This is an assurance that One who has gone down into Satan's prison-house, conquered death, and brought the key away with Him, was qualified to bear a message of hope and comfort to the church in that age when many were to seal their testimony with their blood.

9. In these times of pagan persecution, the issue was practically the same as we must again face — the Christian principle of religious liberty as opposed to the Roman principle of governmental regulation of religion. The Roman law was: "No man shall have for himself particular gods of his own; no man shall worship by himself any new or foreign gods, unless they are recognized by the public laws." The prophecy speaks of "ten days." The last and severest persecution of this period was a sustained effort to suppress Christianity, lasting ten years. Ten days, prophetic time — a day for a year — would be ten years, literal time. "It was not till A. D. 311," says Lecky, "ten years after the first measure against the Christians, that the Eastern persecution ceased. Galerius, the arch-enemy of the Christians, was struck down by a fearful disease." He suspended his edict and besought Christians to pray for his recovery.
