# AN OLD FRIEND RETURNED

WHEN a dear friend returns after a long absence, how gladly we welcome him! What satisfaction his very presence brings! Perhaps he has helped us over some hard place, or encouraged us in some trial—has in fact proven himself "a friend indeed."

Just as gladly do the Sabbath-school officers and teachers welcome the return of the Sabbath-school Worker. Its familiar face brings encouragement to all. It was a help in the past, and we have missed it so sadly during its absence that it now seems doubly welcome.

We are not disappointed on a closer acquaintance, either, for although smaller in size than before, it still has just the helpful suggestions, the reports from other schools, the instruction for teachers and officers, which we all need. Its "Helps on the Sabbath-school Lessons" for each week and for every division of the school are more valuable than ever, and contain just the information for which every earnest teacher feels the need.

The price, too, is so low that all can now afford to have it-35 cents per year to individual addresses, or 25 cents a copy where two or more copies are sent to one name and address.

You will surely need the Worker for 1904.

# A PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE

## A MOST VALUABLE SERIES OF ARTICLES ENTITLED
## "Hints and Helps for Sabbath-School Teachers"

will begin in the April number of the Worker. These articles are by a veteran teacher and Sabbath-school worker, Prof. C. C. Lewis. The following list of topics will give some idea of the treat that is in store for our readers. We especially urge all schools that have not yet sent in an order for the journal, to do so at once, that they may have the benefit of this complete series:—

### The Teacher's Calling and Opportunity

#### The Teacher in His Study
- The study of the lesson.
- The study of the pupils.
- How to adapt the lesson to the pupils.

#### The Teacher Before His Class
- How to secure and hold attention.
- How to make the lesson clear and forcible.
- How to ask questions.
- How to manage the class.
- How to Review.

#### The Teacher Outside of His Class
- Being what he wants his pupils to be.
- Winning confidence and influencing pupils.
- Counseling and aiding pupils.
- Helping pupils to decide for Christ.

# GOOD THINGS COMING IN THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES

FROM the pen of Prof. G. W. Rine, who has for years been a student of the subject, we shall soon present the following articles under the general heading:—

## The Industrial Conflict in the Light of Revelation

(1) Work a Duty and a Blessing; (2) Wealth and the Obligation It Imposes; (3) The Demon of Avarice; (4) Monopoly, Its Nature and History; (5) Present-Day Monopoly; (6) Phenomenal Increase of Wealth in the End of the Age; (7) Congestion of Wealth versus Diffusion of Knowledge; (8) Prevalence and Duration of Poverty; (9) "Lovers of Pleasures;" (10) Lawlessness of Labor; (11) What Will the Harvest Be? (12) How the Problem Will Be Solved; (13) "They Shall Not Build and Another Inhabit."

The above are not to be considered as exact titles, but as indicating the general scope of the subject.

We know that these will be intensely interesting. The paper for this period of time ought to receive a large number of short-term subscriptions.

Another writer, Elder F. D. Starr, who has read the Bible through more than a score of times, besides giving it much special study, has read it in Greek, German, French; and the New Testament in Latin and Hollandish, will furnish a series of articles on the books of the Bible, one on each book.

These will be a great help to old and young in getting a more general knowledge of the wonderful Book.

These are only a few of the good things. It is always thoroughly alive and interesting, filled with timely matter that you and your friends and neighbors ought to read.

Clubs of five or more copies to one name and address, one year, 90 cents per copy.

# Some Interesting Pamphlets

## MATTHEW TWENTY-FOUR
The question "What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the world?" was not only in the minds of the disciples as they sat overlooking Jerusalem on that day so long ago, but was, and is, the one great question which interests all. The Saviour's answer, as recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, is therefore of interest to every individual. Its exposition, as given in the work entitled "Matthew Twenty-four," is complete, thorough, and readable. Bound in paper covers. Price 10c.

## MARSHALING OF THE NATIONS
A pamphlet of 44 pages, dealing with the movements of the great nations of to day, showing how a few great powers are rapidly gaining control of the whole world. There is a meaning in all this that concerns every one, and the writer brings forth light from the divine Word for our consideration and profit. There are several instructive maps, showing the partitioning of the world as it is being made. Price 10 cents each.

## SCRIPTURE REFERENCES
A valuable compilation of Scripture texts, arranged to assist the reader in the study of a large number of Bible subjects, such as: The Second Advent, Home of the Saved, Millennium, Sanctuary, Sabbath, Spiritualism, Nature and Destiny of Man, etc. The texts are used in proof of leading propositions made under each subject, and will be found a real help to Bible study. 32 pages. Price 2 cents each or $1.40 per hundred.

## MODERN MYSTERIES—Their Moral Aspect
This new number of the Bible Students' Library is attracting attention everywhere. It takes up the questions of Clairvoyance, Mind-Reading, Hypnotism, Theosophy, New Thought, and Pantheism in a way that will interest and instruct. Price 15 cents.

## IS SUNDAY THE TRUE SABBATH OF GOD?
This is a reply to S. W. Gamble's work entitled "Sunday the True Sabbath of God." Those who have heard Mr. Gamble's theories, or even heard about them, will read with interest and profit this logical refutation of his teaching. Price 10 cents.
