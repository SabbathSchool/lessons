### Notes

1. The preaching of the Gospel is committed to men and not to angels. 2 Cor. 5:19. Yet in the symbolism of Revelation angels are repeatedly used to represent evident activities in the church on earth in the preaching of Gospel messages to men. And there is something more than symbolism in this representation, as angels join as unseen helpers in the work of the church for the world. Heb. 1:14. Wherever the servant of God on earth goes with the message, with him will angels go, and it may well be that to a mighty angel is committed the general oversight of this or that special movement; for the view we get of heaven shows order and system in the angelic hosts.

2. The attitude indicates the world-wide proclamation of his message by land and sea.

3. The time of the end had come, and the thoughts of men were to be directed to the second coming of Christ. The moment was at hand when the last sands of time were to run out from the last hour-glass of definite prophetic time. No longer would prophetic time-periods point the way in history toward the approaching end. The longest time-period in prophecy, the 2,300 days, or years, of Dan. 8:14 (reaching from the commandment to restore Jerusalem, 457 B. C., to 1844), was now to close. The event was signalized by the great Advent proclamation sounded by land and sea to all the world in the years just preceding 1844.

4. The book of Daniel is the only prophetic book giving the specific time of the cleansing of the sanctuary, the finishing work of Christ's ministry. It is the only book that was declared shut and sealed to the time of the end. The words in Revelation 10 indicate a book that had been shut, which then was to be opened. The great Advent Movement was based on the opening of the prophecies, particularly of Daniel, to the understanding of men, for the time was at hand. The preaching of these prophecies stirred the world in the 1844 times.

5. The mystery of God is the Gospel. When its work is finished and Christ closes His ministry for sin, it is evident that all who will be saved at His coming will have allowed grace to finish its work in the heart. To the believer living at the close of probation, the finishing of the mystery means a preparing of the soul for translation to heaven, — the life to be pure, clean, unselfish, holy, every evil disposition overcome.

"Then, O my Lord, prepare  
My soul for that grand day.  
O, wash me in Thy precious blood,  
And take my sins away."
