## Notes

1. The description given of this beast indicates that the characteristics of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome have been inherited by the Papacy, of which this symbol is a representative. Though professedly Christian, it wages a relentless warfare against truth and righteousness. It continues till the end, and goes alive into the lake of fire. Rev. 19:20; Dan. 7:26.

2. The dragon is a symbol of Satan. Satan offered his seat and great authority to Christ once when He was here on earth. Luke 4:5-7. The price which he placed upon it was that Jesus should bow down and worship him. It is not reasonable to suppose that he has transferred it to the beast for anything less; so that power is, therefore, the servant, full and complete, of the prince of darkness, pledged to bow down and do obeisance to him. Any homage, therefore, that is rendered to this ecclesiastical power, is in reality paying homage to the evil power by which sin came into the world.

3. This wound was inflicted when the beast went into captivity in A.D. 1798, when the French general, Berthier, entered Rome and took the pope prisoner, and abolished for a time the papal government—a deadly wound indeed.
