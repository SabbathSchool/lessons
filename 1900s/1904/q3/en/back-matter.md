# A Book for Young People

Young people are always interested in knowing how successful men succeeded. They want to know how they used the difficulties which every person must meet as stepping stones to higher attainments. If these successful men did make mistakes, young people want to know how they made them, so that they may the more easily avoid doing likewise.

In the recent work, "Education," by Mrs. E. G. White, the lives of such Bible characters as David, Solomon, Job, Moses, Joseph, and others are treated in a way that will intensely interest every young person desiring to make the most of his opportunities. There are also important chapters on Business Principles and Methods, Proper Recreation, Manual Training, and Physical Culture.

Its price in full leather is $2.50; in cloth, $1.25.

# SOUL-THRILLING TRACTS

## BABYLON IS FALLEN!
A startling statement indeed, and one which requires an explanation. The statement is made in Rev. 14:8, and the explanation is found in this tract. It tells what Babylon is, what her fall means, and how it concerns us.
Price 1½ cents; $1.00 per hundred.

## THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES
This is another very timely and thrilling tract on a subject that concerns every one now living. The writer briefly portrays the events leading up to the time when the plagues are poured out, showing who are to suffer this dreadful scourge of God's wrath, and then gives an exposition of each plague, with the effect they will have on the earth and man.
Price 3 cents each; per hundred, $2.15.

## THE MILLENNIUM
What is it? Where is it? And when is it? are questions that are agitating, as well as confusing, many minds. This tract clears up the obscurities by defining the term, and producing Bible information as to where it will take place, and when.
Price 1½ cents each, or $1.00 per hundred.

## THE EASTERN QUESTION
In this tract we find the solution of the great problem which centers in the "Sick Man of the East"— Turkey. It touches briefly the prophecies concerning the rise of this power, and portrays its final end; also the world's crisis as connected with this ominous event.
Price 1 cent, or 70 cents per hundred.

# SOUL-THRILLING TRACTS

## THE RETURN OF THE JEWS
The subject treated in this tract is one that has attracted the general attention of Bible students, but, unfortunately, is not well understood. The writer presents the subject from the standpoint of God's promise to Abraham, clearly showing who are the true Israel, and when and where they will be gathered. Illustrated.
Price 2 cents each, or $1.30 per hundred.

## HERALDS OF HIS COMING
Is it a literal coming? Is the end really near? May we know the time? These are a few of the questions answered in this tract. Some of the special signs of Christ's second coming are pointed out, emphasized by an original chart, portraying in a vivid manner the points dwelt upon.
Price 1½ cents each, or $1.00 per hundred.

## THE GREAT THREE-FOLD MESSAGE
The Gospel of saving grace has been ever the same in all ages, but special messages of warning have also been given as telling factors in the saving work. Noah gave a message in his day, and John the Baptist another. The writer shows in this tract that a great Three-Fold Message is to be given to the world in our day, warning them of the dreadful calamities coming, and pointing out the way of escape.
Price 1 cent each, or 70 cents per hundred.

# SOUL-THRILLING TRACTS

## SIGNS OF OUR TIMES
Every thoughtful mind must be alarmed at the outlook in the world to-day, among the nations, in society, in the church, but how few have an intelligent understanding of what these things mean, as well as the disturbances in nature. Not only does this tract point out the signs and show their import, but gives a message of hope and comfort to God's people.
Price 1 cent each, or 70 cents per hundred.

## MARSHALLING OF THE NATIONS
Have you noted the movements of the great nations of to-day and been impressed that these movements must sooner or later effect the whole world? Have you divined that the grasping after territory must finally culminate in the last great battle, where, the Scriptures tell us, "the kings of the earth and of the whole world" are gathered? This pamphlet treats the subject in a way that will leave no room for conjecture. You should read it and circulate it everywhere at this opportune time. 44 pages.
Price 10 cents.

## MODERN MYSTERIES
A pamphlet of rare merit, treating the subjects of Hypnotism, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, Theosophy, the New Thought, and Pantheism. The writer deals with these great deceptions in a vigorous manner, and shows up their moral aspect in no uncertain light. You will be edified by reading, also your neighbors. 108 pages.
Price 15 cents.
