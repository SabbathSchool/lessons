## Notes

1. Unless this world is inhabited, its creation will have been in vain. What is true of this world is true of all the others also, which shows, incidentally, that all the worlds are inhabited. This world is the lost sheep of the universe. Jesus came to seek and to save all that was lost as a result of sin. This will include a restoration of the dominion which was lost by Adam because of transgression, and man's restoration to his home in the new earth.

2. The lives of the wicked will not be prolonged in an eternal state of suffering to curse their Creator throughout endless ages. No such blot will remain to mar the work of God. The marks of the crucifixion, which the Redeemer carries in His body, will be the only reminder of sin that will remain. See "Great Controversy," page 674.

3. "There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls, most glorious to behold, which were to be inhabited by the saints, and in which was a golden shelf. I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into the field by the houses to do something with the earth; not as we have to do with the earth here; no, no. A glorious light shone all about their heads, and they were continually shouting and offering praises to God." —Early Writings, page 14.

4. The earth itself, the very field which Satan claims as his, is to be not only ransomed, but exalted. Our little world, under the curse of sin, the one dark blot in His glorious creation, will be honored above all other worlds in the universe of God. Here, where the Son of God tabernacled in humanity, where the King of glory lived and suffered and died,—here, when He shall make all things new, the tabernacle of God shall be with men, 'and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.' " —Desire of Ages, page 26.
