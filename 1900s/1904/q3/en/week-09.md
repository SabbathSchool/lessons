## Notes

1. Christ evidently is the One who speaks from the throne. He has passed through all the experiences of the redeemed, and met the fiercest assaults of the enemy. He is still the Son of man. "In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us." He still bears in His body the marks of the crucifixion. Now He beholds with supreme joy the travail of His soul and is satisfied. Isa. 53:11. He bids the ransomed host to sing, and they respond with such a chorus of praise as has never been heard in heaven before.

2. "Soon we heard His lovely voice again, saying, 'Come, My people, you have come out of great tribulation, and done My will; suffered for Me; come in to supper, for I will gird Myself, and serve you.' We shouted, 'Alleluia, glory,' and entered into the city. And I saw a table of pure silver; it was many miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many other kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said: 'Not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink of the water of the fountain.'" —Early Writings, page 15.

3. When John heard this triumphant song from all the redeemed host, arrayed in their glorious robes of righteousness, and saw them seated at the marriage supper of the Lamb around that table which is "miles in length," he was so overcome by the sublimity and splendor of the scene that he fell at the feet of Gabriel, who was revealing it to him, to worship him. If a view of the scene so affected the prophet, what will it be to be really there?

*"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest."*
