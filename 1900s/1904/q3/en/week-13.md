## Notes

1. The city will be so resplendent with the glory of the Lord that it will need no light of sun or moon, for the glory of the Lord is brighter than the sun. Acts 26:12, 13. The sun and moon will exist to lighten the earth, shining with increased brilliancy. Isa. 30:26.

2. There will be nations in the new earth whose rulers are called kings. The Saviour, in answer to a question propounded by Peter upon a certain occasion, said that when all things were regenerated, the apostles would sit on twelve thrones, ruling the twelve tribes, or nations, of Israel. Matt. 19:28.

3. It is not stated that there will be no temple in the new earth, but only that there will be none in the city. It appears, from Rev. 7:15, that there will be a temple, located, perhaps, outside of the city. The 144,000 only will enter this temple. See "Early Writings," pages 14, 15.

4. "Out of the throne came a pure river of water, and on either side of the river was the tree of life. On one side of the river was a trunk of a tree, and a trunk on the other side of the river, both of pure, transparent gold. At first I thought I saw two trees. I looked again, and saw that they were united at the top in one tree." —Early Writings, pages 12, 13.

5. Once more, as in chapter 19:10, the overwhelming glory which John beheld of Paradise restored overcame him, and, lost in admiration of the sight, he fell down to worship the angel. The angel again refused to accept the homage, and left on record the comforting assurance that he was not only the fellow servant with John, but all those also who keep the sayings of this wonderful book.
