# Lesson 5 — The Judgment Message

JULY 30, 1904

## General Note

The line of prophecy commenced in chapter 12, closed with the fifth verse of chapter 14, with a description of the overcomers in the redeemed state. A new line of prophecy is now introduced. The prophet begins with the hour of the judgment impending, and emphasizes the Gospel messages which will be given as specially applicable to the solemnity of that time; a period just before the coming of the Lord.

In connection with this study, read the chapter entitled, "The Judgment," in "Testimonies for the Church," Vol. 4, pages 384-387.

## Notes

1. "I saw a company who stood well guarded and firm, and giving no countenance to those who would unsettle the established faith of the body. God looked upon them with approbation. I was shown three steps,—the first, second, and third angel's messages. Said my accompanying angel: 'Woe to him who shall move a block or stir a pin of these messages. The true understanding of these messages is of vital importance. The destiny of souls hangs upon the manner in which they are received.'" —Early Writings, page 121.

2. When the Lord wishes to represent earthly governments, he selects as the most fitting symbol a wild and ravenous beast. But the work of the Gospel for these last days is represented by an angel flying in the heaven. Though the Gospel is preached by men, doubtless special angels have charge of the work.

3. The judgment is a real thing. The Judge upon the throne is a real, actual, personal Being; the throne upon which He is seated is a real throne; the books opened are real books; the angels who surround the throne are real angels; and those who are being judged are real beings.

4. The judgment message, being a Gospel message, must be given before probation closes. It is synonymous with the cleansing of the sanctuary, and began at the end of the 2300 days of Dan. 8:14, on the tenth day of the seventh month, of Oct. 22, 1844—nearly threescore years ago.

"The prophecy of the first angel's message, brought to view in Revelation 14, found its fulfilment in the Advent Movement of 1840-1844." —Great Controversy.

5. "Silently, unnoticed as a midnight thief, will come the decisive hour which marks the fixing of every man's destiny, the final withdrawal of mercy's offer to guilty men. . . . While the man of business is absorbed in the pursuit of gain, while the pleasure-lover is seeking indulgence, while the daughter of fashion is arranging her adornments,—it may be in that hour the Judge of all the earth will pronounce the sentence, 'Thou art weighed in the balances, and found wanting.'" —Great Controversy, page 491.
