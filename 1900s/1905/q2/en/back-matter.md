Loughborough, treats the subject of the Spirit of prophecy in the church in a very comprehensive and satisfactory manner.

In Part Second is a consideration of facts respecting a manifestation of the gift of prophecy as connected with the Great Threefold Message of Revelation 14. Many Bible rules and tests are given by which we may prove the true.

# Story of Daniel, the Prophet

A STUDY of one of the most remarkable lives of the Bible, by Elder S. N. Haskell. The lessons drawn from Daniel's character,—his integrity, his devotion to duty, his steadfastness in adhering to true principles in the face of the greatest apparent danger, are most striking, encouraging, and helpful. Not only this, but the wonderful things foretold by the prophet are clearly portrayed, and the time of their application determined.

As the practised eye of the prospector discovers the gems of earth and readily discerns their value, so the writer has found the sparkling beauties in the life and character of this man of God, as well as the interpretation of the marvelous things foretold by him, in which is the key that unlocks history to the end of time.

The book is illustrated, and arranged in a manner to please and profit both old and young.

369 pages. Price, $1.00
