## Notes

1. Some conscientious souls are in distress at times, fearing that because of sin the Spirit of God has been grieved from them forever. But notice that the first work of the Holy Spirit when It comes to the heart is to bring conviction of sin. Those who feel a real sorrow and conviction for sin may rest assured that the tender Spirit of God is still striving with them.

2. "All who were fully identified as disciples of Christ and associated with the apostles as evangelists, assembled together at Jerusalem. They put away all differences. They continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, that they might receive the fulfilment of the promise of the Holy Spirit; for they were to preach the Gospel in the demonstration of the Spirit and in the power of God. . . . This is the very course that should be pursued by those who act a part in the work of proclaiming the coming of the Lord in the clouds of heaven; for a people are to be prepared to stand in the great day of God."â€”Gospel Workers, page 370.
