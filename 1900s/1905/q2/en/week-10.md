## Notes

1. The gift of prophecy is important because it teaches God's will, and all the other gifts in their fulness are dependent upon its reception. Only as the Spirit of prophecy is confirmed in us may we hope to have all the gifts. 1 Cor. 1:4-8.

2. So long as the Spirit of God is in the earth, the gifts of the Spirit will be seen in a greater or less degree. In the closing days of earth's history, when the power of Satan will be manifested in no ordinary manner, it is reasonable, as well as scriptural, that the operations of the Holy Spirit will be witnessed in a special manner, and the gifts of the Spirit be revealed in the church. God placed these gifts in the church "for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering unto the building up of the body of Christ," and they will remain there until the church militant becomes the church triumphant. Note that among other gifts in the church is that of prophecy. As this is the greatest gift (1 Cor. 14:1, 39), we may expect that it will be the leading gift.
