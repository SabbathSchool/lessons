## Notes

1. The Lord warned man that the penalty for sin was death. Satan plainly contradicted the word of God by stating that man would not die, but be "as God, knowing good and evil." The doctrine therefore of consciousness in death has its origin wholly from this declaration of Satan in Eden. To make good his statement, "Ye shall not die," he has filled the world with the false idea of an immortal soul which survives the stroke of death, and continues to live separate from the body.

2. The statement concerning Abraham that he was "gathered to his people" could not mean that he went to be with them in a conscious state of existence, for his ancestors were all idolaters. Josh. 24:2.

3. At creation, the Lord breathed into the man whom He had made the breath of life. In death the process is reversed. The Lord takes from every living creature that which was given at creation, viz., the breath, and death results. Ps. 104:29. But that which the Lord takes from man at death was not a conscious entity prior to the time man received it; neither is it after death.
