## Notes

1. Through a belief in the immortality of the soul, many have been led to believe that angels are the spirits of the dead. That this belief is erroneous is evident from the fact that angels existed before man, or even this world, was created.

2. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His people, and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel. If the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger, the angels that ever attend them would fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and the angels in the city would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission another angel to descend to encourage, watch over, and try to keep them from going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed to the watchful care of these angels, and would not be comforted by them, but continued to go astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They would bear the tidings upward, and all the angels in the city would weep, and then with a loud voice say, Amen. But if the saints fixed their eyes upon the prize before them, and glorified God by praising Him, then the angels in the city would touch their golden harps and sing with a loud voice, Alleluiah! and the heavenly arches would ring with their lovely songs."â€”Early Writings, pages 31, 32.

3. As heavenly angels attend us all through life, though unseen to us, they doubtless make a faithful record of all the acts of our lives, and in the judgment will be there ministering unto Him who sits as Judge. The very angel who made the record of your life will be there to bear witness to its truthfulness.
