## Notes

1. Counterfeit money being in circulation in no way discounts the genuine currency; neither will the fact that false prophets are in the earth in any way affect the work of the true prophets. The fact that we are warned against false prophets is evidence that the manifestations of the genuine will be in the earth. If all were to be counterfeit, the Lord could have said, "Beware of prophets."

2. In vision the prophet of the Lord loses his own strength. His breath also is taken away. In this condition, under the direct control of the Holy Spirit, are made such revelations as the Lord is pleased to make. They speak as they are moved by the Holy Spirit. True prophets in vision always have their eyes open.

3. In the life and work of Mrs. E. G. White, whose labors have been identified with this message from its rise, we have the clearest evidence that there is manifested the gift of prophecy as truly as in servants of the Lord in the past. The gift stands every scriptural test, and, through all the perplexities which have attended our work, this gift has been present to direct and point out the right way. Read carefully the chapters written especially upon this subject in "Rise and Progress of Seventh-day Adventists," by Elder J. N. Loughborough.
