## Notes

1. "The system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress the minds of men with a great truth, that God is the source of every blessing to His creatures, and that to Him man's gratitude is due for the good gifts of His providence." "Thus the people were constantly reminded that God was the true proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and herds, that He sent them sunshine and rain for their seed-time and harvests, that every thing that they possessed was of His creation, and they were simply stewards of His goods."â€”Mrs. E. G. White, in the Review and Herald, Sept. 10, 1889.

2. "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel." 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.

   "And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation." Num. 18:21. When the apostle therefore says that "they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple," he has special reference to the tithe. "Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel." Webster defines "even" and "so" "in an equal, or precisely similar manner, precisely the same, exactly, likewise," etc. The word "ordain" he defines, "to appoint; to decree," etc. Cruden says the word means "to command, or enjoin, to appoint, or designate to a certain end, or use," etc. With these definitions before us, let us read 1 Cor. 9:13, 14, supplying the definitions for these terms. "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? . . . In precisely a similar manner hath the Lord appointed, decreed, and enjoined that they which preach the gospel shall live of the gospel."

   None deny that Christ's ministers were supported by the tithe during the Levitical priesthood; but it does not end there; for we have seen that it is a decree of God that those who preach the gospel should be supported in a precisely similar manner as were the Levites. And as we are now under the same Melchisedec priesthood (Heb. 5:5, 6; 6:20) that Abraham was under, it is evident that the tithe has been reserved by Christ to support His ambassadors in all ages of this world, from Adam to the close of probation.

3. "All these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, . . . in the field, . . . in the fruit of thy body, . . . and the fruit of thy cattle, . . . in the increase of thy kine, and flocks of thy sheep, . . . when thou comest in, . . . when thou goest out, . . . and in all thou settest thy hand unto. . . . Thou shalt lend unto many nations, and not borrow; . . . and the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail." O thou Achan in the camp of Israel, no longer conceal thy guilt! Return unto the Lord thy God. "Say unto Him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously." The Lord will respond, "I will heal their backslidings, I will love them freely; for Mine anger is turned away from him." Hosea 14:1-4.
