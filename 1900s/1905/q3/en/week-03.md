## Notes

1. God reserved holy unto Himself the seventh day of time. He also reserved one of the fruit-bearing trees of the garden as a test of man's loyalty, and a recognition of God's ownership.

   Time is essential to man's being. So are the products of the earth. The former would be of no value to man without the latter; and the bounties of the earth could be of no profit to man without time. Hence, God brings a test of character to man touching these essential gifts of God to man.

2. Note the similar claim the Lord lays to the Sabbath and the tithe. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." "All the tithe is the Lord's." Both are "holy" unto the Lord. Lev. 27:30; Ex. 20:10; Isa. 58:13.

   The Sabbath and the tithe are both a test of man's loyalty to his Maker. The first makes known our Creator and God. The second is a means of constant acknowledgment that we receive all earthly blessings from His hands. To disregard the claims of either is a violation of the holy law of God.

3. A careful study of the context shows that these scriptures have a special application in the last days. While Sabbath-breaking and withholding the tithe have always been wrong, the Lord will test the world upon these questions before the end.
