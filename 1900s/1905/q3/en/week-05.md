## Notes

1. Satan disputes the right and title of Christ to this world. Just before the coronation of the Son of God, after the wicked dead are raised, true to his text, Satan's last effort to deceive is upon the same question of the rightful ownership of this world. "Yet true to his early cunning, he does not acknowledge himself to be Satan. He claims to be the prince who is the rightful owner of this world, and whose inheritance has been unlawfully wrested from him. He represents himself to his deluded subjects as a redeemer, assuring them that his power has brought them forth from their graves, and that he is about to rescue them from the most cruel tyranny."â€”Great Controversy, page 663. It is worthy of note that Satan causes the most of strife and carnage among men and nations to arise over questions of ownership, or title, to the things of this world.

2. On which side of this controversy do you stand, my brother and sister? What is your confession of faith and practice upon this vital question? The Lord has reserved to Himself the tithe of all the products of the earth, and of that produced by the mind or muscle of man, as a constant test and acknowledgment from man that Christ is the rightful owner of all. This Satan denies. This is a practical question that will decide the destiny of souls. Says Christ, "Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven." Matt. 10:33.
