## Notes

1. "God is the owner of the whole man, — soul, body and spirit are His. God gave His only-begotten Son for the body as well as the soul, and our entire life belongs to God, to be consecrated to His service, that through the exercise of every faculty He has given, we may glorify Him." — Mrs. E. G. White, in Youth's Instructor, Sept. 7, 1903.

2. "It should ever be kept prominent that the great object to be obtained through this channel [health reform] is not only health, but perfection and the spirit of holiness, which can not be attained with diseased bodies and minds." — Testimonies, Vol. I, page 554.

"Health reform is one branch of the great work which is to fit a people for the coming of the Lord. It is as closely connected with the Third Angel's Message as the hand is with the body." — Testimonies, Vol. III, page 161.

3. "It was in love that our heavenly Father sent the light of health reform to guard against the evils that result from unrestrained appetite." — Christian Temperance, page 134.
