## Healthful Living

This is a book compiled from the writings of Mrs. E. G. White, giving in concise form a vast fund of instruction and information on the fundamental principles of health reform. More than a score of her works, as well as much unpublished manuscript, have been consulted in the production of this book, and the matter brought together and arranged in convenient form for ready reference.

It is not a doctor book in the sense of prescribing remedies, but if one really wishes to live in the truest sense, he will find on every page and in every paragraph more than the proverbial ounce of prevention to assist.

The book contains 324 pages, divided into 42 chapters. It is thoroughly indexed, giving every Scripture text referred to, as well as subjects treated, also a general index referring to paragraphs.

A last opportunity is here given to secure a copy of this valuable little work, as the plates were accidentally burned, and only a limited number of the books are in stock.

Cloth bound. Price, fifty cents.

# SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

## RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND HEALTH AND TEMPERANCE
For Senior Classes

First Quarter, 1905.

### General Note

It has been over nine years now since we had a series of lessons bearing directly on religious liberty. Those who were children only ten or twelve years old then are now young men and women. In view of this, and of the rapid developments that are being made in the movement to restrict religious liberty, which call for intelligent, active, and aggressive counter efforts on our part, it seems highly proper that a few lessons should again be devoted to this subject.
