### Note

"When the protection of human laws shall be withdrawn from those who honor the law of God, there will be, in different lands, a simultaneous movement for their destruction. As the time appointed in the decree draws near, the people will conspire to root out the hated sect. It will be determined in one night to strike a decisive blow, which shall entirely silence the voice of dissent and reproof."â€”Great Controversy, Chap. 40, first paragraph.

"The needs of the cause of God are world-wide."
