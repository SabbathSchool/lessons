### Notes

1. In all probability, Mordecai showed the usual respect to the king. Joseph, Daniel, and Nehemiah, all held high positions in earthly governments, and showed proper respect to their sovereigns; but Mordecai could not bow to Haman without dishonoring God; for God had declared "war with Amalek from generation to generation." Ex. 17:16. He also told His people not to "forget it." Deut. 25:19. The evil nature of Haman would naturally lead him to require more than other men. He required "reverence." Mordecai "refused to show him reverence, which belongs only to God."

2. "The Protestant world today see, in the little company keeping the Sabbath, a Mordecai in the gate."

3. This is the first record of Mordecai revealing his nationality. In view of the texts given in Note 1, the fact that Mordecai was a Jew was sufficient reason for not bowing to Haman.

4. "Satan will excite indignation against the humble minority who conscientiously refuse to accept popular customs and traditions."

5. "Satan instigated the scheme in order to rid the earth of those who preserve the knowledge of the true God."

6. "The same masterful mind that plotted against the faithful in ages past, is still seeking to rid the earth of those who fear God and keep His law."

7. According to custom, lots were cast to determine the time for the destruction of the Jews. The lots were cast in the first month of the year to select, according to their superstitious ideas, a propitious and fortunate day for the massacre of the Jews. While Haman no doubt would have been glad to have their destruction take place at an earlier date, he thought himself bound to submit to the "Pur" or lot. Perhaps this was a providence of God in delaying the execution of the Jews, and give a chance for the nature of the plot to be learned and a counter-edict issued.

8. "Church and state are now making preparations for the future conflict. Protestants are working in disguise to bring Sunday to the front, as did the Romanists. Throughout the land, the papacy is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions are to be repeated." "While men are sleeping, Satan is actively arranging matters so that the Lord's people may not have mercy or justice. The Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement, do not themselves see whither the current is tending."

9. "Men of position and reputation will join with the lawless and the vile to take counsel against the people of God." To secure popularity and patronage, legislators will yield to the demand for a Sunday law."
