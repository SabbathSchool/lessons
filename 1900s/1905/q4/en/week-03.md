### Notes

The Lord was long-suffering, and gave the Amalekites over four hundred years to reform before He commanded Saul to destroy them; but they clung to the same nature. They were ever ready to raise their hand against the poor and weak. Haman inherited all the evil tendencies of his race, and developed the most diabolical scheme of which we have any record. If God Himself had not interfered in behalf of His people, every child of God would have been destroyed in one fatal day. Esther 3:13.
