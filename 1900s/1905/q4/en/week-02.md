### Notes

1. From Mordecai's living in a palace, we might infer that he occupied some place of trust at this time. The marginal date for the book of Esther is incorrect. It was formerly thought that Ahasuerus of this book was Darius I. and the marginal date was made to correspond. The reign of Xerxes was between 486 and 465 B.C. The third year of his reign would therefore begin in 483 B.C. Mordecai was the great grandson of Kish, the Benjaminite who had been carried away into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar.

2. Mordecai realized his obligation as a father to care for Esther. He did not throw off responsibility when Esther was taken to the palace, but for one whole year every day, he went to the palace to inquire "how Esther did, and what should become of her."

3. In this, Esther revealed her home training; her wants were simple; she was content with what was given her. Oh, that all maidens could only realize that there is no ornament to compare with youthful beauty, when combined with grace of character! Esther's beauty was consecrated. Beauty of the face and person is a valuable ornament, and aids in one's usefulness when it is consecrated to God. Consecrated beauty never makes the possessor vain.

4. The "gate" was an official seat, a court where decisions were rendered, as shown by the following quotations: "Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates." Zech. 8:16. "They hate him that rebuketh in the gate. . . . They take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right. . . . [But God said] Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph." Amos 5:10-15. See Ruth 4; Job 31:21; Prov. 1:21; 22:22, etc.

5. Mordecai taught Esther to obey when she was a child, and being "trained," when old she continued to obey. A father that has wisdom to properly train his child will ever be her best counselor.

"We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field."
