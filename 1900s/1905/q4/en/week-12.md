### Notes

1. "Through two great errors—the immortality of the soul, and Sunday sacredness—Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome."—Great Controversy, page 588.

2. "The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of Spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power, and under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome, in trampling on the right of conscience."—Great Controversy, Page 588.

3. "The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we shall be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and solitary places."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, page 464.

4. "As the decree issued by the various rulers of Christendom against commandment keepers shall withdraw the protection of government, and abandon them to those who desire their destruction, the people of God will flee from the cities and villages, and associate together in companies, dwelling in the most desolate and solitary places."—Great Controversy, pages 625, 626. Also read Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, pages 464, 465.

5. "The members of the church should individually hold themselves and all their possessions upon the altar of God. Now, as never before, the Saviour's admonition is applicable: 'Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.' . . . Those who are fastening their means in large houses, in lands, in worldly enterprises, are saying by their actions, 'God can not have it: I want it for myself.' They have bound up their one talent in a napkin and hid it in the earth. There is cause for such to be alarmed."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, page 465.

6. "Satan will, if possible, prevent them (the people of God) from obtaining a preparation to stand in that day. He will so arrange affairs as to hedge up their way, entangle them with earthly treasure, cause them to carry a heavy, wearisome burden, that their hearts may be overcharged with the cares of this life, and the day of trial may come upon them as a thief."—Great Controversy, page 625.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest."
