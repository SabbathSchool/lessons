### Notes

1. "Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth."—Great Controversy, page 592.

2. The value of the Hebraic, Assyrian, and Babylonian talent, according to the Century and Standard dictionaries, was from $1,550 to $2,000. Estimating on this basis the sum of "ten thousand talents of silver" offered by Haman would be from $15,500,000 to $20,000,000. The above authorities state, however, that "reliable authorities differ greatly as to all talent values."

3. "Wealth, genius, education, will combine to cover them (Sabbath-keepers) with contempt."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, page 450.

4. "The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, persuade or compel all classes to honor the Sunday."—Great Controversy, Chap. 36, last paragraph.

5. "The decree which is to go forth against the people of God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews in the time of Esther."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, Page 540.

6. "By the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy, in violation of the law of God, our nation will disconnect herself fully from righteousness . . . this apostasy [will] be a sign to us, that the limit of God's forbearance is reached, that the measure of our nation's iniquity is full, and that the angel of mercy is about to take her flight, never to return." —Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, page 451.

"Prayerfully consider the unentered fields."
