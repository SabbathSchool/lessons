# LESSON 13.—REVIEW

## December 29, 1900

(Galatians 3 and 4.)

The length of time we have been studying the first four chapters of Galatians, gives us an average of four verses of the epistle each week. Since it is the book itself that we have been studying, and our attention is supposed to have been riveted to the text first of all, it surely ought not to be too much to expect that even those with the least time, and who are the least accustomed to study, should have these four chapters firmly fixed in their minds. It is these weaker ones that have been constantly kept in view in the preparations of the lessons. The aim has been to have them so short and simple that none could have any reasonable excuse for not learning them. Yet the book is so deep, so rich and full, that the most active minds can find an abundance of material for study in every lesson. It is not what we have been over, but what we retain and can carry with us, that does us good; so all earnest students will welcome a halting place, where they can take a brief survey of the work done. The following questions, which are not designed to take the place of any questions the live teacher may ask, will suggest more topics that can be gone into in detail in an hour, but it is taken for granted that the details have already been sufficiently considered to enable the student to summarize. The answer to every question may be found in the text, or in some portion of Scripture that has been given a prominent place by the side of the text.
