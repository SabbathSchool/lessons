# LESSON 7.â€”REVIEW

## November 17, 1900

Having studied the whole of the third chapter of Galatians, it will be well to pause and take a comprehensive view of it. As a preliminary step, however, read carefully through the first two chapters, so as to have clearly in mind the foundation of the third. If you can read and think through those chapters without the book in your hand, so much the better. Then read the third chapter through as a whole several times, noting carefully the connection of all the various parts as you pass along. The following questions may serve as a guide to the study, and may be suggestive of many more. Be careful, however, not to wander off into speculation. It is not by wandering, not by dreaming, or fancying, or guessing, that we arrive at an understanding of the Sacred Word, but by meditating upon it. Consider what it says, and the Lord will give you understanding.
