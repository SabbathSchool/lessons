# LESSON 1.—THE CURSE OF THE LAW

## October 6, 1900

(Gal. 3:3-10, R. V.)

"He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. Know therefore that they which be of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one which continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them."

For the sake of the connection, this lesson includes three verses of the preceding lesson, taking only three in advance. The earnest student will be glad of this opportunity to get the verses already passed over more firmly fixed in mind, and will find the lesson sufficiently long to occupy all the time and thought he can bestow upon it. Let us put a few questions to it; examine the text closely, and see how it answers them.

## QUESTIONS

1. How is the Spirit ministered, and by what means are miracles worked? Is it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? What is the obvious answer?
2. With whose experience is the ministering of the Spirit and the working of miracles identical?
3. How did Abraham get righteousness?
4. Who then are the children of Abraham?
5. What was foreseen in the Scriptures?
6. What, therefore, was done?
7. In what words was the Gospel preached to Abraham?
8. Of what was the preaching of the Gospel to Abraham a proof?
9. Who, then, are blessed? With whom are they blessed?
10. Who are cursed?
11. Why are they cursed who are of the works of the law?
12. What, then, would be their condition if they should do, and continue to do, all things written in the law?

## NOTES

1. "They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham." Abraham is the father of all them that believe, whether they be circumcised or uncircumcised. Rom. 4:11. No one, no matter of what nation or people, will enter heaven except as the child of Abraham. The faithful followers of Christ are the real seed of Abraham.

2. From the very beginning, long before the days of Abraham, it was foreseen that God would justify the heathen through faith. Faith is the only possible means of salvation; and unless it was the heathen who were justified by it, no one on earth could be justified, since all were heathen. In the fall of Adam, all men became heathen—wanderers from the one true God.

3. The preaching of the Gospel to Abraham was the proof that God would justify the heathen through faith; for Abraham was born a heathen. "The father of Abraham and the father of Nachor" "served other gods." Joshua 24:2. The very existence of the Jewish nation, therefore, and their separation from the nations of earth, was a standing witness to the fact that it was God's plan to save as many heathen as would believe.

4. The Gospel was preached to Abraham in the words, "In thee shall all nations be blessed." If you wish to know what this blessing is, read Rom. 4:1-9. It is the blessing of forgiveness of sin. It is the blessing of the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ. This blessing has come upon all men, for "as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of One the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life." Rom. 5:18. What a pity that all will not take the gift thus freely bestowed!

5. All, however, who believe, who "are of faith," that is, of faith alone—not faith and works, but faith which works—are blessed with faithful Abraham. Righteousness—right-doing, obedience to the law—comes by faith alone, and not by any works of law done by man. Christ is not dead in vain. See Gal. 2:21. Whoever would be justified by his own obedience is seeking to frustrate the grace of God, and to prove that it was not necessary for Christ to die. Every such attempt will fail.

6. Since they who are of faith are blessed, it follows that they who are of works are cursed, else God would be denying Himself. What is the matter with the law? Is it not good?—Oh, yes; it is all right! "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Rom. 7:12. Then why is the one who does it under the curse?—He is not. Here is where so many stumble in their reading. It is written, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." This is of itself proof that the law is good, and that "blessed are they that do His commandments." If men did, and continued to do, all things that are written in the law, they would be blessed.

7. But "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23. "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Rom. 8:7. Therefore it is that "by the works of the law there shall no flesh be justified" (Rom. 3:20), and as many as seek justification by it are under the curse. Note that not only the wilful transgressors, but even the seekers after righteousness, if they seek it by their own works, are under the curse. Yet some will be blessed. Yes; "they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," because faith works by love, and love is the fulfilling of the law. We are made righteous by faith, and by faith are we kept righteous. "The just shall live by faith."
