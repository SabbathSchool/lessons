# Christ's Object Lessons
By MRS. E. G. WHITE

At this time (Aug. 20), it is expected that the above-mentioned book will be copyrighted in England and the United States Oct. 1, 1900.

As the most of our readers are aware, this is the volume dedicated to the lifting of the indebtedness of our educational institutions; i.e., all the royalties of the author, the profits of the publishers and tract societies, together with nearly all the profits of the canvassers, will be applied on this debt, in addition to which the publishers donate the cost of labor in manufacturing the books.

It will be a book which should be in every home. It will treat upon the parables with which our Saviour emphasized his sermons, and will be fully illustrated, largely with scenes from nature. It will contain about 440 pages; and, on account of the donation on the part of the publishers and tract societies, will retail for only

**$1.25**

# A NEWLY ILLUSTRATED EDITION OF

## THOUGHTS FROM THE MOUNT OF BLESSING

Before issuing editions of this soul-inspiring volume in England and Australia, as well as in several foreign languages, it was thought best to prepare an entirely new series of illustrations which will more faithfully emphasize the beauties of the text.

These engravings have been carefully prepared and the entire book has been reset, and is now ready for sale. Much finer paper has been used in the new edition, and it is now one of the most attractively gotten up small books published by the denomination.

We have shipped sets of plates to the Echo Publishing Co., Melbourne, Australia; International Tract Society, Limited, London, England; and to the Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Mich. These houses will publish the book for their respective fields.

Price remains the same as before

The regular price of this booklet is 25 cents, and the imperfection in the lot is so slight that but few will notice it. This price will be given only in the above-mentioned way.

A subscriber to this Library is entitled to six different numbers of the Library. During the past year these six numbers aggregated 79 cents, yet our subscribers have gotten it all for 25 cents. We can not say what will be issued in this series the coming year, but it will be carefully selected literature that will repay your subscription price.

Sabbath-School officers, teachers, and students who have purchased that excellent little book,

# THE GLAD TIDINGS

If not, allow us to say that it is the best help to the study of the book of Galatians ever published. Neither is it a book that will be used only during this series of lessons, but it will always be valuable for study and reference.

# Power for Witnessing

Is the title of a forthcoming book by Eld. A. F. Ballenger, of which one of our leading laborers, after reading the proofs, said

> "One beautiful thing about this book is that IT'S ALIVE"

That conclusion is emphatically true, as everyone who has had the privilege of reading a single chapter will testify.

It treats upon the work of the Holy Spirit, and as one who read it said,

> "It is a BOOK OF ACTS and not a volume of resolutions"

Get it. Read it. You will thank us for recommending it to you, and in turn you will recommend it to your friends
