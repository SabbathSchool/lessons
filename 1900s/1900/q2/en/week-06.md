## READING
"Desire of Ages," chapter 87.

## NOTE
Although Jesus had told His disciples plainly that He was soon to go away, but would replace His personal presence with the Holy Spirit, they could not as yet so far divest themselves of the common idea that the Messiah was to reign a temporal king, as to anticipate with satisfaction the coming of the Holy Spirit to them. At this distance how strange it all seems, and yet they were no blinder respecting that truth than many of us now are on other important subjects.
