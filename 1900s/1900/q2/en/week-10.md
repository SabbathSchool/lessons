## NOTES

1. "They have their reward" here and now. They are looking to men, and they get what men have to give.

2. "Vain repetitions," among which would be included the names or titles of Deity repeated over and over in an irreverent form. Some prayers from really earnest persons would seem blasphemous in cold print. The name of Deity is used as one would use the name of a common man in a narrative. Our Lord forbids this, and enjoins reverence.

3. Not the Lord's prayer, but a model prayer which Jesus taught His people for all ages. Note how much it includes: (1) The address; (2) our relationship to Him; (3) our needs; (4) our character and relation to our fellows; (5) our future safety, with the closing ascription, omitted from the Revised Version, but eminently scriptural. "Father" is the home name, an affectionate and an endearing relation; "our Father," implying brothers and sisters and uniting in one family all God's children. "Hallowed," holy should the name and character of God be regarded. This could not be done without becoming like Him.

4. "Thy kingdom come." Where?â€”Here, and, first of all, in our own hearts. No man ever truly prays the prayer if he does not submit to God's law and desire that God shall rule supreme in his life. It must be personal, "Thy will be done" in me in the earth.

5. "Our daily bread," spiritual as well as physical. Man thinks he must eat daily of physical food to maintain strength and vigor. Is not daily feeding upon the Word as necessary for moral strength and vigor? "Manna from heaven falls fresh every eve" for God's people now as well as anciently.
