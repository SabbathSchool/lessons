2. Where is a safe place of deposit? Verse 20.

## NOTES

1. The body, with its passions, is naturally dark; its light comes alone through the eye. The single, clear eye gives correct ideas. The perverted eye distorts all outward things to the dark body. So if our spiritual vision is single (seeking only God's glory), clear (trusting Him as He declares Himself to be), His light will flood the soul and enlighten the dark body. But if this vision is perverted by sin and selfishness, it will further pervert the naturally base passions and make blacker the natural darkness within.

2. The word "therefore" shows this verse to be a conclusion from verses previous. Jesus anticipated that souls would be tempted to believe that we can not get clothing or food unless we serve the world or ourselves. His effort in all this instruction is to lead men to the higher service alone, that of God. Whatever we do, do it as unto God, and leave results with Him. "Take no thought," is better expressed in the Revised Version, "Be not anxious." The word means anxious, troubled, worried thought. So also in verses 27, 28, 31, 34.

3. "Consider the lilies;" they teach many lessons. Growing in the soil or decay of earth, they turn their faces to the light, and God through them transmutes the base soil of earth into glorious beauty. So let God's will be the first, and our character will adorn whatever physical clothes God may in His providence give.

4. It is the Gentiles, nations of the world, who seek such things, whose hopes are only temporal, earthly. The children of God should have higher objects.

5. This lesson does not in any way indorse laziness. The Christian will be diligent and industrious. Rom. 12:11; 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:10-12.

6. Borrow no evil of the future. God gives us today strength for today's duties, trials, sorrows, evils. We can borrow no grace for future troubles. How foolish it is, then, to borrow a trouble which we can not meet! The day brings sufficient evil and care, but there is always grace for the day. God is a present help in trouble.
