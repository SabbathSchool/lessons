# A RE-VIEW

This man is re-viewing the road up which he has been traveling. The points of mere passing interest have now faded away, but the truly important objects stand out the more sharply in consequence. From among these important objects, he is now in a position to decide which are the greater, and these he will ever in his memory.

The time has now come that we should thus re-view the Sabbath-school lessons, and the question at once arises in the minds of many, "Where can I get a complete bird's-eye view of the whole series of lessons on the Life of Christ—a help that will so strongly impress the more important truths upon my mind and heart that I will never forget them?"

To this question the minds of experienced teachers have but one answer, that is "THE DESIRE OF AGES."

Its appropriate subject and chapter titles; its complete scripture and subject index; and its clear, beautiful and forcible illustrations all combine to make it not only a help to the student but a photographed re-view of these grand lessons as well—a photograph which may be carried with you until its objects of interest are all fixed in the mind.

In view of the vital importance of these lessons, we firmly believe that no family can afford to be without the help this wonderful volume affords.

Remember the trade edition can be purchased for $1.50 in cloth, and $2.00 in full leather binding, and that this edition contains all the reading matter of the larger book. Order from your Tract Society.

## DO YOU KNOW?

Do you know why the circulation of The Life Boat has increased from four hundred and ninety (490) in its first issue to seventeen thousand (17,000) at the close of its second year's existence? Do you know why one sister sent in an order for eleven hundred (1100) copies of one issue to sell in her community? Certainly not because of advertising or any other human effort put forth to extend its circulation.

Do you know why hundreds of prisoners behind the bars count the days when they will receive the next issue of The Life Boat? If you don't know, send four cents in stamps for a sample copy, and if you find something in it that makes your soul thrill with a divine joy, then give it to your neighbor after you have read it. Published monthly. Illustrated.

Subscription price 25 cents a year.

We have issued an attractive booklet, printed in two colors, and entitled "The Little Foxes Destroy the Vines."

It emphasizes the fact that it was the "Little Foxes"—not the large ones—that did the damage, and applies the principle to the care we take of our bodies.

It explains how fully this principle is developed in some of our recent books.

## CHRISTIAN PATRIOTISM

The subject of the union of church and state becomes more interesting as the days go by for a great prophecy upon the subject is being most marvelously fulfilled before us. We need to be on the right side of this question, and to KNOW that we are right.

The Bible is the infallible guide upon the subject. But have you studied the Bible so that you can tell what it teaches upon this important topic? Whether you have or not you ought to watch for the forthcoming pamphlet, from the pen of Elder A. T. Jones, entitled "Christian Patriotism." It reviews this question in an entirely original way. It is written in clear, concise language that is easy to be understood. One who has read the manuscript says that he was so interested in it that he did not want to lay it down till he had finished it. It contains principles that are vital for this time. Get a copy just as soon as you can, and study it carefully. You will not only be deeply interested, but as you are reading it you will recognize that you are being wonderfully benefited.

### The Pacific Health Journal Should be in every home

The Creator intended that man should continually enjoy good health and be crowned with long life.

Evil has marred God's glorious plan.

But God is revealing to his people the royal road back to health and happiness.

The Pacific Health Journal is devoted to the presentation of this Gospel of Health.

Its purpose is to show mankind how to restore health and how to live healthfully in God's way.

This is why our Health Journal should be found in every Christian home.

## A 10,000 Edition

The S.S. Lessons for the last half of this year will be on the Epistle to the Galatians.

The lesson writer, Dr. E. J. Waggoner, has also prepared a help to accompany them, the MS. for which has been recently received and examined by the Sabbath-school Officers and our Publishing Committee.

They found this MS. so extremely clear and interesting, and so filled with the genuine Gospel Spirit that they advised a first edition of 10,000 copies, which we are about to issue.

As it will be a book of extraordinary and permanent value, we urge lesson students to purchase the cloth bound edition instead of the paper.

Prices are as follows:—

| Format | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Paper | 25c |
| Cloth, strongly bound | 60c |

The title will be THE GLAD TIDINGS
