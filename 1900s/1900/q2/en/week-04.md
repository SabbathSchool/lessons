## NOTES

1. This is another illustration of the fact that in obeying the Lord's commands there follows a reward which meets the demand of the hour. When the Lord said to the nobleman, "Go thy way; thy son liveth," on returning home he found his heart's desire. When Jesus out on the deep sea said to Peter, "Come," obedience to the command provided power with which to walk on the water. The law of friendship with Christ is still the same. John 15:14. To obey implicitly is the first step into the Lord's confidence, and toward final reward.

2. It seems strange that the other disciples did not recognize Christ, as did John. But as soon as Peter was told that the apparent stranger was the Lord, his old-time enthusiasm seized him. How like many of today, who do not of themselves discern the Lord in His dealings toward them, but have to be told by others that it is He, before they manifest any interest in the Lord's presence!

3. This question was to refresh Peter's mind regarding what he had said on the night of the betrayal, that, although all the other disciples should deny the Lord, he never would; that he loved Him enough to go to prison or to death with Him, even though the other disciples should forsake Him. So the Lord reminds us frequently, after our failures, of our boasted love, not by direct reference to the boasts made, but by some other test which will cause us to reflect on the failures.

4. Peter seemed to feel by the repetition of this question that Jesus doubted his love, and that he was being placed in a wrong light before his brethren. But the Lord was simply trying to impress upon him a lesson of human weakness, and the necessity of dependence upon divine strength in order to carry out the trust about to be committed to him. As Peter had thrice denied the Lord, after professing more love for the Lord than his brethren possessed, so three times the grave question was asked, "Lovest thou Me more than these?" Oh, that we might learn this important lesson before, by word or deed, we deny the Lord once, even, in the presence of His enemies!

5. This change is remarkable because it shows that Christ not only distinguished between the older and younger members of His body, but that He in this case called attention to the younger ones first, indicating that they should find a prominent place in the labors of those who work for the Master. It is also remarkable that the word "feed," used in verses 16 and 17, comes from two different originals. The one in verse 17 means to give pasture, and the other conveys the sense of tending as a shepherd. Not only then were the flock to be fed, but also tended, and cared for in every need.

6. So it is now; many take their eyes from their own work, to watch the course of others, as though it were a part of their duty to know all the particulars of a fellow-laborer's calling. But the answer to Peter's question is a good one now for all inquisitive ones, "What is that to thee? follow thou Me."

7. This is an illustration of how unsafe it is to draw deductions from what the Lord says, and make them the basis of a belief. The admonition of Paul to Timothy, "Consider what I say," is worthy of much consideration in these days of speculation as to the meaning of plain statements in God's Word.
