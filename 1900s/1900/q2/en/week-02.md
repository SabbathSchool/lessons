## NOTES

1. It seems from the conversation that these disciples were anxiously desirous to learn, if possible, what these events all meant to their hopes of their future. Jesus did then as He does now for every anxious inquirer,—draw near to give them that for which their soul longed,—a knowledge of His plan of salvation.

2. The English word "fools" as represented to have been used by the Saviour on this occasion was not one expressing lack of sense, but rather a gentle reproof for their forgetfulness of Scripture declarations that they had been taught to cherish, which, if remembered, would have saved them from their perplexity. The sense of the text would have been as well preserved had it been translated, "O thoughtless man." The Revised Version reads, "O foolish men."

3. They "constrained" Him, that is, pressed Him beyond measure. They had not been satisfied with His brief words so cheering, but urged His presence. This desire for His presence caused Him to tarry with them, and gave Him opportunity to make Himself known to them. Their experience in this line may be ours, and will be when we become as importunate as they.
