## NOTES

1. Evidently the women were at first sight somewhat startled at the brightness of the Lord's messenger, but his assuring words gave them comfort. This incident well illustrates the surety of God's promise that when terror overtakes the wicked, it will not come nigh those who make the Lord their fortress. Ps. 91:1-8. This was especially true in the case of the women, to whom the angel said, "I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."

2. After Peter's cowardly denial of the Lord on the night of His betrayal, this word to send the message direct to Peter was an assurance that the Lord had already forgiven his wicked act. It is also one of the strong evidences of the Lord's long-suffering toward those who now commit folly under great temptation.

3. From this statement of the Saviour it is very evident that the thief did not ascend to the Father with Jesus on the day of the crucifixion. See Luke 23:43. The "to-day" of the promise must therefore refer to the time of making the promise, rather than to the time of its fulfillment. This would naturally be read from the text were the comma after the word "thee" to follow the next word, which might be done without violence to inspiration, since punctuation points are no part of inspiration, but a modern invention.
