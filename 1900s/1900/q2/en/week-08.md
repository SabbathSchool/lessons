# LESSON 1 - THE BEATITUDES
May 26, 1900

(Matt. 5:1-16; compare Luke 6:20-27)

**NOTE** — It is quite impossible in six lessons to adequately cover a portion of Scripture consisting of 111 verses, in which many times a single verse contains suggestion for an hour's study; but as not even one whole lesson was given to this interesting portion of our Lord's teaching when we passed over the early part of the Gospels, it was thought both proper and profitable to use the last six lessons in this quarter in the further study of this wonderful sermon. What a blessing it would be if those who study these lessons would commit these three chapters to memory!

For the one "help" above all others, apart from the Word, "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," and chapter 16 in "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2, are recommended.

11. What should the righteous do under such treatment? What assurance have they? Who have thus suffered before them? Verse 12.

12. To what does Jesus liken His disciples? Of what good is salt which has lost its preserving power? What becomes of it, as well as the thing designed to be preserved by it? Verse 13.

## NOTES

1. The location of the Mount of Beatitudes (the meaning of which is blessings) is not certainly known. It is somewhere near the Sea of Galilee. The Lord would have us mind the teachings, not the mountain. The instruction was spoken first of all to His disciples gathered around Him, and beyond them to the great multitude eager to hear. They are written for us upon whom the ends of the world are come.

2. It will be noticed by the careful student that these "blesseds" (or "happys") are pronounced not upon special classes who are naturally humble, meek, pure, etc., but upon dispositions which every soul by grace may acquire. In fact, each "blessed" marks a step forward and upward in Christian character; they are telescopic, so to speak, all of them being contained in the truly humble, or "poor in spirit." The thoroughness of the first step will mark the degree and rapidity of progress in the subsequent steps. The very beginning of Christian character is to have a sense of one's own utter unworthiness and nothingness apart from God. This is to acquiesce in what God says to us in such scriptures as Jer. 17:9; Rev. 3:17. Neither are the blessings and promises all to be put off to the future. God gives the "earnest" of the very greatest of them here.

3. Hunger and thirst are longings for that which will meet our needs. Every longing desire for something satisfying to heart and soul is from God; its perversion to evil things is of Satan. Both hunger and thirst become strong passions, sometimes breaking through and overruling every other sentiment. But only one thing can meet the soul's longing,—Christ.

4. "The pure in heart" see God even here as do no others. They see Him in all His created works, marred though they are by sin. They see Him in His Word. In that better, sinless world, "they shall see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads." Rev. 22:4.
