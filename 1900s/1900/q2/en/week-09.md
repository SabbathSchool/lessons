## NOTES

1. Jesus came to fulfil, or fill up, both prophets and law. To fulfil the prophets is to be and accomplish what they predict. This will not be done till the new heavens and earth are ushered in. Law can be fulfilled only by doing it. Fulfilling prophecy makes it history. But fulfilling law can not, in the very nature of things, destroy or abolish the law. See Gal. 6:2. Christ by doing, obeying, the law showed it to be honorable, and His teaching magnified it by bringing out its spirituality. Isa. 42:21. Now one jot (yod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew) or tittle (a small point of a letter which served to distinguish one letter from another) "shall in nowise pass from the law till all things be accomplished" (R. V.), till the new heavens and the new earth in their glorious eternity shall have passed away. Isa. 51:6, 7.

2. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees in Christ's time was a mere outward observance of external forms. It was literally "the righteousness of the law," doing the outward thing because the law said so, not because love prompted it. This might gain the praise of men, but it would never be a passport to the kingdom of God, either here or hereafter.

3. Not "by them of old time," but, as in the margin and Revised Version, "to them of old time." Jesus did not condemn the law, but desired that His disciples should know its depth.

4. All this was in the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill." The greater sin includes all despising, all contempt, all hatred, which would lead to murder. "Without cause," the R.V. omits. "Raca," an expression of contempt; "thou fool" (Hebrew Moreh), an expression of condemnation; "hell fire," "fire of Gehenna."

5. Not only must we cherish no hatred, but we must do what we can to remove our brother's estrangement if we know such exists. But here great wisdom is needed. Before going to another, we should have good evidence that he really holds a grievance. Too often it is the case that he who would carry out the Saviour's instruction imagines that some one holds aught against him, and thus, because of the many occasions, is kept constantly at work trying to make peace with his brethren. But no effort should be spared, where one is known to be seriously out of harmony with us, to remove, if possible, the cause of separation. If we are sinning against God, the law is our adversary. Agree with it before it is too late.

6. Adultery includes the cherishing of lustful thoughts. If our thoughts are pure, our words and acts will be pure. Unchaste language, words and expressions that suggest evil thoughts, should be scrupulously avoided. They are corrupting in their influence upon others, and give evidence of a corrupt heart; "for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Matt. 12:34.

7. "Causeth thee to stumble," of the Revised Version, is plainer than "offend thee." We should be willing to sacrifice what is as dear as the right hand or right eye, rather than sin against God. He wants the whole man clean. What is true of the individual is true of the church. Matt. 18:8, 9; 1 Cor. 5:6, 7.
