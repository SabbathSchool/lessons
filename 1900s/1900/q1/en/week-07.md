## NOTES

1. It is a remarkable thing that, in the midst of all His danger, Jesus did not for a moment forget to care for His disciples, and so the only favor asked of His captors was that His disciples might retain their liberty.

2. Annas had been appointed high priest in A.D. 7, by the Emperor Quirinius, but because of his constant intrigue and unwearied plottings, was deprived of his office in A.D. 14, by Valerius. He, however, had the privilege of seeing his five sons successively raised to the same office. Caiaphas, being son-in-law to Annas, gave way to the influence of the latter to such an extent that the father-in-law really ruled matters in the office of high priest.
