## NOTES

1. The fact that all the notables of the Jewish church were assembled at the house of the high priest awaiting the arrival of the prisoner, shows that the plan of His capture and trial was well understood, and carried out to the letter.

2. Peter evidently played a false part. In mingling with the servants, he sought to hide his identity. In this effort he placed himself on Satan's ground, and subjected himself to unnecessary temptation. Had he remained with John, and not tried to appear a disinterested spectator of the all-absorbing affair, those present would have known his relations to Christ without a question. But when the questions were asked him in a way to show contempt for his Master, Peter was not fortified. From this instance we can learn that it is better to let our true colors be displayed from the first.

3. This is but an example of how wicked men can pervert the words of another in order to prove a case. How careful we should be, therefore, in stating the words of another!
