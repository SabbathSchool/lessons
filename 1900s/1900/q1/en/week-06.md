## NOTES

1. The three disciples thus taken to the interior of the garden, to there witness Christ's passion, had also been the chosen witnesses of His transfiguration. Of all others, these alone were permitted to behold the power of Christ in raising the ruler's daughter from the dead. Luke 8:51.

2. In this trying hour, where all the agony of His life was culminated, Jesus evidently desired these beloved disciples near, just the same as we desire the presence of dear friends in our great struggles with spiritual foes. Besides, He was desirous that they might witness in the soul agony which drew the bloody sweat from His face, something of the love wherewith He had loved them, that they might be prepared to go forth to the world enabled to proclaim that love in its fullness.

3. Had Peter overcome the power of darkness specially manifested during the season of agony endured by Christ, he would have been fortified against the temptation which Christ knew would surely follow His arrest in the garden that night. But, like many now whom the Lord would prepare to stand in the great temptation soon to come upon all the world (Rev. 3:10), he lost the necessary power to withstand the trial by letting his will-power be controlled by a weakness of the flesh. See, again, Matt. 26:41.
