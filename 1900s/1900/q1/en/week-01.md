## NOTES

1. In eating the Passover the participants seated themselves at a table, and the question of place or position would naturally arise, and if several had a desire for the place of honor, or first place, and expressed it, strife would surely result. This explains how the strife arose which is mentioned in Luke 22:24, and this was followed by the instruction recorded in verses 25-30, and the example of humility and the teaching of Christ found in John 13:1-20. This precious instruction, accompanied by the Saviour's example in washing His disciples' feet, was designed to give them a correct view of true greatness, and prepare them for the service which was to follow.

2. It may be noted that the basin, the water, and the towel were all at hand as necessary parts of the Passover accompaniments. The two disciples sent ahead to make arrangements for the celebration of that feast, without specific instruction, provided the bread, the wine, the water, the towels, and all the vessels used on that occasion.

THE SURPLUS DONATIONS during the present quarter will be used in the most needy foreign fields.
