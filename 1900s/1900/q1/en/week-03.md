## NOTES

1. At first thought it seemed strange that, with so long a tutelage under the Saviour Himself, so many should have quibbled about how His promises were to be fulfilled. Yet many to-day are almost, if not quite, as dull students as they, notwithstanding great opportunities for present enlightenment. Their difficulty arose from a gross misconception of the nature of Christ's rule, supposing it to be an earthly reign upon the Jewish throne, after the fashion of worldly kings, while many now, though having discarded that view, mistake the nature of Christ's reign in the heart, and so doubt His ability or purpose to fulfill His promise of power, because the heart is not fully yielded to Him, thus barring out simple faith.

2. Used in connection with what goes before it, this text shows that as Jesus only acted and spoke as the Father in Him prompted, so in His going away and leaving His disciples with the same power dwelling in them that had moved Him in everything, they ought to rejoice in the thought of having the power direct from One who is above all. It is, therefore, the privilege of every believer to have the same power dwelling within him by which Jesus moved, spoke, and did the miracles that characterized Him as the Son of God. This is what the reception of the Holy Ghost in its fullness will do for every child of God. Its reception is not a mere theory, but a blessed condition, through which God works to reveal to the world the mysteries of His kingdom, that the sinner may choose its reign as infinitely superior to that of Satan's. See John 14:12.
