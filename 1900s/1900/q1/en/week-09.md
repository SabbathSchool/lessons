## NOTES

1. The decision of the meeting at the house of Caiaphas was of no binding force. The charge of blasphemy there decided against Christ must have a legal decision from the council of the nation in order to convert it into a charge of treason, and so hold the prisoner in the meshes of the civil law. Jesus is, therefore, hurried into the presence of the national council as soon as its members can be gotten together.

2. It must have been humiliating for Judas, hard as he was, to go before the very persons to whom he had shortly before shown himself willing to sell his Master, and there confess that he had betrayed an innocent person. What a lesson for those now who so readily become accusers of their brethren! Many such may yet have the same confession to make as did Judas, but, let us hope, with some prospect of correcting the wrong.
