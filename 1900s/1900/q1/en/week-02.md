## NOTES

1. The Passover had more significance than merely to point to the death of Christ as a sacrifice for sin. Its very name is derived from the act of the avenging angel passing over God's people in Egypt—those who had the blood of the sacrificial lamb on their door-posts—when the first-born of the rebellious Egyptians were being slain. As the deliverance of Israel from Egypt to dwell in the promised land was a type of the final deliverance of God's people to inherit the land promised to Abraham's seed, so the fulfillment of the Passover will not be complete until God's people reach the final consummation.

2. It seemed necessary to indicate beforehand the definite course matters were to take, in order to confirm the disciples in their faith, and so fortify them against the heresy that all these events were accidental. Christ wished His disciples to understand that He knew the hearts of all men. John 2:25.

3. The Passover lamb which they had just eaten was a type of Christ, and would meet its antitype when He should expire on the cross. The Lord's Supper, which was then instituted, in which they partook of the bread and the fruit of the vine, was to continue until the fulfillment of the mission of Christ. When He comes the second time, and gathers His disciples around the board at the "marriage supper of the Lamb," then Christ will drink of the new fruit of the vine with His disciples, in the kingdom of God. Matt. 26:29.
