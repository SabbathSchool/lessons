# Recent Publications
*Issued by the Pacific Press Publishing Company*

## The Desire of Ages

Ever since the publication of the large subscription edition of this remarkable book, there has been a call for a smaller copy without illustrations and at a low price. Just such a book was issued October 30, 1899.

It contains all the reading matter of the subscription book, including the exhaustive Scriptural and General Indexes, but no illustrations except a frontispiece. Its size is 5 x 7½ inches; its pages, 1042. It is a "trade book," that is, it is not subject to a subscription book discount to agents. The prices are as follows: Cloth, $1.50; Full Leather, round corners, $2.00.

## A Friend in the Kitchen

The object of this book is to help people to discard a harmful diet by presenting before them a better one. This is well done in a series of about 400 carefully selected and tested recipes, into the preparation of which flesh meats do not enter. In addition to being a practical cook-book, it contains much valuable information about foods, food combinations, food values, time necessary to digest various foods, etc., which will be appreciated by every housewife. It is well bound in waterproof cloth. Price, 60c.

## Pagan Counterfeits in the Christian Church

It may be hard to believe that there are really anti-Christian beliefs cherished by the Church to-day, but a perusal of this intensely interesting pamphlet will convince a candid mind that such is the case. In addition to this, the author treats upon Papacy and Masonry in a way that is well calculated to awaken people to the danger to this country in the stealthy tread of the former, and to the baneful influence of the latter. 187 pages. Price, 25 cents.

## The Seal of God and Its Counterfeit

Has the Lord a seal or an outward sign by which His true followers may be known? If so, what is it? Has Satan prepared a mark intended to counterfeit that seal? If so, what is it? These important questions form the basis of the 32-page illustrated tract, title of which is given above. It deserves careful study and wide circulation at this time when the counterfeit seal is being so generally accepted as the genuine. Price, $2.00 per 100.

## The Return of the Jews

There are many scriptures which clearly indicate that there will be a class of people attracted to some one portion of the earth, and the object of this tract is to determine the class to which reference is made. The present agitation concerning the return of the Jews to Palestine makes peculiarly appropriate this excellent exposition of the subject. 32 pages, illustrated. Price, $2.00 per 100.

## Natural Food of Man

The increasing demand for a scriptural setting forth of the principles connected with the natural diet of man, together with a series of recipes enabling the user to dispense not only with meat but all animal productions such as butter, milk, eggs, etc., as well, has brought this most excellent little pamphlet into the field. It is divided into three parts. Part One is written by the editor of the Signs of the Times, under the heading, "Man's Primitive and Best Diet." Part Two, by Mrs. Flora Leadsworth, gives directions for the preparation of more than 150 thoroughly hygienic dishes. Part Three, by J. R. Leadsworth, M. D., treats upon "Food for the Sick." 96 pages. Price, 25 cents.

## Jesus Died for You

A sweet-spirited invitation to Christless souls to consecrate themselves to their Saviour without delay. Especially good for mission work, in that it is easily understood, is brief, and breathes forth a message warm from the Throne of Love. 8 pages, illustrated cover. Price, 50 cents per 100.

For any of the foregoing publications address your Tract Society or any of the offices of the Pacific Press or Review and Herald Publishing Companies

# Publications Soon to Appear

## A Sabbath-School Lesson Help

Commencing with next July and continuing for six months or longer, our Sabbath-school lessons will be on the book of Galatians. These lessons are being prepared by Elder E. J. Waggoner, who is also writing a pamphlet to accompany them. In addition to being a great help to the lesson student, this pamphlet also promises to be of permanent value and general interest. Probably ready in May or June.

## Capital and Labor

Prof. George W. Rine of Healdsburg College is preparing a tract on the subject of Capital and its connection with Labor, for publication in the Bible Students' Library. It will contain about 32 pages, and will be illustrated. In view of the importance of the subject and the able way in which it will be treated, we have faith to believe that this number will have an immense sale and accomplish much good. Price, $2.00 per 100.

## Individuality of God's Love

We have in prospect another manuscript by Professor Rine on the Individuality of God's Love, or how God cares for, and manifests Himself to, each one of His children in contradistinction to the mass. This will be issued as a number of the Apples of Gold Library.

## Salvation through Christ

Such is the title of a forthcoming number of the Apples of Gold Library, by E. J. Waggoner. Price, about 50 cents per 100.

## Christian Science

Elder A. O. Tait has been giving much study to the subject of Christian Science and kindred last-day delusions, and we hope soon to present the results of his researches in book form. It is an important group of subjects, and we look for the book to have a very large circulation. Its price will probably not exceed 50 cents, and it may be issued in paper covers also at about 25 cents.

## House We Live In

The well-known writer for children, Mrs. Vesta J. Farnsworth, has sent to us manuscript for a book on the importance of knowing the materials and functions of our own bodies. It is for home reading, and intended to assist mothers in teaching children how to care for their bodily dwelling, and the evil effects of narcotics and stimulants. A few of its twenty-six chapter titles will indicate its character better than an extended description:—

- Houses and Temples
- Our Frame
- Proper Care of the Frame
- Walls of Our House
- The Cupola
- Our Telephone System
- Our Kitchen
- Food and Fuel
- Bath Room
- How the House is Heated
- Some Wonderful Windows
- Music Room

It is all told in a dialogue form which makes it extremely interesting, while the appropriate series of illustrations now being prepared will add much to its attractiveness as a book for the children. Price, about $1.00.
