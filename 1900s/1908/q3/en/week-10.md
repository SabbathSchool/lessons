## Notes

1. There are many things here worthy of study. A systematic arrangement was made to supply all the expenses connected with the temple service. The tithe was sacredly kept for the use for which God designed it.

2. It is evident that the people so thoroughly studied the law and the worship of the sanctuary arranged by David and Solomon that they were familiar with every feature that God had ordained. It was one of the most thorough reforms of which we have any Bible record. It fitly illustrates what will finally be accomplished under the third angel's message.
