## Notes

1. The Urim and Thummim gave the direct mind of the Lord in the matter, and therefore was higher authority than the governor. Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 28:6. Read chapter 30 in "Patriarchs and Prophets."

"At the right and left of the breastplate were two large stones of great brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and Thummim. By them the will of God was made known through the high priest. When questions were brought for decision before the Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone at the right was a token of the divine consent or approval, while a cloud shadowing the stone at the left was an evidence of denial or disapprobation." â€”"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 351.

2. The Jews were engaged in a steady work of reform, and the whole plan of their enemies was to divert them from their work. First they sought to frighten the Jews, and when they would not be frightened, efforts were made to arrange a conference with them, reporting things that were not true. This conference was sought under the pretense of friendship, but war was in the hearts of their enemies continually.
