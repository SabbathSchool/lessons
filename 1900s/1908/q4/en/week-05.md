## Notes.

1. The children of two families are recognized in the Bible as "children of Belial" (Judges 20:13), "children of transgression" (Isa. 57:4), "children of the Lord" (Deut. 14:1), "children of wrath" (Eph. 2:3), "sons of God" (1 John 3:1); "children of iniquity," of "disobedience" (2 Sam. 3:34; Eph. 2:2), and "obedient children" (1 Peter 1:14; Rom. 15:18); "children of darkness" (Eph. 5:8), and "children of light" (1 Thess. 5:5); "children of the wicked one" (Matt. 13:38), and "children of God" (Luke 20:36; Rom. 8:16); "children of this world" (Luke 16:8), and "children of the kingdom" (Matt. 8:12); "children of the flesh" (Rom. 9:8), and "children of the promise" (Gal. 4:28). Of the unbelieving Jews, Christ said, "Ye are of your father, the devil" (John 8:44); but, praise God, the children of evil may through Jesus Christ become the sons and daughters of God (2 Cor. 6:14-18; John 1:12).

2. In the building of Solomon's temple every stone was prepared for its place in the building before it was brought to the place, so that beautiful temple came together without the sound of an ax or hammer upon it. The living stones for this living temple, taken from the rough quarry of sin, are hewed, squared, fitted, and polished, each for its particular place in the temple of the Lord. Unlike the stones of Solomon's temple, which had to be conveyed to the spot, of these living stones it is said, "They that are afar off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord." See Zech. 6:12, 13.

3. "Christ has made every provision that His church shall be a transformed body, illumined with the Light of the world, possessing the glory of Immanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere of light and peace. He desires that we shall reveal His own joy in our lives." â€”"Christ's Object Lessons," page 419.
