# Life and Health

This journal is published with a view of meeting the needs of every home—teaching obedience to hygienic principles in the care of health, and emphasizing individual duty in preserving life and health as long as possible.

True religion and the laws of health go hand in hand, and one of the best ways to work for the salvation of individuals is to teach them to discard sinful gratifications, which prevent spiritual things from impressing their minds.

# LIBERTY

How dear is this word "Liberty" to the heart of every loyal American. And yet how few there are in this day and age who really understand its meaning. This generation can not fully comprehend what this precious heritage has cost in human life and effort, and there is today a growing indifference to the principles of true liberty—liberty of conscience as well as liberty of action.

The journal "Liberty" stands as the exponent of perfect equality in the exercise of all God-given rights and liberties, and, first of all, the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, free from all interference on the part of civil authority. Price, 25 cents per year. Liberal terms to agents.

# WASHINGTON FOREIGN MISSION SEMINARY

"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

Realizing that the fulfilment of this prophecy rests to a great extent in the hands of those devoted workers who leave home, friends, and native land to carry the gospel, the General Conference Council at Gland, Switzerland, decided to make the College at Washington, D.C., a Special Training School for missionaries. To this end the Washington Foreign Mission Seminary is now established at Takoma Park with the definite purpose of giving volunteer missionaries a special preparation for their difficult fields. All phases of mission life are given due attention. The geographical, physical, moral, and religious conditions under which the missionary will be placed are carefully studied with reference to each individual. For detailed information address H.R. Salisbury, Pres. Foreign Mission Seminary, Takoma Park, Washington, D.C.

# THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR

This splendid little paper occupies the same place in relation to our young people that the Review holds with the older ones.

It is becoming more and more evident that the burden of the work in giving the message is to rest on the young people of this denomination.

How necessary, then, that they should have the best of instruction and guidance in their preparation for the work.

The Instructor is designed to fill this place and should be found in the home of every sabbath-keeper.

Eight pages, published weekly.

# The Review and Herald

Not one family of English-speaking Seventh-day Adventists in the world can afford to miss the weekly visit of this our church paper.

How can we keep in touch with the rapid march of the message through every kindred, nation, tongue, and people unless we have the weekly reports from our workers "on the firing-line"?

It means much now to "keep pace with the message." One has to run, at times, so rapid is the development of our work in foreign fields.

The "good old Review" not only keeps us posted on the progress of the work, but it contains in every issue articles wonderfully instructive and helpful in the upbuilding of a perfect Christian character.

Twenty-four pages, weekly.
