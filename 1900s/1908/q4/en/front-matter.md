Does not this picture of Bengali Sabbath-keepers appeal to our Sabbath-school students? There are millions of souls in every land waiting for the truth. Think of themâ€”over 400,000,000 in China; over 300,000,000 in India; over 150,000,000 in Africa; and 150,000,000 more elsewhere in the world. The time to help is in the time of need. Now is the time of need.
