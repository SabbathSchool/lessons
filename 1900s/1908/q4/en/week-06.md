## Notes.

1. Paul as a steward of God was entrusted with the Gospel of the grace of God. This he was to dispense to the people.

2. The Gospel was made known to the apostle Paul by "revelation." We may understand in theory the sublime themes of the Gospel, but when we yield wholly to God His Spirit will reveal to the soul the great and profound truths of His word.

3. Jesus died that the universe of intelligent beings might have a full and true knowledge of God in all the glorious perfection of His character. But it would have been in vain that Christ died on Calvary, so far as the inhabitants of other worlds are concerned, if the story of the Cross should never be published or made known among them. And this is to be "made known by ["through," A.R.V.] the church." The redeemed are to be the mediums through whom the wonderful and manifold wisdom of God is to be made known.

4. "Christ is acquainted with all that is misunderstood and misrepresented by men. His children can afford to wait in calm patience and trust, no matter how much maligned and despised; for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, and those who honor God shall be honored by Him in the presence of men and angels.

"In every age, God's chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted; yet through their very affliction, the knowledge of God has been spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to step into the ranks, and carry forward the same work, knowing that its foes can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. God means that truth shall be brought to the front, and become a subject of examination and discussion, even through the contempt placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach, every effort to restrict liberty of conscience, is God's means of awakening minds that otherwise might slumber." â€”"Mount of Blessing," pages 50, 51.
