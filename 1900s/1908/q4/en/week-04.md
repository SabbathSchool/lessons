## Notes.

1. Christ not only gave Himself for us, but He gave Himself to us. He became one of us. In order for His name to be "Jesus"—Saviour, He must be "Immanuel"—God with us.

2. The minding of the flesh is enmity against God. It is not possible for those in the flesh to please God. Sin is that which separates us from God, whether Jew or Gentile. Jesus abolished sin by becoming sin and dying to sin. By faith we accept His crucifixion for ours, and His life of righteousness for our life of sin.

3. "Into the world where Satan claimed dominion God permitted His Son to come, a helpless babe, subject to the weakness of humanity. He permitted Him to meet life's peril in common with every human soul, to fight the battle as every child of humanity must fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal loss." —"Desire of Ages," page 49.

"Many claim that it was impossible for Christ to be overcome by temptation. Then He could not have been placed in Adam's position; He could not have gained the victory that Adam failed to gain. If we have in any sense a more trying conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor us. But our Saviour took humanity, with all its liabilities. He took the nature of man, with the possibility of yielding to temptation." —Id., page 117.

4. "It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken." —Id., page 25.

5. "Through the eternal ages He [Christ] is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.' He gave Him not only to bear our sins and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature. . . . In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven are bound together." —Id., page 25.
