## Notes.

1. As a convict in a Roman prison, the apostle penned the glorious Gospel message contained in this wonderful epistle. As a prisoner upon the lonely, barren Isle of Patmos, the beloved apostle, wrapped in the vision of God's glory, was permitted to hand down to us the glorious panoramic view contained in the book of Revelation. Thus the efforts of men, inspired by the spirit of the dragon, to hinder the work of the Gospel, have been so overruled that they have turned out gloriously to the furtherance of God's work. Surely, as the apostle states it, "We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."

2. The margin of this verse reads, "or a multitude of captives." In Matt. 27:52, 53 we are told that when Jesus arose from the dead, the "graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after His resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many." In Rev. 4:4, 10, 11; 5:8-10, some of this same company are seen. The "multitude of captives," therefore, are those who were resurrected when Jesus came forth from the grave. They ascended with Him as trophies of His victory.
