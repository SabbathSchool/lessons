## Notes

1. The word here translated "bottomless pit" signifies an abyss. It is a place or condition of darkness and desolation. It means a place of chaos, such as the earth was when darkness was upon the face of the deep, before God created light.

2. The language of this text is very clear and emphatic. "All that do wickedly," God says, shall in that day which is to burn "as an oven" be burned up. Anything can not be said to be burned up so long as it is still burning. God proposes to burn up sin, and in destroying that He must burn up those who cling to sinâ€”those who fail to choose Jesus Christ. It should be observed that this destruction is so complete that Inspiration says there is neither "root [Satan] nor branch [sinners] left of sin. In "Early Writings," page 154 we read: "Satan and his angels suffered long. Satan bore not only the weight and punishment of his own sins, but also of the sins of the redeemed host, which had been placed upon him; and he must also suffer for the ruin of souls he had caused. Then I saw that Satan and all the wicked host were consumed, and the justice of God was satisfied. . . . Said the angel, 'Satan is the root, his children are the branches. They are now consumed root and branch. They have died an everlasting death. They are never to have a resurrection, and God will have a clean universe.'"
