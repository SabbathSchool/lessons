## Notes

1. Inasmuch as the righteous dead are raised and the righteous living translated in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the second coming of Christ, it is evident that the judgment to determine who is worthy of life must precede the second advent.

2. As shown in last quarter's studies, the day of atonement, or cleansing of the sanctuary, in the tabernacle service, was the last of the yearly round of ministration. It was a day of judgment in the camp of Israel, and whatsoever soul did not find pardon in that day was cut off. Lev. 23:27-29. So the antitypical day of atonement, the time of the closing ministry of our High Priest in heaven, is the hour of the investigative judgment. The beginning of this closing work of judgment is at the close of the prophetic period of Dan. 8:14. This period of 2300 prophetic days, or literal years, was to reach from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary. That commandment went forth in the year B.C. 457, and ended in the year 1844. Then began the solemn work of the investigative judgment.
