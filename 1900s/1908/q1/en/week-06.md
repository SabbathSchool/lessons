## Notes

"One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ's second coming to complete the great work of redemption. To God's pilgrim people 'so long left to sojourn in the 'region and shadow of death,' a precious joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who is the Resurrection and the Life, to 'bring home again His banished.' The doctrine of the second advent is the very key-note of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the promised One to break the destroyer's power and bring them again to the lost Paradise. Holy men of old looked forward to the advent of the Messiah in glory as the consummation of their hope. . . .

"The coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of His true followers. The Saviour's parting promise upon Olivet, that He would come again, lighted up the future for His disciples, filling their hearts with joy and hope that sorrow could not quench, nor trials dim. Amid suffering and persecution, 'the appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ' was the 'blessed hope.' . . . On rocky Patmos the beloved disciple hears the promise, 'Surely, I come quickly,' and his longing response voices the prayer of the church in all her pilgrimage, 'Even so, come, Lord Jesus.'"â€”"Great Controversy," pages 299-302.
