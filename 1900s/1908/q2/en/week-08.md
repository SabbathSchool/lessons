## Suggestions for Additional Study

The humility of John the Baptist, as he compared himself with the Messiah, made him a suitable messenger of the kingdom of righteousness.

Note the difference between John's estimate of himself and the estimate which Jesus placed upon him.

The message of John the Baptist was a very definite one, and by his application of the expression "Behold your God," he pointed out Jesus of Nazareth in the place where He then was and indicated the work which He came to do as the sacrifice for sin.

In the Threefold Message of Revelation 14 the expression "Behold your God" in its proper application points out Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary as the High Priest accomplishing His final work of atonement. There is the same need of definiteness now as in John's time.

The voice which was once lifted up "with strength" is heard again in the Threefold Message which is proclaimed "with a loud voice," and with which "another angel" (Rev. 18:1) joins, crying "mightily with a strong voice."

Every genuine movement in the development of the Gospel can be tested by the prophecies. Amos 3:7.

The message of John the Baptist was a rebuke to open sin and to formalism, and pointed all to Jesus as the only way to freedom from sin. Righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ, and not through works, or through fleshly descent, was the meaning of his teaching.

## Notes

"As a prophet, John was 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.' In preparing the way for Christ's first advent, he was a representative of those who are to prepare a people for our Lord's second coming. The world is given to self-indulgence. Errors and fables abound. Satan's snares for destroying souls are multiplied. All who would perfect holiness in the fear of God, must learn the lessons of temperance and self-control. The appetites and passions must be held in subjection to the higher powers of the mind. This self-discipline is essential to that mental strength and spiritual insight which will enable us to understand and to practise the sacred truths of God's word. For this reason temperance finds its place in the work of preparation for Christ's second coming."—"Desire of Ages," Chapter X.

"All who become the subjects of Christ's kingdom, he [John] said, would give evidence of faith and repentance. Kindness, honesty, and fidelity would be seen in their lives. They would minister to the needy and bring their offerings to God. They would shield the defenseless, and give an example of virtue and compassion. So the followers of Christ will give evidence of the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. In the daily life, justice, mercy and the love of God will be seen. Otherwise they are like the chaff, that is given to the fire."—Id.

"John had been deeply moved as he saw Jesus bowed as a suppliant [at the time of His baptism] pleading with tears for the approval of the Father. As the glory of God encircled Him, and the voice from heaven was heard, John recognized the token which God had promised. He knew that it was the world's Redeemer whom he had baptized. The Holy Spirit rested upon him, and with outstretched hand pointing to Jesus, he cried, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.'"—Id.
