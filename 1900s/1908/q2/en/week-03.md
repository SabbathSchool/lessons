## Notes

"After the dispersion from Babel, idolatry again became well-nigh universal, and the Lord finally left the hardened transgressors to follow their evil ways, while He chose Abraham, of the line of Shem, and made him the keeper of His law for future generations. . . .

"The message of God came to Abraham, 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee.' In order that God might qualify him for his great work, as the keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be separated from the associations of his early life. . . .

"Abraham's unquestioning obedience is one of the most striking evidences of faith to be found in all the Bible. To him, faith was 'the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.' Relying upon the divine promise, without the least outward assurance of its fulfillment, he abandoned home and kindred and native land, and went forth, he knew not whither, to follow where God should lead. . . .

"Of Abraham it is written that 'he was called the friend of God,' 'the father of all them that believe.' The testimony of God concerning this faithful patriarch is, 'Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.' And again, 'I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.' It was a high honor to which Abraham was called, that of being the father of the people who for centuries were the guardians and preservers of the truth of God for the world,—of that people through whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed in the advent of the promised Messiah. But He who called the patriarch judged him worthy. It is God that speaks. He who understands the thoughts afar off, and places the right estimate upon men, says, 'I know him.' There would be, on the part of Abraham, no betraying of the truth for selfish purposes. He would keep the law, and deal justly and righteously. And he would not only fear the Lord himself, but would cultivate religion in his home. He would instruct his family in righteousness. The law of God would be the rule in his household. . . .

"'Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.' And Paul says, 'They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.' But Abraham's faith was made manifest by his works. . . . There are many who fail to understand the relation of faith and works. They say, 'Only believe in Christ, and you are safe. You have nothing to do with keeping the law.' But genuine faith will be manifest in obedience. Said Christ to the unbelieving Jews, 'If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.' And concerning the father of the faithful, the Lord declares, 'Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.' Says the apostle James, 'Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.' And John, who dwells so fully upon love, tells us, 'This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 105, 126, 140, 153, and 154.

It is plain that the call of Abraham and his experience constituted a message of righteousness by faith to the world. It was a divine call to reformation of character,—from the self-life to the life of faith revealed in implicit obedience to God. Like Noah, Abraham was a preacher of righteousness by faith. As Noah's righteousness was the kind which manifested itself in following the Lord fully, so Abraham's righteousness was testified to by his obedience. "By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out." Heb. 11:8, A.R.V. These same principles are vital in the threefold message to-day. A people is now being called out from the world to receive the inheritance, and as their title to the heavenly country they must possess a righteousness by faith such as Abraham revealed in his life of obedience to the commandments of God. The Gospel preached by Noah and Abraham was the same as is being proclaimed to the world now, but in each case it is adapted to the demands of the time. In every great Gospel movement, the preachers must learn from God, through His word, how to apply the old-new Gospel to the special needs of the hour.
