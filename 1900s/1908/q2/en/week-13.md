## Notes

In the history of the Gospel there have been seven great reform movements:
1. The Flood and the preaching of Noah.
2. The call of Abraham.
3. The deliverance from Egypt.
4. The restoration from Babylon.
5. The message of John the Baptist.
6. The reformation of the sixteenth century.
7. The great second advent movement.

Each has been a movement to present the Gospel of righteousness by faith in its purity and power.

This series of lessons ought to make it clear that this last Gospel message is in line with the preaching of the Gospel in all the great crises of history in the past, and that it must necessarily be a proclamation of righteousness by faith. In this generation the everlasting Gospel is to be presented according to the outline given in Rev. 14:6-12, and in view of the impending destruction of the world and the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God at the second advent of Christ. This will give a freshness and power to this great doctrine, and enable it to meet the needs of this time in restoring and placing in their proper setting all the truths which have been either perverted or set aside altogether in the great apostasy.
