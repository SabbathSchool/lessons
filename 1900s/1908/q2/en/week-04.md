## Notes

The Threefold Message of Revelation 14 is the final proclamation of the everlasting Gospel of righteousness by faith before the promised inheritance is bestowed. This message calls upon all to forsake all—country, home, and kindred—as Abraham did, in order to be ready to share with Abraham in the possession of the new earth. The faith of Abraham which was counted to him for righteousness, worked in him the keeping of the commandments of God, and the faith which will insure a share in the inheritance will work the same result in this time when the Seed to whom the promise was made is about to come to bestow upon those who are one with Him all that was promised to Him. The "great multitude, which no man could number" (Rev. 7:9), is the seed of Abraham, in fulfillment of Gen. 13:16 and 15:5.
