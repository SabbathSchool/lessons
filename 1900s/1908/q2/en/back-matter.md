# THE GREAT CONTROVERSY
BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN DURING THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION

BY MRS. E. G. WHITE

THIS volume presents the most wonderful and intensely interesting history that has ever been written of the great conflict between Christianity and the powers of darkness, as illustrated in the lives of Christian martyrs and reformers on the one hand, and of wicked men and persecuting powers on the other. Beginning with our Lord's great prophecy given while viewing Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, this book outlines the history of the whole dispensation down to the time when "sin and sinners are no more; God's entire universe is clean; and the great controversy is forever ended." This remarkable book contains over 700 pages, and 26 illustrations. The work is handsomely printed and bound.

# POWER FOR WITNESSING

To say that this book tells this or that would be to accuse it of empty doctrine, lifeless theory. It does not tell; it is and does. It is a witness, and with it is a power. It does not preach doctrine, nor about the Holy Spirit, but it is a living testimony of what the Spirit can do because it has already done it for one man, the writer, and for scores of others. You can not read it without meeting on every page a moving, breathing epistle, warm with an inner fire of life. It is full of experiences—facts—of what the power of God through the Holy Spirit has done for the sinner, the unbeliever, the infidel, the professor, the backslider, the drunkard, the fearful, the discouraged, the trembling soul, and the tried and perplexed ones. If you need help and want power, the Holy Spirit's power, this book can put you in the way of getting it. Not at all stilted, but face to face with you, and no beating about the bush.

Short chapters, 44 of them to 201 pages, large type, heavy paper, beautiful cover design in three colors, size 5½ x 8, cloth binding, 75 cents, post-paid.

# The Sanctuary Question

When you have finished reading this tract on The Priesthood you will want to read what is contained in the following pamphlets relative to the work of the priests and sanctuary service anciently; and the work of our Great High Priest.

## CHRIST OUR ADVOCATE
His Ministry in the True Tabernacle

This pamphlet, by M. H. Brown, treats the Sanctuary Question in a very clear and comprehensive way. It tells all about the sanctuary service as conducted anciently, the priesthood, high priest, the various offerings and their significance, the meaning of the cleansing of the sanctuary, and gives an interpretation of the 2,300 days. It shows how all the earthly service was a type of the work now going on in heaven by our Great High Priest, where He is interceding in our behalf. Besides the numerous illustrations, there are several very valuable diagrams, explaining periods of time given in connection with the sanctuary question. 112 pages. Price, 10 cents.

## LOOKING UNTO JESUS
Or Christ in Type and Antitype

Another work of high merit is the one with the above title, by the late Uriah Smith. He goes deeply into the sanctuary question, showing clearly what the great sacrificial system symbolized, and explaining in detail the priesthood, service and offerings. Some of the points particularly interesting, as used in connection, are the atonement, the incarnation, the cleansing of the sanctuary, work of judgment, finishing the mystery of God, the close of probation, the seven last plagues, and the end of sin. Fully illustrated, and will prove most interesting and highly profitable to the reader. 290 pages. Price, 25 cents.
