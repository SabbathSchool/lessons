14. Why is "much speaking" in prayer unnecessary? 

15. Study the model prayer given by our Lord, asking yourself these questions: a. How many times is the name of God mentioned? In what form? b. How many distinct things are asked for? c. Would the answer to this prayer cover our essential needs each day? d. What is the reason for asking these things of the Father? 

19. How does this instruction compare with that on doing good deeds and on praying?

## Notes

1. The first verse lays down a general principle which is en-larged upon and applied in the following instruction on doing alms, on praying, and on fasting. When such deeds are prompted by wrong motive, they "have no reward" of our heavenly Father.

2. The reading of the Revised Version, "They have received their reward," brings out a little more clearly the meaning of this passage; that is, they have received the reward they seek for — the glory of men —but nothing more.

18. It is not necessary to the meaning. To know that "thy Father... shall reward thee," is enough. We can leave to Him how and when and where to do it.

4. God tempts no man. James I:

13. "Do not suffer us, or permit us, to be tempted to sin," is Barnes's comment on this text. God would empty heaven of every angel, and even come personally to our assistance, before He would permit a trusting child of His to be led unwillingly into sin. Only seek for keeping power, and it is yours.
