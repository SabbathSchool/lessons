## Questions

2. What instruction did the angel of the Lord give to Joseph in a dream? 

3. What did Joseph' promptly do? Why did he de-part by night? 

4. How long did they remain in Egypt? What prophecy refers to this experience? 

5. What course did Herod pursue meanwhile? 

8. What did Joseph again promptly do? 

52. Note The only direction given Joseph by the angel was, "Go into the land of Israel." That he desired to return to Judea and dwell at Bethlehem seems evident from the record that he was afraid to go there when he heard that Herod's son was ruling, and "turned aside" into Galilee. Here again prophecy was to be fulfilled.
