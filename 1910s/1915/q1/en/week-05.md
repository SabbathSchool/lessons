## Notes

1. He was hungry, and needed nourishment.

2. He was able to turn the stones into bread.

3. His sonship was challenged. "Satan was seeking a dispute with Jesus concerning His being the Son of God. He referred to His weak, suffering con-dition, and boastingly affirmed that he was stronger than Jesus. But the word spoken from heaven, 'Thou art My beloved Son; in Thee I am well pleased,' was sufficient to sustain Jesus through all His sufferings. I saw that Christ had nothing to do in con-vincing Satan of His power, or of His being the Saviour of the world. Satan had sufficient evidence of His exalted station and authority. His unwillingness to yield to Christ's authority had shut him out of heaven."â€”"Early Writings.".

3. Satan had usurped the dominion of the earth and man, which Christ came to redeem. Jesus is here tempted to receive this dominion back without enduring the cross.

4. Jesus asserted His divine authority in the command, "Get thee hence," and Satan quailed before it.
