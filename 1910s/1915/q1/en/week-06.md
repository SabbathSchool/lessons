2. "His word was with power." Nothing will give greater power to the teaching or preaching of the Word, than ex-periencing the power of that Word for deliverance in personal conflicts under temptation.

5. Here the two brothers not only left their ship and nets, and left them immediately, but they also left "their father"— a still greater test for every missionary who goes out into the service of Christ.
