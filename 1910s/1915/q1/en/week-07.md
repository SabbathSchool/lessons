## Notes

3. "The meek." Those who are patient and gentle under trial or under wrong. They show no spirit of retaliation, no resent-ment, no bigotry, no hardness. Self and self-consciousness are subdued. The spirit is not contentious, or quarrelsome, or irri-table. Self-possession, calmness, and peaceÂ° mark all they say and do.

5. "The peacemakers." Where contention and strife and irrita-bility make life miserable, the one who possesses the gift of composing differences, who has the happy faculty of "pouring oil on the troubled waters," has indeed a blessed ministry. The world is so full of unrest and conflict that peacemakers are needed everywhere, in the home, in the church, in the community.

6. No joy is so great as that of victory under trial, no peace so blissful as that which follows the storm. The degree of joy is proportionate to the intensity of the struggle passed through.
