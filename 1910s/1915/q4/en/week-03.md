## Notes

2. "The selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. In-stead of strengthening their faith by prayer and meditation on the words of Christ, they had been dwelling on their dis-couragements and personal grievances. In this state of dark-ness they had undertaken the conflict with Satan."—"Desire of Ages," page

4. "While the people of a country are taxed for the main-tenance of their king, the monarch's own children are exempt. So Israel, the professed people of God, were required to main-tain His service; but Jesus, the Son of God, was under no such obligation. If priests and Levites were exempt because of their connection with the temple, how much more He to whom the temple was His Father's house."— Id., page
