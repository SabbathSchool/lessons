## Notes

2. This third act of the husbandmen in refusing to render to their lord his own, brings out the terrible results of start-ing upon a course of evil. Probably when they maltreated the first servants, they did not purpose to go so far in wickedness. Their greed extended to seizing only upon the crop of the season. This greed indulged, the way soon opened for greater evil â€” they would seize upon the vineyard itself and make it their own possession. Crime against the servants hardened them for the greater crime of killing the son. So sin of any kind grows rapidly when allowed to come into the life in any degree.

3. The Lord will not be disappointed of fruits. If His offers of grace are rejected by one, they will be made to another. The vineyard misused by the first husbandmen passed into the hands of others, who will deal justly with their lord. The stone rejected by the builders, ultimately be-comes the chief corner stone.

4. Symbols in the parable: a. The householder represents God. b. The vineyard represents the Jewish nation. c. The hedge represents the divine law. d. The tower represents the temple.
