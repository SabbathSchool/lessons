## Notes

2. The Roman denarius, here translated "penny," was equivalent to about seventeen cents. In the parable this defi-nite wage was agreed upon as satisfactory to both the house-holder and the laborers first hired. The other laborers, hired at various times through the day, were promised "whatsoever is right." At settlement, these laborers received a "penny" as their pay, and were satisfied that the promise of their em-ployer had been fully kept.

3. It is necessary, to the purpose of the parable, that settle-ment for the day's labor should begin with the last employed. If the laborers had received their pay in the order in which they were hired, the first might have received their penny and gone on their way satisfied. But settling with the last first, gave opportunity for envy to display itself, and for the lesson to be taught that in the kingdom of heaven reward is not earned, but bestowed out of grace and love in the Giver.
