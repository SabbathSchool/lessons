## Notes

25. In seek-ing to keep the commandments in their spiritual fullness, the young man would have found Christ.

3. According to the young man's testimony, he had observed the commandment not to covet anything that was his neigh-bor's, and so had caught the negative view of this command-ment. But the idea that he should take his Own goods and give them to the poor, was too severe a test for him, even though Jesus had promised him "treasure in heaven" in re-turn. There was an idol in his heart which stood in the way of complete keeping of the commandments. Our idol may not be riches, but still constitute some "other god before Me."

4. The expression "shall hardly enter" is a little ambiguous as it stands, as it may mean, according to common usage, almost but not quite enter. The word "hardly," however, means here with difficulty. As brought out in the next verse, this difficulty is so great that man cannot overcome it in his own strength; but by connecting himself with God, victory is assured.
