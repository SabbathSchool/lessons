## Notes

1. The name "Bethphage" means, house of figs. It was a village near Bethany, on or near the road from Jericho to Jerusalem. Mark mentions both villages. Bethphage prob-ably stood between Bethany and Jerusalem, near the descent from the Mount of Olives, and not far from the old road that crosses the mountain at the summit.

3. The very question, "Who is this?" reveals an ignorance of Jesus that is widespread to-day. When Saul, on the way to Damascus, fell terror-stricken to the earth, and heard the voice of Jesus, he cried out, "Who art Thou, Lord?" The answer came clear and definite, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." It was enough. Saul's next trembling ques-tion was, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" So here the multitude answered, "This is Jesus." It is our privilege to be part of a multitude to tell the world, by our lives and by our words: "This is Jesus. Hear ye Him."

4. "Christ was following the Jewish custom for a royal entry. The animal on which He rode was that ridden by the kings of Israel, and prophecy had foretold that thus the Messiah should come to His kingdom. No sooner was He seated upon the colt than a loud shout of triumph rent the air. The multitude hailed Him as Messiah, their King. Jesus now accepted the homage which He had never before permitted, and the disciples received this as proof that their glad hopes were to be realized by seeing Him established on the throne. The multitude were convinced that the hour of their emancipation was at hand. In imagination they saw the Roman armies driven from Jerusalem, and Israel once more an independent nation. All were happy and excited; the people vied with one another in paying Him homage. They could not display outward pomp and splendor, but they gave Him the worship of happy hearts. They were unable to present Him with costly gifts, but they spread their outer garments as a carpet in His path, and they also strewed the leafy branches of the olive and palm in the way. They could lead the triumphal procession with no royal standards, but they cut down the spreading palm boughs, Nature's emblem of victory, and waved them aloft with loud acclamations and hosannas."â€”"Desire of Ages," page
