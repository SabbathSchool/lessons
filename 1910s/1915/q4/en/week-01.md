## Notes

33. Now He would test their faith in Him without any special manifestation of His power. Peter, who was fore-most in the experience on the sea, now reaffirmed his faith in still stronger terms than before. -

3. " 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of Christ. All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words have power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the conditions upon which men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach God's word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results."â€”"Desire of Ages," page

6. This prophecy refers to the transfiguration, and its ful-fillment will be considered in the next lesson.
