## Notes

1. In God's service, the desire to be first is a disqualifica-tion for serving in the first place. The desire to be above one's fellows is unchristian, and therefore unfits a man to serve acceptably in a position of high responsibility or in-fluence. It leads to putting self first in everything. It is contrary to the spirit of Christ, who "humbled Himself." If this desire to exalt self is put away, service for Christ in any capacity will be found the most exalted of callings.

2. The word "offend" used here and elsewhere means cause to stumble, and is so rendered in the Revised Version. It means literally the placing of an impediment or trap before the feet so as to cause one to stumble and fall. Thus to treat • a trustful or believing one is regarded by our Saviour as a grievous sin.

5. Observe that we have a duty toward the brother who has transgressed against us. Even if we are conscious of having done no wrong toward him, it is our privilege and our duty to go to him in the love of Christ and seek to win him from his evil way. In this we have the example of Jesus, who came to earth to seek and to save the lost sinner.

6. " 'Henceforth,' said Jesus, 'let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.' But he is not to be regarded as cut off from the mercy of God. Let him not be despised or neglected by his former brethren, but be treated with tenderness and compassion as one of the lost sheep that Christ is still seeking to bring to His fold."— Id., page
