## Notes

1. If Jesus' answer to Peter had been meant to be mathe-matically exact, it would probably cover every case, for it is not likely that one brother would have to be forgiven more than four hundred and ninety times. But forgiveness, like other Christian virtues, has"no limits. Jesus doubtless meant His answer to be interpreted, "As many times as he sinneth against thee."
