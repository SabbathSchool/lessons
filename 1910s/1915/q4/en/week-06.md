## Notes

1. In referring the Pharisees to the inspired record, Jesus set us an example of how to answer the questions of un-believers, or of any who may be seeking light sincerely. It is better to let the Bible answer questions as far as possible. It is our part to become familiar enough with its teachings that we may readily quote from it, or refer to it on any oc-casion.

3. There are striking points of likeness between the mar-riage relation and the believer's relation with Christ:

1. It is voluntary; "whosoever will," let him come.

2. It is for life; "no man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."

3. It is a holy alliance; nothing but sin can break the tie.

4. It is a renouncing of all others; "Christ, only Christ."
