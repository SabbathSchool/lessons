## Notes

1. The transfiguration of Christ took place while He was praying. "As He prayed, the fashion of His countenance was altered." It is by prayer that power comes.

3. In this proposal, Peter made the mistake of planning to settle down in a place of much light and of congenial as-sociation, while others all through the land were perishing for want of the light and truth which Peter could give them. Peter and his companions were needed among the people, as was also Jesus their Master. The multitude was already gathering at the foot of the mountain. But the proposal was more serious than this, for Peter thought Jesus was then to be established in His kingdom, with Moses and Elijah as protectors.

4. One purpose of the transfiguration was to help these three more intimate of the Lord's disciples, and through their testimony, the church in every succeeding age, to understand that though Jesus must suffer and die, yet His kingdom of glory was assured. • "The revelation made to the disciples was to be pondered in their own hearts, not to be published abroad. To relate it to the multitudes would excite only ridicule or idle wonder. And even the nine apostles would not understand the scene until after Christ had risen from the dead."—"Desire of Ages," page
