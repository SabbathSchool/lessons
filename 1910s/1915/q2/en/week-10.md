## Notes

2. The expression "At that time" seems to connect this pas-sage with the upbraiding of the cities. If this is so, its application. is probably to the prosperous merchants of these cities, with their worldly wisdom, in contrast with the poor fisher folk who had received Christ as the revelation of the Father, and become the "light of the world." Luke, 'however, with his stronger intro-duction, "In that hour," connects the passage with the return of the seventy. These had brought a very encouraging report, telling "with joy" how the devils had been subject to them through the name of Jesus. Then Jesus had exhorted them to rejoice rather that their names were written in heaven. Fol-lowing this comes His praise to the Father for reVealing these things to those who were poor in this world but rich in simple faith and trust in God.
