## Notes

2. How often has this cry for help in distress been echoed SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY by the follower of Jesus since tha, t stormy night on the sea! One of His followers was passing the night in San Francisco at the time of the great earthquake there. On being waked from a sound sleep by dhe falling of plaster and debris upon his bed, and seeing the strong brick walls swaying to and fro, he cried out, "Lord, save me; I perish." And in the din of that hour, as in the tempest on the sea, the Lord hearkened. In tLe hour of temptation also, when the powers of darkness press sorely upon him, the follower of Jesus cries for deliverance, and the Master hears.

3. The demoniacs recognized what even the "children of the kingdom" failed to discern, that Jesus was the Son of God — the first time He had been so called since His baptism, as far as Matthew's record is concerned.

4. "He allowed the evil spirits to destroy the herd of swine as a rebuke to those Jews who were. raising these unclean beasts for the sake of gain. 'Had not Christ restrained the de-mons, they would have plunged into the sea not only the swine, but also their keepers and owners. The-preservation of both the keepers and the owners was due alone to His power, merci-fully exercised for their deliverance. Furthermore, this event was permitted to take place that the disciples might witness the cruel power of Satan upon both man and beak. The Saviour desired His followers to have a knowledge of the foe whom they were to meet, that they might not be deceived and overcome by his devices. It was also His will that the people of that region should behold His power to break the bondage of Satan and release his captives. And though Jesus Himself departed, the men so marvelously delivered, remained to declare the mercy of their Benefactor."—"Great Controversy," page

17. Notes t. "Be of good cheer." These words imply that the palsied man was in distress of mind. The cause of this distress is, seen in the words which follow: "Thy sins be forgiven thee." This man was under conviction of sin. While he wanted to be healed of palsy, he feared that his sins would bar him from such a blessing. The reason for bidding him be of good cheer was to assure him that his sins were forgiven: It was the natural step, too, toward healing him of physical disease brought on by sins. Sorrow for sin draws forgiveness and restoring power from Jesus.

21. The evil in this charge was that it virtually denied that Jesus was divine.

3. The Pharisees might as well have asked, Who can heal but God alone? They could actually see that the effects of sin in this man's body were removed instantly by the power of Jesus' word. Has not He who can remove the results of sin the power to forgive the sin itself? If He can forgive sin, is He not God? So were the Pharisees answered; and so ought they to have been convinced on their own ground, that no one but God can forgive sin.

4. This is the Matthew who was numbered among the twelve, and who became the author of the Gospel we are studying. ' Marvelous power in Jesus' bidding, "Follow Me"! The soil in Matthew's heart had been prepared by the previous' teaching of Jesus, as was that of thousands who responded to the preach-.. ing of Pentecost. "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand."

5. The fact that John's disciples included the Pharisees with themselves in asking the question about fasting, indicates that the Pharisees had been seeking to create doubt and. disaffettion among John's disciples as well as those of Jesus. Thus do blind leaders, by secret and indirect means, seek to draw away dis-ciples after themselves.
