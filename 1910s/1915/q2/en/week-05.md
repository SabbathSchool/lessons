## Notes

1. The tender and fatherly way in which Jesus addressed those who were in distress, is particularly noticeable. As He had called the palsied man "son," so. He called this suffering woman "daughter." How. closely He identified Himself with needy humanity, frequently calling Himself "Son of man"!

3. There would seem 'to have been no time in the history of the world when laborers were fewer in comparison with the greatness of the harvest, than is the case to-day. With a deep sense of its necessity, we can pray the prayer commended by our Lord to His-disciples.
