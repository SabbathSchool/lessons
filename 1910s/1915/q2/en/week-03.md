## Notes

2. In touching the leper, Jesus disregarded the common sen-timent toward a leper, "Touch not the unclean thing." The same power that creates living tissue, can also restore diseased or dead tissue. So may the leprosy of sin be healed by the divine touch of grace.

3. The leprosy was cleansed immediately because the words, "Be thou clean," carried in them the active power of cleansing.

5. The noble character of the centurion is indicated by his deep concern for a servant, by his sense of his own unworthiness, and by his unbounded confidence in Jesus' word.

6. Observe that the centurion said he was "under" authority as well as in authority. He knew both how to obey and how to command. So he knew the palsy would obey the command of the Master.

7. Verse II suggests the world-wide scope of the. message for â€¢our times, and ought greatly to encourage us to expect fruit of our labors.
