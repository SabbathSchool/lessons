## Notes

2. Jesus says that the faithful worker will be called before civil authorities "for My sake," or more exactly, "because of Me." The teaching and, preaching of Jesus stirs up the wolfish nature in unrepentant or bigoted hearts. The purpose in allowing His servants to be-persecuted is here made clear: "for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles." The gospel must reach men in authority, and often the only way to get their ear is through civil process. The worker, then, is to recognize such an occasion as his opportunity to bear vC, tness for Jesus.

4. Fleeing, though apparently an act of cowardice, is often the better part of wisdom. There is such a thing as a masterly retreat in time of battle, to save the lives of men, and conserve fighting strength. In gospel work, the seeds of truth must be scattered. Persecution scattered the early Christians away from Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and they "went every-where preaching the Word." The worker is not to "tarry at all hazards," but to go where he can do the most good.

5. What the disciples had learned from Jesus in quiet retreats, in the still hours of the night, thcy were to teach openly and boldly, keeping back ne-ing; and thi, in the face of the hard-ships they should endure.

6. "I will not fear what man shall do unto me," but I may well fear the tempter and destroyer of souls, and find refuge in the tender care and protection of the Father.
