## Notes

3. Jesus never held out the idea that there is no cross-bearing in His service. The cross comes before the crown. He who accepts Jesus as his Saviour, not only obtains "remission of sins that are past," but he enters upon a new experience, the work of being transformed by His grace in meeting and overcoming in the daily conflicts of life. The follower of Jesus must follow Him in bearing the cross day by day, as well as in participating in "the glory that should follow."

4. In the service of Christ, nothing is too small to be taken into account for reward, so long as it is done "in His name" and for His sake. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these,... ye have done it unto Me." So the giving of even a cup of water "in the name of a disciple" of Jesus, islireckoned as done in the name of Jesus. '
