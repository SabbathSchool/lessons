## Notes

2. As Jesus had come to earth to seek and to save the lost of His Father's universal house, so the apostles were first to go to seek and to save the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Jews themselves won to Christ, their first mission was to their Jewish brethren.

4. "Freely." The meaning of this word is not liberally, in large measure, without restraint, as we generally Use it now. It is rather free, without pay, without desert. The free gift of grace, of righteousness, of life, is not merited in any sense by the recipient. What Christ brought to the world and had bestowed upon the disciples was given freely â€” without price, and without merit. So were they in turn to pass it on to others. So it was said prophetically of Christ, "They have hated Me freely," that is, without a cause, without His deserving it. So also, "Whosoever will, let him take the water.. of life freely."

5. In this first missionary effort, Jesus established the gospel principle that "the laborer is worthy of his hire." The apostles had great gifts to bestow, and these were to be given not as a "reward, of merit," but as an outright gift. In comparison with this, the supplying of their temporal needs by those who received the gospel, was but a trifle; and the laborer was worthy of it.
