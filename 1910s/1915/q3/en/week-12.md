## Notes

2. The sign that the Jews most needed had already been given them â€” the sign of the prophet Jonah, with the lesson of Jonah's message of repentance to Nineveh. This was also the message of John the Baptist. If the Pharisees and the Sadducees could have the experience of "repentance, this would clear up their spiritual perceptions; but without repentance and belief on the Lord Jesus Christ, it would be useless to give them other signs.
