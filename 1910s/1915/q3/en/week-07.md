5. Why did he not do it? 

15. What did John's disciples then do? 

19. What did He do for them? Same verses.

## Notes

1. Everywhere Jesus went, His teaching and miracles stirred the people, and set them to thinking and talking of what He taught and did. This is the true meaning of fame. How often it is said of Jesus that His fame went throughout the cities, villages, and coasts of Palestine!

2. Herod had not come into personal contact with Jesus, but he had come into contact with His forerunner, John the Bap-tist. The power accompanying the work of Jesus was so simi-lar to that accompanying the work of John, that Herod mis-took Jesus for John. So ought the life of every representative of Jesus to be such that it will reveal the spirit and character of the Master.
