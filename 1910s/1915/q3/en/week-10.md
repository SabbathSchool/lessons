## Notes

3. The Jews had formulated so many regulations of a cere-monial and often trivial nature, whose disregard was said to bring defilement, that there was, much confusion in the people's minds between the commandments of God and the command-ments of men. This is made evident by Peter's request for an explanation of Jesus' statement about what "goeth into" and what "cometh out of" the mouth. Jesus did not leave the dis-ciples in any doubt about His meaning. Neither do His words contradict the plain statement of the Bible with reference to certain things that are "unclean" and thus unfit to eat.
