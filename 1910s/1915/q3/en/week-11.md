## Notes

8. It is pleasing to the Lord and a blessing to us to press our petitions to the throne of mercy, if we as according to His will. Men were annoyed at the woman's importunity, but Jesus pronounced her of great faith and granted her request.

2. Notice how fully the woman identified herself with the in-terests of her daughter. Her cry was, "Have mercy on me," "Help me," when her supplication was for the deliverance of her daughter.

15. By her faith in Jesus' power to heal, and by her perseverance in pray-ing that He exercise it upon her daughter, this woman showed that though a Canaanite by race, she was really a member of the spiritual house of Israel.
