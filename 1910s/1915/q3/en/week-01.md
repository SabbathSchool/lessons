## Notes

1. Although this verse does not specifically mention the cast-ing out of the devil, this was included in the miracle, as shown by the contention taken up by the Pharisees on this occasion. In fact Luke makes the casting out of the devil the principal feature, with the restoration of speech a result. Luke Is:

3. Even Christians are in danger of assuming that there is a middle course of action, some neutral ground to walk upon. They do not want to be reckoned against Christ, are not ready to admit in their own hearts that they are; yet many are not positively enough for Him to leave no man, nor their own con-sciences, without doubt as to where they stand. Christ is satis-fied with nothing less than the whole man —body, soul, and spirit.

4. In commenting on the unpardonable sin, Dean Mansel says: "The sin is not a single act, but a spirit of hostility to Christ manifesting itself in continued acts. If this be the case, there is no reason why any repentant sinner should despair of salva-tion under the fear that he has committed this sin. The fact of his repentance itself shows that his state of mind has not been that of entire enmity, that he has not so grieved the Holy Spirit as to be finally forsaken by Him." The unpardonable sin is the sin that refuses pardon. "There are none so hardened as those who have slighted the invitation of mercy, and done despite to the Spirit of grace. The most common manifestation of the sin against the Holy Spirit, is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation to repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step toward the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy Spirit. In re-jecting Christ the Jewish people committed the unpardonable sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy, we may commit the same error."—"Desire of Ages," page
