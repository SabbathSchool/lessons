## Notes

1. The "tares" here mentioned are a kind of darnel, a poison-ous weed. During growth, it is very similar in appearance to wheat; but when it heads out, the grains are black, and easy to distinguish from wheat.

3. For "declare," the Revised Version has "explain." The meaning of the parable was not clear to the disciples, especially the feature of the tares. As they frequently did, so here they asked Him for an explanation in private.
