2. The common mustard of Palestine grows wild, attaining the height of a horse and rider, as travelers have noticed.

4. The lesson of the mustard seed is here repeated in a dif-ferent form. The farmer may think upon the power of God's word as he sows the little seed, placing it out of sight beneath the soil, to come forth later as a tender plant, which under his care and God's blessing bears a hundredfold. The housekeeper may meditate upon the silent working of the Spirit upon the indifferent heart, as she mixes the leaven in her flour, and waits patiently for the rising of the dough till she can bake her bread and distribute it to the needy.
