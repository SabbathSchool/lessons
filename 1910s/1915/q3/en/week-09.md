## Notes

2. The word translated "spirit" here is not the one generally used in the New Testament in such expressions as "Holy Spirit," or, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of," or, "Her spirit came again." In these expressions, the word pneuma is used; but in this exclamation of fear by the disciples, the word used is phantasma, from which we get "phantom," with about the same meaning as "apparition" or "specter." In our language and time, the natural expression would have been, "It's a ghost." Just what the disciples thought it was, need not trouble us. It is sufficiently clear that they could not explain the phenomenon of a man walking on the sea, and as some of us might have done, called it a ghost. How cheering must the familiar voice of Jesus have seemed to them in their strait!
