## Notes

1. "It was nearly two days before the journey was ended and Cornelius had the glad privilege of opening his doors to a gospel minister, who according to the assurance of God, should teach him and his house how they might be saved. While the messengers were upon their errand, the centurion had gathered together as many of his relatives as were accessible, that they, as well as he, might be instructed in the truth. When Peter arrived, a large company were gathered, eagerly waiting to listen to his words." — "Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 329.

2. "As Peter entered the house of the Gentile, Cornelius did not salute him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of Heaven, and sent to him by God. It is an Eastern custom to bow before a prince or other high dignitary, and for children to bow before their parents who are honored with positions of trust. But Cornelius, overwhelmed with reverence for the apostle who had been delegated by God, fell at his feet and worshiped him. Peter shrank with horror from this act of the centurion, and lifted him to his feet, saying, 'Stand up; I myself also am a man.' He then commenced to converse with him familiarly, in order to remove the sense of awe and extreme reverence with which the centurion regarded him." — "Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 329, 330.

3. "This chapter [Acts 10] has much precious counsel in it for us, and we should study it with humble attention. When the Lord has His appointed agencies whereby He gives help to souls, and men disrespect these agencies, and refuse to receive help from them, and decide that they will be directly taught of God, the Lord does not gratify their desire. The man who takes such a position is in danger of taking up with the voices of strangers, and of being led into false paths. Both Cornelius and Peter were instructed what they were to do, and they obeyed the angel's word. Cornelius gathered his household together to hear the message of light from Peter. If he had said, I will not be taught of any man, the angel would have left him to himself." — Mrs. E. G. White, in "Review and Herald," No. 40, 1893.

4. The disciples of Christ must not be respecters of persons. Neither nationality, nor social rank, nor poverty, nor riches must influence our interest in the salvation of souls. "If ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin." James 2:9.
