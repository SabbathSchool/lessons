## Notes

1. "Herod the king." Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great, now ruled all Palestine under the Romans. Herod the Great died soon after the birth of Jesus. Herod Antipas, the son to whom Galilee and Perea were given, was the Herod who put John the Baptist to death.

2. "Four quaternions of soldiers" Four sets of men, one for each watch, and four men in each set, two of whom were chained to Peter in the cell, and two were on guard outside.

The Greek word "Passover" is wrongly rendered Easter in the King James Version. The word "Easter" is of Saxon origin. "Herod purposed putting Peter to death, but as a strict Jew he would not pollute the festival by shedding blood, and therefore had Peter imprisoned till after the Passover. There were four modes of execution lawful among the Jews, stoning, decapitation, burning, and strangling." — Tarbell.

3. The Lord does not do for us what we can do for ourselves. The angel freed Peter from the chains which bound him to the soldiers, but he did not put the garments on him. Peter was commanded to gird himself, bind on his own sandals, and cast his garment about him. When they came to the great iron gate that Peter was powerless to open, the gate opened by divine power. The angel stayed with Peter until they had gone through "one street" and were a safe distance from the prison guards, and when the danger was passed left Peter to go the rest of the way himself. God expects us to use the power we have; and when we have reached the limit of our strength He will supply divine strength.

Van Lennep, in "Bible Lands," thus describes an Oriental city gate to which the prison gate may have been similar: "The gates are large, massive, and two-leaved, built of heavy timber, plated with iron. A strong iron bar, hooked at one end, hangs from a heavy ring of the same metal, made fast in a strong post, built into the wall behind each fold of the gate. When the gate is closed, the hooks are set into other iron rings, on the back of its folds, enabling the gate to resist a very heavy pressure from without. The lock is massive and of wrought iron, and the long-handled, ponderous key is carried by the keeper of the gate in his belt, or hung from a nail in his little room close by."

God has opened many doors as firmly fastened as the iron gate which was opened before Peter. It used to be said that the zenanas — the women's quarters — in India could never be entered. "God swung the doors ajar in answer to fervent and faithful prayer and effort." Africa, the "Dark Continent," is now called "the Continent of Opportunity." We are not crying now so much for open doors, as for open hearts to take advantage of opened doors which none can shut.

4. "Herod knew that he deserved none of this praise and homage; yet he did not rebuke the idolatry of the people, but accepted it as his due. The glow of gratified pride was on his countenance as he heard the shout ascend: It is the voice of a god, and not of man! The same voices which now glorified a vile sinner, had, but a few years before, raised the frenzied cry of, Away with Jesus! Crucify Him, crucify Him! Herod received this flattery and homage with great pleasure, and his heart bounded with triumph; but suddenly a swift and terrible change came over him. His countenance became pallid as death, and distorted with agony; great drops of sweat started from his pores. He stood a moment as if transfixed with pain and terror, then, turning his blanched and livid face to his horror-stricken friends he cried in hollow, despairing tones, He whom you have exalted as a god is struck with death!

"He was borne in a state of the most excruciating anguish from the scene of wicked revelry, the mirth, and pomp, and display of which he now loathed in his soul. A moment before, he had been the proud recipient of the praise and worship of that vast throng — now he felt himself in the hands of a Ruler mightier than himself. Remorse seized him; he remembered his cruel command to slay the innocent James; he remembered his relentless persecution of the followers of Christ, and his design to put to death the apostle Peter, whom God had delivered out of his hand; he remembered how, in his mortification and disappointed rage, he had wreaked his unreasoning revenge upon the keepers of the prisoner, and executed them without mercy. He felt that God, who had rescued the apostle from death, was now dealing with him, the relentless persecutor. He found no relief from pain of body or anguish of mind, and he expected none. Herod was acquainted with the law of God, which says, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before Me,' and he knew that in accepting the worship of the people he had filled up the measure of his iniquity, and had brought upon him the just wrath of God.

"The same angel who had left the royal courts of heaven to rescue Peter from the power of his persecutor, had been the messenger of wrath and judgment to Herod. The angel smote Peter to arouse him from slumber; but it was with a different stroke that he smote the wicked king, bringing mortal disease upon him. God poured contempt upon Herod's pride, and his person, which he had exhibited decked in shining apparel before the admiring gaze of the people, was eaten by worms, and putrified while yet alive. Herod died in great agony of mind and body, under the retributive justice of God.

"This demonstration of divine judgment had a mighty influence upon the people. While the apostle of Christ had been miraculously delivered from prison and death, his persecutor had been stricken down by the curse of God. The news was borne to all lands, and was the means of bringing many to believe on Christ." — "Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 343-345.
