## Notes

1. "When he [Paul] had finished, and the Jews had left the synagogue, the Gentiles still lingered, and entreated that the same words might be spoken unto them the next Sabbath day... When the Jewish priests and rulers saw the multitudes that had assembled to hear the new doctrine, they were moved by envy and jealousy, and contradicted the words of the apostles with blasphemy. Their old bigotry and prejudice were also aroused, when they perceived great numbers of Gentiles mingling with the Jews in the congregation. They could not endure that the Gentiles should enjoy religious privileges on an equality with themselves, but clung tenaciously to the idea that the blessing of God was reserved exclusively for them. This had ever been the great sin of the Jews, which Christ, on several occasions, had rebuked... The Gentiles, on the other hand, rejoiced exceedingly that Christ recognized them as the children of God, and with grateful hearts they listened to the word preached. The apostles now clearly discerned their duty, and the work which God would have them do. They turned without hesitation to the Gentiles, preaching Christ to them, and leaving the Jews to their bigotry, blindness of mind, and hardness of heart. The mind of Paul had been well prepared to make this decision, by the circumstances attending his conversion, his vision in the temple at Jerusalem, his appointment by God to preach to the Gentiles, and the success which had already crowned his efforts among them... This gathering in of the Gentiles to the church of God had been traced by the pen of inspiration, but had been but faintly understood. Hosea had said; 'Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which can not be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.' And again, 'I will sow her unto Me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not My people, Thou art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.'" — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," pages 48-51.

2. It is worthy of notice that the Sabbath is mentioned four times in this chapter. There can be no question but that the meeting described in this lesson was held on the seventh day, as that was the day upon which the Jews met for religious worship. Luke, writing by inspiration for Christians in this dispensation, calls it the Sabbath. It must therefore be the Sabbath still. No Bible writer of the New Testament calls it the Jewish Sabbath, or calls any other day the Sabbath or the Lord's day. Paul calls the day on which the Jews met in the synagogue the Sabbath (verse 27), and the Gentiles also called the same day of the week the Sabbath (verse 42). James called it the Sabbath. See Acts 15:21. The evidence is conclusive that the seventh-day Sabbath of the Old Testament is as well the Sabbath of the New Testament.

3. "As many as were ordained to eternal life." Compare verse 46 and John 1:11, 12. "The best rendering would be 'were disposed to eternal life,' which preserves the exact shade of the verb." — Bartlett.
