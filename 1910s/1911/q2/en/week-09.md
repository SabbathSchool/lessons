## Notes

1. "Antioch, the capital of Syria, was very favorably situated for the new outward movement of Christianity. Moreover, Barnabas was a native of Cyprus, the nearest island, and Saul was a native of Cilicia, the neighboring province. Seleucia was about sixteen miles down the river Orontes. Cyprus, about eighty miles southwest of Seleucia, was a triangular island about one hundred fifty miles long and fifty or sixty miles wide. Salamis was the chief city on the eastern coast, and Paphos the capital city, situated on the western coast." — Sunday School Times.

2. "We have, in the history of these two apostles, only a simple record of the laying on of hands, and its bearing upon their work. Both Paul and Barnabas had already received their commission from God Himself; and the ceremony of the laying on of hands added no new grace or virtual qualification. It was merely setting the seal of the church upon the work of God — an acknowledged form of designation to an appointed office." — "Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 349.

3. "Bar-Jesus," — that is, "Son of Joshua." "Elymas [verse 8] is from the Arabic, meaning sorcerer or magician; hence the probability that he was an Arabian Jew." — Riddle.

4. The leading explanation of the change from "Saul" to "Paul," is that he always had both names, as such a custom was common especially among Hellenistic Jews, and that his Gentile (or Roman) name is used from this point, because his mission to the Gentiles becomes prominent.
