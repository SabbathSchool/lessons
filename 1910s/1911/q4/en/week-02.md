## Notes

1. "On the day following Paul's arrival, the elders of the church, with James at their head, assembled to receive him and his fellow travelers as messengers from the Gentile churches. Paul's first act was to present the contributions with which he had been entrusted. He had been careful to guard against the least occasion for suspicion in the administration of his trust by causing delegates to be elected by the several churches to accompany him as joint trustees of the funds collected. These brethren were now called forward, and one by one they laid at the feet of James the offering which the Gentile churches had freely given, although often from their deepest poverty." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 208, 209.

2. The elders warned Paul that there were some in the church who were still striving to maintain the old ceremonies and customs which had passed away. "The elders of the church had been at fault in allowing themselves to be influenced by the enemies of the apostle. But when they heard from his own lips an account of the work he had been doing, it assumed a different aspect. They could not condemn his manner of labor: they were convinced that it bore the signet of heaven. The liberal contributions from the new churches he had raised up testified to the power of the truth. They saw that they had been held in bondage by the Jewish customs and traditions, and that the work of the gospel had been greatly hindered by their efforts to maintain the middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile." — Id., page 211.

3. "But while James assured Paul that the decision of the former council (Acts 15) concerning the Gentile converts and the ceremonial law still held good, the advice given was not consistent with that decision, which had also been sanctioned by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God did not prompt this advice. It was the fruit of cowardice."

   "His advisers were not infallible. Though some of these men wrote under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, yet when not under its direct influence they sometimes erred. It will be remembered that on one occasion Paul withstood Peter to the face because he was acting a double part." — Id., pages 212, 214.

4. "It was customary among the Jews, for those who had received deliverance from any great peril or who from other causes desired publicly to testify their dedication to God, to take upon themselves the vow of a Nazarite, the regulations of which are prescribed in the sixth chapter of the book of Numbers. In that book no rule is laid down as to the time during which this life of ascetic rigor was to continue, but we learn from the Talmud and Josephus that thirty days was at least a customary period. During this time the Nazarite was bound to abstain from wine and to suffer his hair to grow uncut. At the termination of the period he was bound to present himself in the temple with certain offerings, and his hair was then cut off and burnt upon the altar. The offerings required were beyond the means of the very poor, and consequently it was thought an act of piety for a rich man to pay the necessary expenses and thus enable his poorer countrymen to complete their vow." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 545.

5. "The celebration of the festival had attracted multitudes to the holy city, and the temple was thronged with worshipers from every land; and amongst these were some of those Asiatic Jews who had been defeated by his arguments in the synagogue of Ephesus, and irritated against him during the last few years daily more and more by the continual growth of a Christian church in that city, formed in great part of converts from among the Jewish proselytes. These men, whom a zealous feeling of nationality had attracted from their distant home to the metropolis of their faith, now beheld, where they least expected to find him, the apostate Israelite who had opposed their teaching and seduced their converts. An opportunity of revenge which they could not have hoped for in the Gentile city where they dwelt had suddenly presented itself." — Id., page 546.

6. "This cohort of soldiers formed the garrison of Castle Antonia, at the northwest corner of the temple area, so built as to overlook the temple and its courts. The castle was named after Mark Anthony. This fortress communicated with the temple cloisters by means of two flights of steps." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1909, page 288.

7. "The 'Egyptian' whom the chief captain took Paul to be, is mentioned by Josephus. A short time before this he had gathered a large body of discontented Jews on Mount Olivet, whom he had deluded into the belief that he was the Messiah, declaring that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down at his word. Felix marched out against the insurgents and dispersed them, but the Egyptian escaped." — Id., page 289.
