# Sabbath School Lessons on the Book of Acts
For the Fourth Quarter, 1911

## Introductory Note

In this quarter's lessons are narrated the arrest of Paul at Jerusalem, the various scenes of his trial, his appeal to Caesar, and his journey to Rome. Nearly one quarter of the book of Acts is devoted by Luke to these events. Paul's undaunted courage and sacrifice for Christ, and his noble defense made on different occasions before his persecutors, are sublime, and should stir our hearts to renewed zeal and consecration, and deepen our determination to maintain greater faithfulness in the work of God committed to our hands.
