## Notes

1. "Felix, who had never before listened to the truth, was deeply agitated as the Spirit of God sent conviction to his soul. Conscience, now aroused, made her voice heard. He felt that Paul's words were true. Memory went back over the guilty past. With terrible distinctness came up before him the secrets of his early life of lust and bloodshed, and the black record of his later years,— licentious, cruel, rapacious, unjust, steeped with the blood of private murders and public massacres. Never before had the truth been thus brought home to his heart. Never before had his soul been thus filled with terror. The thought that all the secrets of his career of crime were open before the eye of God, and that he must be judged according to his deeds, caused him to tremble with guilty dread." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 143.

2. "No change seems to have taken place in the outward circumstances of the apostle when Festus came to take command of the province. He was still in confinement as before. But immediately on the accession of the new governor the unsleeping hatred of the Jews made a fresh attempt upon his life, and the course of their proceedings presently changed the whole aspect of his case and led to unexpected results." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 578.

3. "Festus was probably surprised by this termination of the proceedings, but no choice was open to him. Paul had urged his prerogative as a Roman citizen to be tried not by the Jewish but by the Roman law — a claim which, indeed, was already admitted by the words of Festus, who only proposed to transfer him to the jurisdiction of the Sanhedrin with his own consent. He ended by availing himself of one of the most important privileges of Roman citizenship, the right of appeal. By the mere pronunciation of those potent words, 'I appeal unto Caesar,' he instantly removed his cause from the jurisdiction of the magistrate before whom he stood, and transferred it to the supreme tribunal of the emperor at Rome." — Id., pages 579, 580.

4. "King Herod Agrippa made a visit of congratulation to Governor Festus. With him came the beautiful and fascinating Bernice, who was both his sister and his illegal wife. She was also sister of Drusilla the wife of Felix, and as dissolute." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1909.
