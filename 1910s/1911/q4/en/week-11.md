### General Note
In this lesson "we are about to trace the apostle's footsteps along that road which was at once the oldest and most frequented in Italy, and which was called, in comparison with all others, the 'queen of roads.' We are no longer following the narrow line of compact pavement across Macedonian plains and mountains or through the varied scenery in the interior of Asia Minor, but we are on the most crowded approach to the metropolis of the world." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 621.

## Notes

1. "In Puteoli, the principal port of southern Italy, where one of the first temples for the worship of Augustus was erected, Paul and his companions were refreshed by the presence of Christian brethren, at whose solicitation they remained a week. Evidently Julius had respect for the wishes of his prisoner, and indeed after the experiences of the past winter he may well have felt that, excepting in the political sense, he was dependent upon Paul rather than Paul upon him. In any case he was willing to grant him special favors, as is proven by the visit in Puteoli." — "Student's Life of Paul," Gilbert, pages 210, 211.

2. "Forty-three miles from Rome was the Market of Appius, and ten miles farther on another station called the Three Taverns. Rome, the capital of the empire, is on the Tiber about fifteen miles from its mouth. At this time its population numbered 1,600,000." — "Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909.

   "The travelers reach Appii Forum, forty miles from Rome. As they make their way through the crowds that throng the great thoroughfare, the gray-haired old man, chained with a group of hardened-looking criminals, receives many a glance of scorn and is made the subject of many a rude, mocking jest. Not one of all he meets bestows upon him a look of pity or sympathy. He meekly wears his chain, and silently, slowly pursues his way.

   "Suddenly a cry of joy is heard, and a man springs out from the passing throng and falls upon the prisoner's neck, embracing him with tears and rejoicing, as a son would welcome a long-absent father. Again and again is the scene repeated. With eyes made keen by loving expectation, many discern in the chained captive the one who spoke to them the words of life at Corinth, at Philippi, or at Ephesus.

   "The whole company is brought to a standstill, as warm-hearted disciples eagerly flock around their father in the gospel. The soldiers are impatient of delay, yet they have not the heart to interrupt this happy meeting; for they too have learned to respect and esteem their prisoner. In that worn, pain-stricken face, the disciples see the image of Christ reflected. They assure Paul that they have not forgotten him or ceased to love him; that they are indebted to him for the joyful hope which animates their lives, and gives them peace toward God. In the ardor of their love they would bear him upon their shoulders the whole way to the city, could they but have the privilege." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 273.

3. "Luke, his fellow traveler, remained with him during his bondage; Timotheus, his beloved son in the faith, ministered to him at Rome, as he had done in Asia, in Macedonia, and Achaia. Tychicus, who had formerly borne him company from Corinth to Ephesus, is now at hand to carry his letters to the shores which they had visited together. But there are two names amongst his Roman companions which excite a peculiar interest, though from opposite reasons — the names of Demas and of Mark. The latter, when last we heard of him, was the unhappy cause of the separation of Barnabas and Paul. He was rejected by Paul as unworthy to attend him, because he had previously abandoned the work of the gospel out of timidity or indolence. It is delightful to find him now ministering obediently to the very apostle who had then repudiated his services; still more, to know that he persevered in this fidelity even to the end, and was sent for by Paul to cheer his dying hours. Demas, on the other hand, is now a faithful 'fellow laborer' of the apostle, but in a few years we shall find that he had 'forsaken' him, 'having loved this present world.' Perhaps we may be allowed to hope that as the fault of Demas was the same with that of Mark, so the repentance of Mark may have been paralleled by that of Demas." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, pages 639, 640.

4. "The Jews who had been banished from Rome some years previous, had been tacitly permitted to return, so that large numbers were now to be found there. To these, first of all, Paul determined to present the facts concerning himself and his work, before his enemies should have opportunity to embitter them against him. Three days after his arrival at Rome, therefore, he called together their leading men, and in a simple, direct manner stated the reasons why he had come to Rome as a prisoner." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 275.

5. "He said nothing of the abuse which he had suffered at the hands of the Jews, or of their repeated plots to assassinate him. His words were marked with caution and kindness. He was not seeking to win personal attention or sympathy, but to defend the truth and to maintain the honor of the gospel." — Id., page 275.

6. "During the long delay of his trial Paul was not reduced, as he had been at Caesarea, to a forced inactivity. On the contrary, he was permitted the freest intercourse with his friends, and was allowed to reside in a house of sufficient size to accommodate the congregation which flocked together to listen to his teaching. The freest scope was given to his labors consistent with the military custody under which he was placed. We are told in language peculiarly emphatic that his preaching was subjected to no restraint whatever. And that which seemed at first to impede must really have deepened the impression of his eloquence, for who could see without emotion that venerable form subjected by iron links to the coarse control of the soldier who stood beside him! How often must the tears of the assembly have been called forth by the upraising of that fettered hand and the clanking of the chain which checked its energetic action!" — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 639.

7. "According to Roman law, the trial of Paul could not take place until his accusers should be present in person to state their charges against him. They had not yet come from Palestine, nor was it known at Rome whether they had even started on the long journey. Therefore the trial might be postponed indefinitely. Little regard was shown for the rights of those supposed to have violated the law. It was often the case that an accused person was kept in prison a long time, by the delay of the prosecutors to prefer their charges; or his trial might be deferred by the caprice of those in power... The Jews of Jerusalem were in no haste to present their accusations against Paul. They had been repeatedly thwarted in their designs, and had no desire to risk another defeat. Lysias, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa had all declared their belief in his innocence. His enemies could hope for success only in seeking by intrigue to influence the emperor in their favor. Delay would further their object, as it would afford them time to perfect and execute their plans." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 380.

8. "The history closes somewhat abruptly. It may have been the intention of the writer to continue his narrative. It is a natural inference that when he closed it the two years had expired, or were on the point of expiring; that he, who had remained with the apostle during his imprisonment, started with him on his eastward journey afterwards; and that some incidents, to us unknown, hindered him from completing the work which he had begun. It is possible, on the other hand, that Theophilus, as an Italian convert, may have known what had passed in Rome during the apostle's first sojourn there, or subsequently, and that St. Luke did not aim at more than setting before his friend the stages by which St. Paul had been brought to the imperial city." — "Handy Commentary" (Acts), Plumptre, page 437.

   From the writings of Mrs. E. G. White we glean the following information concerning Paul's imprisonment until his martyrdom:

   At Paul's examination the charges against him were not sustained, and, contrary to the general expectation, Nero declared the prisoner guiltless. Paul's fetters were struck off and he was free. He left Rome, and again visited the churches; seeking to establish a firmer union between the Greek and Eastern believers. The Jews fastened upon Paul the crime of instigating the burning of Rome, and at the house of a disciple in Troas, he was seized and hurried to Rome and placed in a loathsome dungeon. Paul's last letter, the second epistle to Timothy, was written in this cell. His persecutors fearing the extent of Paul's influence, he was beheaded privately.

   Commentators give the date of his death at about A.D. 66.
