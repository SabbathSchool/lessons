## Notes

1. Just before Moses went up into the mountain near Jordan to view the promised land and die before the Lord, he rehearsed in the ears of all the people the great things God had done for them in Egypt and since their deliverance. He looked forward to the time when they should be settled in their goodly land "flowing with milk and honey," and pointed out their greatest danger. They would be very likely to forget the Lord their God and become lifted up, thinking that it was by their own thrift and industry they had acquired riches in increased flocks and herds and silver and gold. Human hearts are the same in all ages. The people of God in our own time, just before entering the promised Heavenly Canaan, are in danger of failing in this same particular. Thus we should be admonished by this same lesson.

2. Selfishness ever stands with outstretched arms to receive and keep. Love receives only to impart. Cheerfulness in giving is therefore a sure test of pure, unselfish love. It is a test of character, and men and women are saved solely upon the worth of character. The poor widow with the two mites is a type of the cheerful givers whom God especially loves, and who reap special blessings. To such "giving is living, and living is giving." Cheerful giving is the spontaneous outburst of a converted heart that appreciates the value of Heaven's Great Gift to us, and stands forth amid the covetousness and greed of the world as a living example of one truly converted to and blessed of God. To such "it is more blessed to give than to receive."

3. "Not all can make large offerings, not all can do great works, magnificent deeds; but all can practise self-denial, all can reveal the unselfishness of the Saviour. Some can bring large gifts to the Lord's treasury; others can bring only mites; but every gift brought in sincerity is accepted by the Lord." — "Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 54, 55.

4. It is the rust of the money that witnesses against its possessor. This betrays its nature — hoarded treasure. The money thrown to the moles and bats was one time trusted in to purchase every desirable thing. It has no such power in the day when the Lord Jesus is revealed in flaming fire from heaven. These treasures were potent with great blessing had they been used in feeding the poor and sending the gospel to the perishing millions of earth. But it is now too late. The halo and charm have forever departed from these treasures of silver and gold, once so precious in the eyes of those possessing them.

5. We have for our God the Creator of the heavens and the earth. In Him we have all. He who could take five small loaves and two fishes, and by His own blessing upon them feed five thousand people and more — can He not provide for His children anywhere, at any time? Did the vast multitude of Israel lack for food, for water, for clothes, during their sojourn in the wilderness for forty years? Can He not provide for us? To hoard up money and trust in this is a direct insult to God, who delights in continuously working to supply the need of His children. Matt. 16:5-10; Luke 12:6, 7.

6. Here is an instance where a rich man was directly instructed to go and sell all that he had, and was at the same time invited to come and associate with Jesus in His work. There is no question as to this young man's duty on that day. Had he obeyed Jesus implicitly, Christ could have made of him a valued servant. Jesus loved him, but the young man loved his great possessions more than he loved his Lord, and the precious privilege of being personally connected with Him in His ministry of saving souls. Jesus did not direct everybody to sell all they had, and come and follow Him. He even told some to stay at home. But in this young man He saw qualities He could use in His work. The young man turned sorrowfully away. No wonder; for he turned away from his path of duty, away from his God, away from the light, and went, as did Judas, out where it was dark.

7. "My brethren and sisters, do not plead for retrenchment in evangelical work. So long as there are souls to save, our interest in the work of soul-saving is to know no abating. The church can not abridge her task without denying her Master. Not all can go as missionaries to foreign lands, but all can give of their means for the carrying forward of foreign missions." — "Testimonies for the Church, volume 9, pages 55, 56.
