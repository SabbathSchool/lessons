## Notes

1. "After the death of Stephen the disciples were restrained in their active ministry, and many of the believers who had temporarily resided in Jerusalem now retired to their distant homes because of the violent persecution against them. But the apostles dared not leave Jerusalem till the Spirit of God indicated it to be their duty to do so; for Christ had bidden them to first work in that field. Although the priests and rulers bitterly persecuted the new converts, they did not venture for a time to arrest the apostles, being overawed by the dying testimony of Stephen, and realizing that their course with him had injured their own cause in the minds of the people."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 300.

2. "The Romans alone had the power of life and death. The Sanhedrin, by whom Saul was employed (chapter 26:10), could do no more than arrest and imprison, in order to inflict any punishment short of death. It is true, St. Paul himself says that some of them were put to death (chapter 26), but this was either done by Roman authority, or by what is called the judgment of zeal; i.e., when the mob took the execution of the laws into their own hands, and massacred those whom they pretended to be blasphemers of God."—Clarke's Commentary.

3. The means by which the enemies of Christ sought to crush the gospel, were the means of scattering it, and "those holy fugitives were like so many lamps lighted by the fire of the Holy Spirit, spreading everywhere the sacred flame by which they themselves had been illuminated."

4. From now on, in the book of Acts, we see the Lord leading the disciples out toward the peoples and nations round about. They were tempted by their national prejudices and narrow vision to settle down at home and work only for their own people. But, as we learned in the first chapter, the Lord's command was that they should witness "both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."

5. Jesus said, when in Samaria with His disciples, "One soweth and another reapeth." Philip was now reaping the harvest from seed sown in that two days' ministry by the Master.

6. "The apostles sent Peter; he was their messenger, not their master."—Lindsay.

7. John at one time wanted to call down fire on the Samaritans. Now he seeks to bring them the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

8. The crime of Simony is named from Simon. It means the obtaining of preferment or office in the church by the payment of money. It was very common in its worse forms in the Dark Ages. Simon doubtless thought to purchase the gift in order to exercise its powers to gain selfish honor or to make money by it. The gifts of God's Spirit and power are not given to advance any one's selfish desires or commercial interests.
