## Notes

1. No attempt will be made in these lessons to give exact chronological data for the various events. Chronologists are not agreed. The events of this quarter's study begin with the ascension of Christ and extend to the great persecution that followed the death of Stephen. The former event we understand to have occurred in A.D. 31. The "New Standard Dictionary" gives the date of Paul's conversion, which occurred in the time of the persecution referred to, as A.D. 34.

2. "That the author of the book of Acts is the same as that of the third Gospel, is evident from several considerations: from the address to Theophilus, and the reference to a previous treatise similarly addressed; from the strong resemblance in the style of the two books; from the parallelisms particularly noticeable in the description of the shipwreck in Acts and the storm on the Sea of Galilee in the Gospel; from intimations, slight, and yet noticeable, of the author's knowledge of disease and his use of medical terms; and from the fact that Luke, who describes himself as the traveling companion of Paul even to Rome itself, is several times referred to by Paul as being with him in Rome. That the author of both is Luke is the universal testimony of antiquity."—Abbott's Commentary, Acts.

3. The work of Christ in carrying out the plan of salvation may be divided into two parts, His work on earth in person, and His work from heaven through the Holy Spirit. What He "began both to do and teach" while here, He continues to do through His church endowed with the Holy Spirit. Some one speaks of this book as "the second part of the Acts of Jesus." The following references show this to be true: Acts 3:6, 16; 7:59; 9:5, 34; 10:13-15; 12:11; 18:9; 23:11. The book has also been called the "Acts of the Holy Spirit."

4. What precious seasons must have been the interviews of the disciples with their risen Lord during those forty days! Doubtless He explained many things to them which they could only understand in the light of the resurrection, and endeavored especially to make plain the part they were to act in making Him known to the world.

5. They were to be witnesses, not princes, witnessing to the crucifixion (Acts 2:36), resurrection (1:22), and coming (1:11) of Christ. Note the extent of the work—"unto the uttermost part of the earth." At that command, when they understood it, they gave their means, their strength, and their lives to carrying the gospel message into all the known world. To us now comes the same command, to carry the last gospel message to every nation and tongue. And the same power is promised from on high.

6. A Sabbath day's journey was, according to the Talmud, two thousand cubits, or three fourths of a mile.

7. "All who were fully identified as disciples of Christ and associated with the apostles as evangelists, assembled together at Jerusalem. They put away all differences. They continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, that they might receive the fulfillment of the promise of the Holy Spirit; for they were to preach the gospel in the demonstration of the Spirit and in the power of God."—"Gospel Workers," page 370.

8. "This is the very course that should be pursued by those who act a part in the work of proclaiming the coming of the Lord in the clouds of heaven; for a people are to be prepared to stand in the great day of God. Although Christ had given the promise to His disciples that they should receive the Holy Spirit, this did not remove the necessity of prayer. They prayed all the more earnestly; they continued in prayer with one accord. Those who are now engaged in the solemn work of preparing a people for the coming of the Lord, should also continue in prayer."—"Gospel Workers," pages 370, 371.

"Notice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity, when they were no longer striving for the highest place, that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had been put away."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 20.

9. Not only were the believers putting away their sins and praying for the descent of the Spirit, but they were facing the great work for which the Spirit was to be given, and proceeded to transact such business as was necessary for carrying out their mission.
