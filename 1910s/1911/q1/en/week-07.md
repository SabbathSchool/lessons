## Notes

1. The Sadducees seem to have been the leaders in this persecution. According to Josephus, most of the higher class were skeptics or Sadducees, though the mass of the people were Pharisees. The work of the apostles was very offensive to them. It drew away their followers, and refuted their leading doctrine that there was no resurrection. Matt. 22:23.

2. This was indeed a strong protest against the actions of those who taught that there was "neither angel nor spirit." Acts 23:8.

3. "Note the marvelous accuracy of detail in St. Luke's narrative. The Sanhedrin used to sit in the temple, but a few years before the period at which we have arrived, four or five at most, they removed from the temple into the city, a fact which is just hinted at in the sixth verse of the fourth chapter, where we are told that the rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem, that is, in the city, not in the temple; while again in this passage we read that when the high priest came and convened the council and all the senate of the children of Israel, they sent their officers to bring the prisoners before them. These officers after a while returned with the information that the apostles were preaching in the temple. If the Sanhedrin were meeting in the temple, they would doubtless have learned this fact as soon as they assembled, especially as they did not sit till after the morning sacrifice, several hours after the apostles appeared in the temple."—Stokes, Acts.

4. "The apostles and early Christians acted on the principle, that human governments forfeit their claim to obedience when they require what God has plainly forbidden, or forbid what He has required. They claimed the right of judging for themselves what was right and what was wrong, in reference to their religious duties, and they regulated their conduct by that decision. In applying this principle, it will be found that the apostles in every instance abstained from forcible resistance to the public authorities. They refused utterly to obey the mandates which required them to violate their consciences, but they endured quietly the penalties which the executors of the law enforced against them. They evaded the pursuit of their oppressors if they could, secreted themselves from arrest, left their prisons at the command of God, yet when violent hands were laid upon them, and they were dragged before magistrates, to the dungeon, or to death, they resisted not the wrong, but 'followed His steps, who, when He suffered, threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.'"—"Hackett's Commentary," Acts.

5. To have acted upon their passionate desire might have brought them in conflict with the Romans, for the Sanhedrin did not have the power of capital punishment. Doubtless also it would have stirred the great wrath of the people. Whatever Gamaliel's personal opinion may have been, he was used of God to bring victory to His cause. Bernard says: "Gamaliel is described in Acts 5:34 as 'a Pharisee, a doctor of the law, had in honor with all the people.' This description exactly corresponds with that given in the Mishna of Rabban Gamaliel I, who died about A.D. 57, and was at the height of his influence at the time of the trial described in Acts 5. He belonged to the milder and more liberal school of Hillel, whose grandson he is said to have been. He was the teacher of St. Paul."—"Smith's Bible Dictionary," article Gamaliel.

6. We can not think of these Spirit-filled men as "professional" evangelists, yet preaching was decidedly their business. In the temple (in Solomon's porch or portico) they seem to have had daily services; and in the houses, and doubtless on the street, in public and private, they spoke "to the people all the words of this life." The apostle Paul said, "By the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears." Acts 20:31.
