## Notes

1. The day of the week on which that memorable Pentecost fell has been a subject of much interest. Though the question has absolutely nothing to do with determining what day is the Christian Sabbath, it will be of interest to know the facts. The day on which Pentecost was celebrated depends altogether upon the day of the week on which the Passover fell on any given year. The Passover lamb was to be killed on the evening of the 14th of Nisan, and beginning with the 15th day unleavened bread was eaten for seven days. The first and seventh days of the feast were sabbaths, in which no servile work should be done. Ex. 12:6, 15, 16; Lev. 23:5-7. On the morrow after this first sabbath—the 16th—the wave-sheaf (or "omer," margin) of the first-fruits was offered to the Lord, and from this day they were to count fifty days to Pentecost. Lev. 23:10, 11, 15, 16.

Jesus was crucified on Friday (Luke 23:54), and ate the Passover with His disciples the evening before (Luke 22:7-15), which would be the 14th. Sabbath therefore was the 16th of Nisan, and fifty days would bring Pentecost that year on the Sabbath.

There has been much discussion over the question of whether Jesus did not eat the Passover one day before the regular time, so that He would be crucified on the day on which the typical lamb was slain. "The question, on what day of the week this Pentecost fell, must of course be determined by the mode in which the doubt is solved regarding the day [of the month] on which the Last Supper was eaten. If it was the legal paschal supper, on the 14th of Nisan, and the Sabbath during which our Lord lay in the grave was the day of the omer, Pentecost must have followed on the Sabbath. But if the supper was eaten on the 13th, and He was crucified on the 14th, the Sunday of the resurrection must have been the day of the omer, and Pentecost must have occurred on the first day of the week."—"Smith's Bible Dictionary," article "Pentecost."

Andrews, after considering all the evidences on this question, concludes that Jesus ate the Passover at the regular time and was crucified on the 15th. ("Life of our Lord," page 460.) With him agree Edersheim, Neander, Burton and Matthews, Hastings's Bible Dictionary, and many other authorities. This seems to be the only position the Scripture warrants.

2. This was the baptism of the Holy Spirit promised by Jesus. It filled the room, and it filled and took possession of the believers. "On the day of Pentecost the Infinite One revealed Himself in power to the church. By His Holy Spirit He descended from the heights of heaven as a rushing, mighty wind, to the room in which the disciples were assembled. It was as if for ages this influence had been held in restraint, and now heaven rejoiced in being able to pour upon the church the riches of the Spirit's power. And, under the influence of the Spirit, words of penitence and confession were mingled with songs of praise for sins forgiven. Words of thanksgiving and of prophecy were heard. All heaven bent low to behold and to adore the wisdom of matchless, incomprehensible Love. Lost in wonder, the apostles and disciples exclaimed, 'Herein is love.' 1 John 4:10. They grasped the imparted gift. And what followed?—Thousands were converted in a day. The sword of the Spirit, newly edged with power, and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way through unbelief."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 7, page 31.

3. "The work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost. As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given at its close, for the ripening of the harvest. The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the message from Heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers. Satan also works with lying wonders, even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men. Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their stand."—"Great Controversy," pages 611, 612.

4. "Why has the history of the work of the disciples, as they labored with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the Holy Spirit, been recorded, if it is not that from this record the Lord's people to-day are to gain an inspiration to work earnestly for Him? What the Lord did for His people in that time, it is just as essential, and more so, that He do for His people to-day. All that the apostles did, every church-member to-day is to do. And we are to work with as much more fervor, to be accompanied by the Holy Spirit in as much greater measure, as the increase of wickedness demands a more decided call to repentance."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 7, page 33.

"The Spirit awaits our demand and reception."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 131.

5. "Already many are receiving the Holy Spirit, and no longer will the way be blocked by listless indifference."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 7, page 33.
