## Notes

1. In this and the preceding verse Stephen shows his hearers that it was Christ who led the children of Israel; and that Moses, whom they professed to follow, foretold His coming in person as the Deliverer of His people.

2. "You have carried your idolatrous images about; and I will carry you into captivity, and see if the gods in whom ye have trusted can deliver you from My hands. Instead of 'beyond Babylon,' Amos, from whom the quotation is made, says I will carry you beyond Damascus. Where they were carried was into Assyria and Media, (see 2 Kings 17:6); now, this was not only beyond Damascus, but beyond Babylon itself; and, as Stephen knew this to be the fact, he states it here, and thus more precisely fixes the place of their captivity."—Clarke's Commentary.

3. The Jews were trusting in externals. Stephen doubtless meant to show them that just as their fathers had with them the "tabernacle of witness," a continual witness or proof of God's presence, and yet went into idolatry, so they with the temple and with even the Messiah among them had rejected God. He had been accused of blasphemy against Moses, the law, and the temple. He has shown his respect for Moses and the law, and now he shows that he had no intention of speaking with disrespect of the temple.

"Jesus" in verse 45 is the Greek form of the word Joshua. See Heb. 4:8, margin.

4. "When Stephen had reached this point there was a tumult among the people. The prisoner read his fate in the countenances before him. He perceived the resistance that met his words, which were spoken at the dictation of the Holy Ghost. He knew that he was giving his last testimony. Few who read this address of Stephen properly appreciate it. The occasion, the time and place should be borne in mind to make his words convey their full significance. When he connected Jesus Christ with the prophecies, and spoke of the temple as he did, the priest, affecting to be horror-stricken, rent his robe. This act was to Stephen a signal that his voice would soon be silenced forever. Although he was just in the midst of his sermon, he abruptly concluded it by suddenly breaking away from the chain of history, and, turning upon his infuriated judges, said, 'Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,'" etc.—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 297, 298.

5. "At this the priests and rulers were beside themselves with anger. They were more like wild beasts of prey than like human beings. They rushed upon Stephen, gnashing their teeth. But he was not intimidated; he had expected this. His face was calm, and shone with an angelic light. The infuriated priests and the excited mob had no terrors for him. 'But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven.'

"The scene about him faded from his vision; the gates of heaven were ajar, and Stephen, looking in, saw the glory of the courts of God, and Christ, as if just risen from His throne, standing ready to sustain His servant, who was about to suffer martyrdom for His name. When Stephen proclaimed the glorious scene opened before him, it was more than his persecutors could endure. They stopped their ears, that they might not hear his words, and uttering loud cries ran furiously upon him with one accord."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 298, 299.
