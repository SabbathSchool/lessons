# TRUE EDUCATION READER SERIES

## Books One to Seven

As the first years of school life have the greatest influence on the character of the child, much care should be used in selecting the reading lessons to be placed in the hands of the pupil. The vital, living truths contained in the Scriptures are essential to the formation of sound characters; therefore the lessons in the first three Readers are quite largely developed from Bible themes, in story form.

THE FIRST READER gives the story in a very simple style, fixing upon the child's mind in his first school year the beautiful Gospel story from Creation to Redemption.

THE SECOND READER follows the same general line, with several additional topics especially interesting to children.

THE THIRD READER again repeats the Gospel story in a little different setting, and is still further enriched by the addition of biographical sketches, parables of Jesus, and simple lessons in physiology, geography, and botany.

BOOK FOUR embraces a wider variety of subjects, introducing the pupil, by short biographies, to many of the best known characters of history. Interesting Bible stories are also used in this Reader, with themes more fully developed. Some of the most wonderful inventions are brought before the student in a way to be easily understood and greatly appreciated. The study of nature and science is encouraged by fascinating stories of animals and birds, and by sketches of a more scientific nature but no less interesting.

BOOK FIVE is a little higher development of the same general plan. Many of the simpler literary gems are introduced, and Bible stories are also used quite freely.

BOOK SIX is still in preparation, but will doubtless be ready for the beginning of the next school year.

BOOK SEVEN is quite largely made up of selections from the best authors, including the Bible and our best denominational writers. More attention is given to vocal physiology and voice training, and the lessons are arranged in a way to develop the natural ability of the student. Like all the Readers, this book contains many selections from the best poetry of the English language.

This series is beautifully illustrated, and bound in a very substantial and attractive style.
