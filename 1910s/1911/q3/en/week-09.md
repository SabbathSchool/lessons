### LESSON SCRIPTURE

### GENERAL NOTE
In this lesson we begin a study of Paul's third missionary journey, which covered about four years, A.D. 54 to 58. Some of the early churches were visited. This journey covered "a long residence at Ephesus, where he had spent a brief time on his return from the second journey; probably missionary expeditions from this center into the province of Asia, founding the seven churches of Asia mentioned in Revelation, and Colossae up the valley of the Lycus. He also revisited Corinth and the churches of Macedonia during the last year, touching at Miletus as he sailed for Palestine and Jerusalem. His arrest at Jerusalem prevented his returning to the point of his departure, — Antioch in Syria.

"During this journey were written the 1 Corinthians, from Ephesus A.D. 57; 2 Corinthians, probably from Philippi A.D. 58; Galatians, from Corinth A.D. 58; and Romans, from Corinth A.D. 58." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1897.

### Notes

1. "It was at this time that Apollos, an Alexandrian Jew, visited Ephesus. He had received the highest Grecian culture, and was a scholar and an orator. He had heard the teachings of John the Baptist, had received the baptism of repentance, and was a living witness that the work of the prophet was not in vain. Apollos was a thorough student of the prophecies, and an able expounder of the Scriptures, publicly proclaiming his faith in Christ, as far as he himself had received the light.

"Aquila and Priscilla listened to him, and saw that his teachings were defective. He had not a thorough knowledge of the mission of Christ, His resurrection and ascension, and of the work of His Spirit, the Comforter which He sent down to remain with His people during His absence. They accordingly sent for Apollos, and the educated orator received instruction from them with grateful surprise and joy. Through their teachings he obtained a clearer understanding of the Scriptures, and became one of the ablest defenders of the Christian church." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 119.

2. "This providential meeting with Aquila and Priscilla in Asia became the means of promoting the spread of the gospel in Achaia. Now that Apollos was made fully acquainted with the Christian doctrine, his zeal urged him to go where it had been firmly established by an apostle. ... The Christians of Ephesus encouraged him in this intention, and gave him 'letters of commendation' to their brethren across the Aegean. On his arrival at Corinth, he threw himself at once among those Jews who had rejected Paul, and argued with them publicly and zealously on the ground of their Scriptures, and thus became 'a valuable support to those who had already believed through the grace of God;' for he proved with power that Jesus who had been crucified at Jerusalem, and whom Paul was proclaiming throughout the world, was indeed the Christ." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 388.

3. "His success in preaching the gospel led some of the church to exalt his labors above those of Paul, while he himself was working in harmony with Paul for the advancement of the cause. This rival spirit threatened to greatly hinder the progress of truth. Paul had purposely presented the gospel to the Corinthians in its veriest simplicity. Disappointed with the result of his labors at Athens, where he had brought his learning and eloquence to bear upon his hearers, he determined to pursue an entirely different course at Corinth. He presented there the plain, simple truth, unadorned with worldly wisdom, and studiously dwelt upon Christ, and His mission to the world. The eloquent discourses of Apollos, and his manifest learning, were contrasted by his hearers with the purposely simple and unadorned preaching of Paul." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 120.

4. "There are many at the present day who have unwittingly violated one of the precepts of God's law. When the understanding is enlightened, and the claims of the fourth commandment are urged upon the conscience, they see themselves sinners in the sight of God. 'Sin is the transgression of the law,' and 'He that shall offend in one point is guilty of all.' The honest seeker after truth will not plead ignorance of the law as an excuse for transgression. Light was within his reach. God's word is plain, and Christ has bidden him search the Scriptures. He reveres God's law as holy, just, and good, and he repents of his transgression. By faith he pleads the atoning blood of Christ, and grasps the promise of pardon. His former baptism does not satisfy him now. He has seen himself a sinner, condemned by the law of God. He has experienced anew a death to sin, and he desires again to be buried with Christ by baptism, that he may rise to walk in newness of life. Such a course is in harmony with the example of Paul in baptizing the Jewish converts. That incident was recorded by the Holy Spirit as an instructive lesson for the church." — Id., page 133.

5. "This school 'was probably a lecture-room, which, as the private property of the owner, was lent or let to the apostle.' Ramsay suggests that it was the lecture-room used by the professors of rhetoric and philosophy a part of the day, and Paul at other hours." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1909.

6. "The manifestations of supernatural power which accompanied the apostle's work, were calculated to make a deep impression upon a people given to sorcery, and priding themselves upon their intercourse with invisible beings. The miracles of Paul were far more potent than had ever before been witnessed in Ephesus, and were of such a character that they could not be imitated by the skill of the juggler or the enchantments of the sorcerer. Thus the Lord exalted His servant, even in the estimation of the idolaters themselves, immeasurably above the most favored and powerful of the magicians." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 135, 136.

7. "The discomfiture and humiliation of those who had profaned the name of Jesus, soon became known throughout Ephesus, by Jews and Gentiles. Unmistakable proof had been given of the sacredness of that name, and the peril which they incurred who should invoke it while they had no faith in Christ's divine mission. Terror seized the minds of many, and the work of the gospel was regarded by all with awe and reverence." — Id., pages 136, 137.

8. "They did not sell them [the books] for others to use, as they might have done, but destroyed the instruments of evil at great cost, reckoned at fifty thousand pieces of silver, Latin, denarii, Greek, drachmas, worth about 16 cents each, or $8,000 in all. But in those days a drachma was equivalent to a day's wage, so that the sum was equivalent to $50,000 to $100,000 in our time." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1909.
