### Notes

1. "Paul had ever exalted the divine law. He had presented before the people their great sin in transgressing its precepts, and their duty to repent of such transgression. He had showed them that there was in law no power to save them from the penalty of disobedience. While they should repent of their sins, and humble themselves before God, whose holy law they had broken, and whose just wrath they had thus incurred, they must exercise faith in the blood of Christ as their only ground of pardon. ... By repentance and faith they might be free from the condemnation of sin, and through the grace of Christ be enabled henceforth to render obedience to the law of God." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 190.

2. "Paul had not designed to bear this testimony; but while he was speaking the Spirit of inspiration came upon him, confirming his former fears that this would be his last meeting with his Ephesian brethren. He therefore left with them his counsel and admonition as his will and testament to be carried out by them when they should see him no more." — Id., pages 199, 200.

3. "Could ministers of the gospel constantly bear in mind that they are dealing with the purchase of the blood of Christ, they would have a deeper sense of the solemn importance of their work. They are to take heed unto themselves and to the flock. Their own example must illustrate and enforce their instructions. Those who teach others the way of life should be careful to give no occasion for the truth to be evil spoken of. As representatives of Christ, they are to maintain the honor of His name. By their devotion, their purity of life, their godly conversation, they should prove themselves worthy of their calling. By right example they may exert an influence which words alone could not have, to encourage faith and holiness, fervent love, devotion, and integrity among those for whom they labor." — Id., pages 200, 201.

4. "They were gathered together — probably in some solitary spot upon the shore — to listen to his address. This little company formed a singular contrast with the crowds which used to assemble at the times of public amusement in the theater of Miletus. But that vast theater is now a silent ruin, while the words spoken by a care-worn traveler to a few despised strangers are still living as they were that day, to teach lessons for all time and to make known eternal truths to all who will hear them, while they reveal to us, as though they were merely human words, all the tenderness and the affection of Paul, the individual speaker." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 526.

"Sadly the disciples followed him to the ship, their hearts filled with anxiety, both for his future and for their own. The apostle's tears flowed freely as he parted from these brethren, and after he had embarked there came to him from the shore the sound of weeping. With heavy hearts the elders turned homeward, knowing that they could expect no further help from him who had felt so deep an interest and labored with so great zeal for them and for the church under their care." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 202, 203.
