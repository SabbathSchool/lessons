### Notes

1. We are here brought in our study to the end of Paul's first missionary journey. Barnabas accompanied him on this tour. "They had been absent, as Ramsay calculates, above two years, leaving Antioch in spring and returning in the third summer or autumn following." — "Dictionary of the Bible" (Hastings), page 705.

2. "No age, however, of Christianity, not even the earliest, has been without its difficulties, controversies, and corruptions. The presence of Judas among the apostles, and of Ananias and Sapphira among the first disciples, were proofs of the power which moral evil possesses to combine itself with the holiest works. The misunderstanding of 'the Grecians and Hebrews' in the days of Stephen, the suspicion of the apostles when Paul came from Damascus to Jerusalem, the secession of Mark at the beginning of the first missionary journey, were symptoms of the prejudice, ignorance, and infirmity in the midst of which the gospel was to win its way in the hearts of men. And the arrival of the apostles at Antioch at the close of their journey was presently followed by a troubled controversy which involved the most momentous consequences to all future ages of the church, and which led to that visit to Jerusalem which, next after his conversion, is perhaps the most important passage in Paul's life." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 177.

3. "The matter resulted in much discussion and want of harmony in the church, until finally the church at Antioch, apprehending that a division among them would occur from any further discussion of the question, decided to send Paul and Barnabas, together with some responsible men of Antioch, to Jerusalem, to lay the matter before the apostles and elders. There they were to meet delegates from the different churches, and those who had come to attend the approaching annual festivals. Meanwhile all controversy was to cease until a final decision should be made by the responsible men of the church. This decision was then to be universally accepted by the various churches throughout the country." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 63.

4. "Some of the 'false brethren' (for such is the name which Paul gives to the Judaizers) went down 'from Judea' to Antioch. The course they adopted in the first instance, was not that of open antagonism to Paul, but rather of clandestine intrigue. They came as 'spies' into an enemy's camp, creeping in 'unawares,' that they might ascertain how far the Jewish law had been relaxed by the Christians at Antioch, their purpose being to bring the whole church, if possible, under the 'bondage' of the Jewish yoke. ... They did not merely recommend or enjoin, for prudential reasons, the continuance of certain ceremonies in themselves indifferent, but they said, 'Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye can not be saved.' Such a doctrine must have been instantly opposed by Paul with his utmost energy. He was always ready to go to the extreme verge of charitable concession when the question was one of peace and mutual understanding; but when the very foundations of Christianity were in danger of being undermined, when the very continuance of 'the truth of the gospel' was in jeopardy, it was impossible that he should 'give place by subjection,' even 'for an hour.'" — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 183.

5. "This yoke was not the law of ten commandments, as those who oppose the binding claim of the law assert; but Peter referred to the law of ceremonies, which was made null and void by the crucifixion of Christ. This address of Peter brought the assembly to a point where they could listen with reason to Paul and Barnabas, who related their experience in working among the Gentiles. 'Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.'" — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 68.
