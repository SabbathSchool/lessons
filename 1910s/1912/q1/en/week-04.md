### Notes

1. No one can look for an event which they do not expect, or believe to be near.

2. The fact that people are doubting the promise of the Lord's coming is clear evidence that some are proclaiming the event, and directing the attention of the people to the promise of His return, and warning them to get ready for this glorious event. Some will scoff, but others will receive the message with joy.

3. Matthew says the signs in the heavens would appear "immediately after the tribulation." Mark says, "after that tribulation." The "tribulation" here mentioned is no doubt that long period of "time and times and the dividing of times," or "forty and two months" — 1260 days, or years — in which the papal power was to make war on the saints and blaspheme God. See Dan. 7:25 and Rev. 13:5. This period ended in 1798. By means of the Reformation the persecution ended before the period itself expired. Immediately following the close of the persecution the sun was to be darkened.

4. **THE SUN**

"The 19th of May, 1780, was unprecedented in New England for its great darkness... The darkness extended over several thousand square miles, though differing much in intensity in different places. Nowhere, perhaps, was it greater than in this vicinity. The day was appropriately called and is still known as THE DARK DAY." — From "History of the Town of Hampton, New Hampshire," by Joseph Dorr, Salem, Massachusetts, printed by the Salem Press and Printing Company, 1893, volume 1, page 217. (Boston Public Library.)

"There appears to have been absence of clouds for the most part, though light rain occurred. Though known as the 'Black Friday of New England,' the area covered by darkness also extended west of that section." — "Encyclopedia Americana," the Americana Company, New York, 1903, article "Dark Day."

**THE MOON**

"The darkness of the following evening was probably as deep and dense as ever had been observed since the Almighty first gave birth to light; it wanted only palpability to render it as extraordinary as that which overspread the land of Egypt in the days of Moses. If every luminous body in the universe had been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of existence, it was thought the darkness could not have been more complete. A sheet of white paper, held within a few inches of the eyes, was equally invisible with the blackest velvet." — Article by R. M. Downs, "Our First Century," 1776-1876; "Great and Memorable Events," pages 89-96. (Boston Public Library.)

**THE STARS**

"Compared with the splendors of this celestial exhibition, the most brilliant rockets and fireworks of art bore less relation than the twinkling of the most tiny star to the broad glare of the sun. The whole heavens seemed in motion, and little need have been borrowed from the morbid sensibility, to imagine that the opening of the sixth seal was indeed at hand when the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. Never before has it fallen to our lot to observe a phenomenon so magnificent and sublime." — New York "Commercial Advertiser," quoted in the "Eastern Argus" (Portland, Maine) of November 18, 1833.

"We pronounce the raining fire which we saw on Wednesday morning last an awful type — a sure forerunner — a merciful sign of that great and dreadful day which the inhabitants of the earth will witness when the sixth seal shall be opened.

"That time is just at hand described not only in the New Testament but in the Old; and a more correct picture of a fig-tree casting its leaves when blown by a mighty wind, it was not possible to behold.

"Many things now occurring upon the earth tend to convince us that we are in the 'latter days.' This exhibition we deem to be a type of an awful day fast hurrying upon us. This is our sincere opinion; and what we think, we are not ashamed to tell." — The "Old Countryman," New York, printed in the "New York Star" and quoted in the Portland "Evening Advertiser," November 26, 1833. (Portland Public Library.)

5. "December 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the shaking of the powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord said 'heaven,' in giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, He meant heaven, and when He said 'earth' He meant earth. The powers of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. They rule in the heavens. The powers of earth are those that rule on the earth. The powers of heaven will be shaken at the voice of God. Then the sun, moon, and stars will be moved out of their places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of God." — "Early Writings," by Mrs. E. G. White, old edition, part 1, page 33; new edition, page 41.
