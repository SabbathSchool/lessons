# Lesson 6 — The Binding of Satan; the Millennium
## February 10, 1912

### LESSON HELPS
"Great Controversy," chapters 29, 41; the Sabbath School Worker.

### GENERAL NOTE
The word millennium is from two Latin words, mille, thousand, and annus, year, and means a thousand years. Any period of a thousand years is a millennium. This special period is mentioned in the Bible in Revelation 20, and the statement is made that Satan is bound during that time. This lesson is devoted largely to a study of this scripture.

### Notes

1. When Satan sinned, he with all his sympathizers was cast out of heaven to this earth. When man sinned, he lost his life, and the dominion given him passed into the hands of Satan, who became the ruler of this world. During all the centuries till Jesus hung upon the cross, Satan kept his real purpose covered, so that even the unfallen angels did not understand. But when Jesus died on the cross, Satan was again cast down, and the second Adam became the rightful representative of this world.

"Satan saw that his disguise was torn away. His administration was laid open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe. He had revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Henceforth his work was restricted. Whatever attitude he might assume, he could no longer await the angels as they came from the heavenly courts, and before them accuse Christ's brethren of being clothed with the garments of blackness and the defilement of sin. The last link of sympathy between Satan and the heavenly world was broken." — "Desire of Ages," page 761.

2. The word here translated "bottomless pit" is in the Revised Version, Rotherham's translation, interlinear, etc., properly translated "abyss," meaning a place of darkness and desolation. A like expression is found in the Septuagint (Greek version) of Gen. 1:2, where our English version says "deep." "Darkness was upon the face of the deep," is the description of the earth in its chaotic condition. It denotes the same here.

3. No more fitting term than "abyss," or "bottomless pit," could be found to describe the earth in its desolate condition. Here will be Satan's home for a thousand years. All about him he will see only failure and ruin.

"Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years. Here he will be confined, to wander up and down over the broken surface of the earth, and see the effects of his rebellion against God's law. For a thousand years he can enjoy the fruit of the curse which he has caused. Limited alone to the earth, he will not have the privilege of ranging to other planets, to tempt and annoy those who have not fallen." — "Early Writings," by Mrs. E. G. White, old edition, part 3, page 150; new edition, page 290.

4. This judgment will not be to determine who are the righteous, for this has previously been determined, but it will consist in apportioning the measure of punishment due to the lost. There will be degrees in the reward of the lost (Mark 6:11), for all will be rewarded according as their works have been. This work will bring to light the hidden things, and the justice and mercy of God will be fully seen in all His dealings with the children of men.

5. The millennial period is located by events so great that there can be no mistaking the time. It is marked at both its beginning and its close by a resurrection — the righteous dead at the commencement, the wicked dead at the close. The millennium therefore begins at the second coming of the Lord. During the thousand years the earth is entirely depopulated, and in a chaotic condition. How absurd to claim that during this period there will be a second probation!

But other scriptures state the same thing in other words. The scriptures show absolutely that when Christ comes, the living righteous are translated, and the righteous dead raised in the first resurrection, and that the wicked are slain by the glory of His coming, so that Satan can not further deceive them. The time when they are beyond his power is plainly stated to be a thousand years. "And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations," which is plainly to say that "the rest of the dead," the wicked, do live again when the thousand years are finished, just as verse 5 declares.

The "Millennial Dawn" advocates seek to parry the force of this scripture by claiming that the words, "But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished," are spurious. But there is no authority for discrediting the genuineness of the text. The English edition of the Revised Version makes no reference to this text as being "not found" in ancient Greek manuscripts. The American Revised Version, which is admitted by the ripest scholars in the land to be the best translation of the Holy Scriptures extant, does not give the slightest hint that a part of the text is omitted in the "most reliable Greek manuscripts." Rotherham's translation, another excellent work, though noting elsewhere "doubtful" renderings, says nothing about the text's being spurious. The Interlinear translation also puts this text on the same basis as other portions of the Holy Scriptures. It is found in Young's translation also, without any hint of its being some "marginal comment." Sawyer's translation contains it, also the Twentieth Century New Testament. In the translation from the Greek text of Von Tischendorf it is found unquestioned. The Emphatic Diaglott, based on Griesbach's text, gives this verse, and in a foot-note says: "These words ['the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished'] were probably omitted by oversight in Vatican manuscript [No. 1160], as they are found in A, B, C, though not in the Syriac." By "A" is meant Codex Alexandrinus; by "B," Codex Vaticanus, No. 2066, of the seventh or eighth century; by "C," Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus. Neither Dr. Adam Clarke nor Bliss, in their comments on this scripture, offer any objection to its genuineness. Finally, the best Greek text, that of Westcott and Hort, contains the passage, and neither have the Revised Versions or any of the critics, so far as we know, even questioned it. The revisers adopted for their revision the text "for which the evidence is decidedly preponderating," and when that differed from the Greek text "from which the Authorized Version was made," the rule was that "the alteration be expressed in the margin." (See Preface to Revised New Testament, division 2, paragraph 4.) But there is not even an indication of doubt over Rev. 20:5.
