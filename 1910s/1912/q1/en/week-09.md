### Notes

1. "Because the Sabbath was made for man, it is the Lord's day. It belongs to Christ. For 'all things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.' Since He made all things, He made the Sabbath. By Him it was set apart as a memorial of the work of creation. It points to Him as both the Creator and the Sanctifier. It declares that He who created all things in heaven and in earth, and by whom all things hold together, is the head of the church, and that by His power we are reconciled to God." — "Desire of Ages," page 288.

2. The Sabbath is founded on the facts of creation: The Creator worked six days, rested on the seventh, then blessed and hallowed the seventh day. These facts are unchangeable; therefore the Sabbath is unchangeable.

3. The division of time into months and years is indicated by nature. But not so with the week. This division is made only by the Sabbath. The fact that there were recognized periods of seven days, or a week, shows that the Sabbath was known and kept.

"The week, another primeval measure, is not a natural measure of time, as some astronomers and chronologers have supposed, indicated by the phases or quarters of the moon. It was originated by divine appointment at the creation for man's physical and spiritual well-being." — "Bliss's Sacred Chronology," page 6; "Hale's Chronology," volume 1, page 19.

"Seven has been the ancient and honored number among the nations of the earth. They have measured their time by weeks from the beginning. The original of this was the Sabbath of God, as Moses has given the reasons of it in his writings." — "Brief Dissertation on the First Three Chapters of Genesis," by Dr. Coleman, page 26.

4. There is no difference, or contradiction, between the reason here assigned for observing the Sabbath, and the reason assigned in the fourth commandment of the decalogue. Creation is an act of God. The deliverance of Israel from Egypt was a manifestation of the same power as is seen in the creation of the world. So is conversion. 2 Cor. 5:17. The Sabbath is a memorial of God's power; and wherever there is seen a special manifestation of His power, we are called upon to observe the Sabbath as a remembrance of the creative power of God, and thus worship and reverence the true God.
