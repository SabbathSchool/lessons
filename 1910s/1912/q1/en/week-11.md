### Notes

1. The three kingdoms which were plucked up by this power were the Heruli, under Odoacer, the Vandals, and the Ostrogoths. See "Elliott's Horæ Apocalypticæ, third edition, volume 3, page 141, note 1.

Surely no better symbol of the papacy could have been chosen than this. Eyes, keen, intelligent, and cunning, like the eyes of a man, a mouth pouring forth blasphemy. This foreshadows with remarkable accuracy the shrewd, deceptive working of the man of sin.

2. The exceedingly wicked and arrogant character of this power is set forth in the words, "He shall speak great words against the Most High."

"Hear Felinus: 'The pope sustains Christ's lieutenantship, not only over things in heaven, over things in earth, and over things in hell, but also over the angels, both the good and bad.' Hear Antoninus, the archbishop of Florence: 'The pope's power is greater than all other created power, in some sense reaching unto things in heaven, things in earth, and things in hell; so that of that power the words may be verified which are written by the prophet David, "Thou hast put all things under His feet."' Hear the voice of the Lateran councils: 'All power is given to thee [the pope] in heaven and in earth!' Hear the decretals from popes themselves: 'It is idolatry to disobey his command.' 'We, who, according to the plenitude of our power, have right to dispense above law or right.' 'We declare, say, define, pronounce it to be necessary to salvation for every human creature to be subject to the Roman pontiff.' And, finally, hear Cardinal Bellarmine himself: 'If the pope should err by enjoining vices or forbidding virtues, the church should be bound to believe the vices to be good and the virtues to be evil, unless it would sin against conscience.' Great God! how are here Thy titles, Thy prerogatives, wrested from Thee by this arch-apostasy! How is here Thy dominion universal usurped! Thy homage stolen! Thy moral government challenged!" — "Romanism and Anglo-Catholicism," J. Sortain, A.B., London, 1841, pages 84-87.

The persecuting character of this power is foreshadowed in the words "and shall wear out the saints of the Most High." "Under these bloody maxims [already cited at considerable length] those persecutions were carried on, from the eleventh and twelfth centuries almost to the present day, which stand out on the page of history. After the signal of open martyrdom had been given in the canons of Orleans, there followed the extirpation of the Albigenses, under the form of a crusade, the establishment of the Inquisition, the cruel attempts to extinguish the Waldenses, the martyrdoms of the Lollards, the cruel wars to exterminate the Bohemians, the burning of Huss and Jerome, and multitudes of other confessors, before the Reformation; and afterward, the ferocious cruelties practised in the Netherlands, the martyrdoms of Queen Mary's reign, the extinction, by fire and sword, of the Reformation in Spain and Italy, by fraud and open persecution in Poland, the massacre of Bartholomew, the persecutions of the Huguenots by the League, the extirpation of the Vaudois, and all the cruelties and perjuries connected with the revocation of the edict of Nantes. These are the more open and conspicuous facts which explain the prophecy, besides the slow and secret murders of the holy tribunal of the Inquisition." — "The First Two Visions of Daniel," T. B. Birks, London, 1845, pages 248, 249.

3. The commandments of God as found in "Bellarmine's Dottrina Christiana Breve; or Short Christian Doctrine," pages 23, 24, which was printed at Rome in 1836, "con licenza de superiori," and is here translated from the original Italian, will be of interest:

"Repeat the ten commandments.
"1. I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have none other god before Me.
"2. Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain.
"3. Remember to keep holy the festivals.
"4. Honor thy father and thy mother.
"5. Do not kill.
"6. Do not commit adultery.
"7. Do not steal.
"8. Do not bear false witness.
"9. Do not covet thy neighbor's wife.
"10. Do not covet thy neighbor's goods."

"It is a poor apology for this expurgation of the decalogue, that it is not so done in the Douay Bible: for when these catechisms were introduced, and even yet in most Catholic countries, not one layman in a thousand ever read that Bible; the catechism intended for universal consumption contained all his knowledge of God's law. What myriads, then, through this fraud, must have lived and died in the belief that the second commandment was no part of God's law! It is clearly proved, that the pastors of the church have struck out one of God's ten WORDS; which not only in the Old Testament, but in all revelation, are the most emphatically regarded as the synopsis of all religion and morality." — Alexander Campbell in "Campbell and Purcell Debate," page 214.

4. "The following instruction on the third [fourth] commandment is taken from 'A New Catechism of Christian Doctrine and Practise,' by the Rt. Rev. James Bellord, D.D., Titular Bishop of Milevis; the authorized American edition with the imprint 'Ave Maria, Notre Dame, Ind.,' 1907:

"'What day was the Sabbath?'
"'The seventh day; our Saturday.'
"'Do you keep the Sabbath?'
"'No: we keep the Lord's day.'
"'Which is that?'
"'The first day: Sunday.'
"'Who changed it?'
"'The Catholic Church.'"

"Is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday, to abstain on that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify." — "The Faith of Our Fathers," by Cardinal Gibbons, Baltimore, John Murphy & Co., 1893, page 111.

5. The first recorded law for Sunday observance was enacted by the emperor Constantine, A.D. 321. The law reads as follows: "Let all the judges and townpeople and the occupation of all trades rest on the venerable day of the sun; but let those who are situated in the country freely and at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture; because it often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines; lest the critical moment being let slip, men should lose the commodities granted by Heaven."
