## Topical Studies on the Message
### First Quarter, 1912

### Introductory Note

For six months the lessons for all divisions of the Sabbath-school will be topical studies, covering many of the doctrinal features of present truth. This is the first time we have ever had uniform study in all divisions on these topics, and these lessons should be a great blessing to our people everywhere. The distinctive features of the message should always be interesting to those who love it, and to thousands who have embraced it in more recent years they will be of special interest.

It has been suggested that during the period covered by these lessons there be a general revival of missionary work in all our churches and Sabbath-schools, and that these lessons be used as a basis for Bible studies with our neighbors and friends. We believe the suggestion is a good one, and hope that it will be put into practical operation.
