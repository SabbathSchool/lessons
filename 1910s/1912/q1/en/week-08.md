### Notes

1. The law of God is but an expression of the thought of God. The following comparisons are of interest, showing that the decalogue is but a reflection of the character of its Author:

| CHRIST | THE LAW |
|--------|---------|
| Christ is "truth." John 14:6. | The law is "truth." Ps. 119:142. |
| Christ is "holy." Acts 4:27. | The law is "holy." Rom. 7:12. |
| Christ is "perfect." Heb. 5:9. | The law is "perfect." Ps. 19:7. |
| Christ is "righteousness." 1 Cor. 1:30. | The law is "righteousness." Ps. 119:172. |
| Christ is "light." John 8:12. | The law is "light." Prov. 6:23. |
| Christ "abideth ever." John 8:35. | The law "stands fast forever." Ps. 111:7, 8. |
| Christ in the heart. Eph. 3:17. | The law in the heart. Heb. 8:10. |
| Freedom in Christ. John 8:36. | Liberty in obeying the law. Ps. 119:45. |
| Rejecting Christ brings wrath. John 3:36. | Breaking the law brings wrath. Neh. 13:18. |
| To be judged by Christ's word. John 12:48. | To be judged by the law. James 2:12. |

2. As sin can only be imputed when there is law, and as sin was imputed from the beginning, even in the Garden of Eden, it follows therefore that all the law existed in principle from the beginning. These principles have existed from eternity, and angels and unfallen beings are subject to them.

3. "I was also shown a sanctuary upon the earth containing two apartments. It resembled the one in heaven, and I was told that it was a figure of the heavenly. The furniture of the first apartment of the earthly sanctuary was like that in the first apartment of the heavenly. The veil was lifted, and I looked into the holy of holies, and saw that the furniture was the same as in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary. The priest ministered in both apartments of the earthly. He went daily into the first apartment, but entered the most holy only once a year, to cleanse it from the sins which had been conveyed there. I saw that Jesus ministered in both apartments of the heavenly sanctuary." — "Early Writings," Mrs. E. G. White, old edition, part 3, pages 115, 116; new edition, pages 252, 253.

"It was represented to me that the remnant followed Jesus into the most holy place, and beheld the ark and the mercy-seat, and were captivated with their glory. Jesus then raised the cover of the ark, and lo! the tables of stone, with the ten commandments written upon them. They trace down the lively oracles, but start back with trembling when they see the fourth commandment among the ten holy precepts, with a brighter light shining upon it than upon the other nine, and a halo of glory all around it. They find nothing there informing them that the Sabbath has been abolished, or changed to the first day of the week." — Id., old edition, part 3, pages 117, 118; new edition, page 255.
