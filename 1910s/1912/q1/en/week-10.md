### Notes

1. In this text the Sabbath is mentioned, and six other days of the week, which are called "working days." One of these must be the first day of the week. The first day of the week is therefore named by an inspired writer, not the Sabbath, or a rest day, but a "working" day.

2. That the apostles did not meet on this occasion to commemorate the resurrection is evident from the fact that they did not believe that Jesus was risen from the dead. They were simply having an evening meal at their own home. See Acts 1:12, 13.

3. Three days are here mentioned: (a) the preparation day; (b) the Sabbath; (c) the first day of the week. No clearer statement could be made that the first day of the week is not the Sabbath.

4. No sacred title is here applied to the first day of the week. It was an evening meeting, held on what is now called Saturday night. After restoring Eutychus to life, Paul continued the meeting till break of day, and early, on what we would now call Sunday, left on foot for Assos to meet his companions who had gone on by boat.

5. The following comment on this text is of interest, and shows that this scripture has no reference whatever to a public collection in the church:

"The whole question turns upon the meaning of the expression, 'by him;' and I marvel greatly how you can imagine that it means 'in the collection box of the congregation.' Greenfield, in his lexicon, translates the Greek term, 'with one's self, i.e., at home.' Two Latin versions, the Vulgate and that of Castellio, render it, 'apud se,' with one's self; at home. Three French translations, those of Martin, Osterwald, and De Sacy, 'chez soi,' at his own house; at home. The German of Luther, 'bei sich selbt,' by himself; at home. The Dutch, 'by heinselven,' same as the German. The Italian of Diodati, 'appresso di se,' in his own presence; at home. The Spanish of Felippe Scio, 'en su casa,' in his own house. The Portuguese of Ferreira, 'para isso,' with himself. The Swedish, 'nær sig self,' near himself." — "Vindication of the True Sabbath," third edition, pages 51, 52.
