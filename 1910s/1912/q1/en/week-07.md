# Lesson 7 — The Law of God
## February 17, 1912

### LESSON HELPS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," chapter 27; the Sabbath School Worker.

### GENERAL NOTE
The decalogue, spoken by the voice of God, is a marvel in its comprehensiveness. In principle it comprehends every wrong to be avoided, every duty to be performed, every sin to be shunned. It is an epitome of all moral truth, forbidding all that is injurious, and enjoining all that is for the good of man. It is a heaven-born code, the principles of which are universal and eternal, and binding upon all creatures of God's everlasting kingdom.

### Notes

1. "There is a winsome picture of God in the preface to these commandments. It is often omitted in copies in church buildings and elsewhere. That is always unfortunate. A warm personal positive precedes these negatives. 'I am' comes before 'thou shalt not.' Let a man get a good glimpse of God, and he is eager for suggestions on how not to lose that sight. The voice out of the mount said, 'I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out;' and that wonderful midnight, that Red Sea victory, the sweetened waters, and the new daily food, gave fine coloring and glow to the words as they fell upon these people's eager ears." — S. D. Gordan, in "Sunday School Times," July 14, 1907.

2. One of the interesting coincidences in the Bible is seen in this scripture. In Ex. 19:19 we are told that "Moses spake," but we are not informed what he said. Centuries later, however, the Holy Spirit tells us that though Moses had been forty days in the presence of God, he was so impressed by the omnipotent power and indescribable glory manifested, when to quailing humanity the Lord spoke the principles of His own perfection, that he said, "I exceedingly fear and quake."

3. "So terrible were the tokens of Jehovah's presence that the hosts of Israel shook with fear, and fell upon their faces before the Lord. Even Moses exclaimed, 'I exceedingly fear and quake.'

"And now the thunders ceased; the trumpet was no longer heard; the earth was still. There was a period of solemn silence, and then the voice of God was heard. Speaking out of the thick darkness that enshrouded Him, as He stood upon the mount, surrounded by a retinue of angels, the Lord made known His law. Moses, describing the scene, says: 'The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; He shined forth from Mount Paran, and He came with ten thousands of saints; from His right hand went a fiery law for them. Yea, He loved the people; all His saints are in Thy hand; and they sat down at Thy feet; every one shall receive of Thy words,'" — "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 304, 305.

4. "It is inevitable that children should suffer from the consequences of parental wrong-doing, but they are not punished for the parents' guilt, except as they participate in their sins. It is usually the case, however, that children walk in the steps of their parents. By inheritance and example the sons become partakers of the father's sin. Wrong tendencies, perverted appetites, and debased morals, as well as physical disease and degeneracy, are transmitted as a legacy from father to son, to the third and fourth generation. This fearful truth should have a solemn power to restrain men from following a course of sin." — Id., page 306.

5. "By the thoughtless mention of God in common conversation, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the frequent and thoughtless repetition of His name, we dishonor Him." — Id., pages 306, 307.

6. "The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten in which are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver. It is the only one that shows by whose authority the law is given. Thus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His law as evidence of its authenticity and binding force." — Id., page 307.

7. "The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield respect, submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and comfort them in old age. It also enjoins respect for ministers and rulers, and for all others to whom God has delegated authority." — Id., page 308.

8. "An intention to deceive is what constitutes falsehood. By a glance of the eye, a motion of the hand, an expression of the countenance, a falsehood may be told as effectually as by words. All intentional overstatement, every hint or insinuation calculated to convey an erroneous or exaggerated impression, even the statement of facts in such a manner as to mislead, is falsehood." — Id., page 309.

9. "The tenth commandment strikes at the very root of all sins, prohibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the sinful act. He who in obedience to God's law refrains from indulging even a sinful desire for that which belongs to another, will not be guilty of an act of wrong toward his fellow creatures." — Id., page 309.
