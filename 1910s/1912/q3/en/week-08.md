## Notes

1. The word from which "Comforter" is translated is the Greek word Paraclete. Five times this word is used in the New Testament, four times by Jesus in the upper room discourse to the disciples (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7), where it refers to the person of the Holy Spirit, and once in 1 John 2:1, where it refers to Christ. In 1 John 2:1, we read: "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." The word Paraclete, translated "Comforter" in the other texts, is here translated "advocate," which is perhaps a little nearer the original text, and refers to a personal Saviour. The Holy Spirit is Christ's personal representative in the earth.

2. The word of God is the sword of the Spirit. Eph. 6:17. When in trial, the Spirit of God will bring to our minds the precious promises of God, to strengthen us, and defeat the enemy. But in order that the Spirit may do this we must fill our minds with the Word by diligent study. It was with the Word that Jesus met the enemy in the temptation in the wilderness. The Spirit and the Word go together. This has been well stated as follows:

"The means of the Holy Ghost to accomplish His work in us is the word of God. The church, looked at from one point of view, is a school. In this school, as in all others, there are two things, — the lesson book (the Bible), and the Teacher (the Holy Ghost, who makes us understand and learn the lessons). Or, to make use of another comparison, the Holy Ghost is the heavenly Workman, who wishes to perform a good work in us — that of our salvation; and the Bible is the instrument He has prepared to that end; the ministers whom He has established in the church are the monitors charged with explaining the lessons (Ephesians 4; 1 Corinthians 12). He wishes us to listen to them, inasmuch as they are themselves faithful learners of the Word He has given us. The Holy Ghost, whether He wishes to explain, console, or sanctify, does nothing without the Word; by it we have been born again (1 Peter 2:2, 3); by it we are nourished (1 Peter 2:2; compare John 17:17). The Word is called 'the sword of the Spirit' (Eph. 6:17).

"To take the one without the other is to take the Teacher without the Book, or the Workman without His tool. Unhappily, only too many do this, with evil consequences — some doctrinal and others simply practical."

"The Spirit and the Word, the Word and the Spirit, are two things indissolubly united by God. A theology which separates them is not worthy of the name. 'The Spirit without the Word' is, with some, personal inspiration with all its illusions, or mysticism in its bad sense, if not fanaticism with all its errors.

"On the other hand, 'the Word without the Spirit' is, for some, orthodox intellectualism with its desolating dryness, or, what is still worse, rationalism and its errors; for others it is a prolongation of their childish comprehension of the Word, the want of peace and confidence in the promise of God, of assurance and rejoicing over our reconciliation with Him through faith in Jesus Christ. And it is also a delay in sanctification. Let us avoid these two extremes with equal care; while we hold the Book, let us lift our hearts to Him who makes us able to read it with profit; in the union of the Word and the Spirit, and there alone, is there entire safety for our souls." — "Through the Eternal Spirit," pages 301, 302, 306.

3. If an enduement of the Holy Spirit was necessary in order that the disciples might do the work committed to their hands of carrying the gospel to the world, it is equally necessary for His people in the closing work of God in the earth.
