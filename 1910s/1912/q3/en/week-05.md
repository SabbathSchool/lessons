## Notes

1. Much that is called faith is a mere belief founded on the opinions and assumptions of men. The "devils also believe, and tremble" (James 2:19), but this is not faith. Real faith is founded upon the eternal rock of Scripture. To those who believe, the word of Jehovah is the end of all controversy.

2. "The ship that rides at anchor experiences rackings and heavings that ships which drift with the tide do not know. So souls who have no hold of Christ seem to lie softer on the surface of a heaving world than souls that are anchored in His power and love. The drifting ship, before she strikes, is more smooth and more comfortable than the anchored one; but when she strikes, the smoothness is all over. The pleasures of sin are sweet to those who taste them; but the sweetness is only for a season.

"When the anchor has been cast into a good ground, the heavier the strain that comes on it, the deeper and firmer grows its hold. As winds and currents increase in volume, the anchor bites more deeply into the soil, and so increases its preserving power. It is thus with a trusting soul; temptations, instead of driving him away from his Saviour, only fix his affections firmer on the Rock of Ages." — "The Sermon Bible," volume 11, page 319.

3. Faith is not speculation. It does not guess its way through. Faith knows. We understand by faith. It is folly to claim, as some do, that they will not believe that which they do not understand. Faith precedes understanding. All the infidel ideas advanced concerning the stupendous work of creation are set forth simply because what God says in His word concerning creation is not believed. Faith believes things beyond the power of human understanding.

4. Rotherham's translation of 1 John 5:4 reads, "And this is the conquest that conquers the world, even our faith." The Bible abounds with examples showing how unwavering faith in the words of Jehovah has brought victory to God's people in the past. And the Lord is the same to-day as in the past. Heb. 13:8.

5. Righteousness is the gift of God (Rom. 5:17), as is eternal life (Rom. 6:23), and the two are so inseparable that one involves the other. Both these gifts, as all others, are received by believing. During the time of probation, life is continued to the impenitent in order to give them the opportunity to repent; but after probation closes, the coming of the Lord will be attended by such a manifestation of glory as will destroy those who have not been living the life of faith in Christ. 2 Thess. 1:7-10. Those however who have become sons of God by believing (John 1:12), and have learned how to lay hold upon eternal life (1 Tim. 6:19), will not perish with the wicked in the day of Christ's appearing, but will continue to live by their faith.

6. "Poetry and eloquence for long centuries have delighted in proclaiming the glory of the brave Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans, whose heroic valor and death-defying patriotism made the pass of Thermopylae a shrine and an altar for Greece. Their equals in courage and patriotism, and their superiors in faith, were Gideon and the immortal three hundred who remained on mount Gilboa while their comrades bade them farewell and marched to their homes. It was no ordinary daring they displayed when, armed with pitchers and trumpets, they went forth to meet the multitudes of their foes. It was the boldness of faith in the divine word. 'One, with God on his side,' said the old German Reformers, 'is a majority.' Thus the three hundred outnumbered the hosts of Midian, for God was with them. It is grand to stand with God's minorities. Better be with them than the myriads of His enemies. Better be with them than with the large majority of cowardly, half-hearted Christians whom He can not use." — "Half Hours with the Lessons of 1883," page 840.

7. "The sleeping army was suddenly aroused. Upon every side was seen the light of the flaming torches. In every direction was heard the sound of trumpets, with the cry of the assailants. Believing themselves at the mercy of an overwhelming force, the Midianites were panic-stricken. With wild cries of alarm they fled for life, and mistaking their own companions for enemies, they slew one another. As news of the victory spread, thousands of the men of Israel who had been dismissed to their homes returned, and joined in pursuit of their fleeing enemies...

"In this signal defeat, not less than one hundred and twenty thousand of the invaders perished. The power of the Midianites was broken, so that they were never again able to make war upon Israel. The tidings spread swiftly far and wide, that Israel's God had again fought for His people. No words can describe the terror of the surrounding nations when they learned what simple means had prevailed against the power of a bold, warlike people." — "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 550, 553.

8. The gospel commission lasts until the end. The promises of these mighty workings of the Holy Spirit for those who believe are for us to-day as well as for the apostles. The fact that so little power is seen among God's people at the present time is sad evidence of the lack of real faith and trust in the promises of God.
