## Notes

1. Justification from sin is not merely the granting of pardon, or forgiveness. You may pardon a transgression, but not justify the offender. Justification from sin includes all this, and more. It is the accounting just, or righteous, before God of those who are unrighteous. It is a judicial act by which the innocence of the person is fully established. It is even more than this. "It is not only forgiveness for sins, but reclaiming from sin." It constitutes a change of standing before God, from a condition of guilt and condemnation to one of perfect and complete righteousness. It is a removal of all guilt, a justification from all sin and uncleanness. It includes complete remission of every sin, and an imputation of the righteousness of Jesus Christ to the penitent believer, so that we stand in the presence of the holy God free from all unrighteousness. This is an act of God alone. He and He alone is the one who justifies. Nothing that man can do can in any way justify a wrong committed. We are justified by faith, and not by works. The sinner believes, and God supplies the fact.

"In like manner you are a sinner. You can not atone for your past sins, you can not change your heart, and make yourself holy. But God promises to do all this for you through Christ. You believe that promise, you confess your sins, and give yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word to you. If you believe the promise, — believe that you are forgiven and cleansed, — God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It is so if you believe it." — "Steps to Christ," page 55.

2. "'And he believed in the Lord.' Neither Greek nor German, much less Latin or English, can furnish any full equivalent to the meaning of these words. He was supported, he was built up, he reposed as a child in its mother's arms (such seems the force of the Hebrew word), in the strength of God, in God, whom he did not see, more than in the giant empires of earth, and the bright lights of heaven, or the claims of tribe and kindred, which were always before him." — Stanley.

3. "True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before God only; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who have suffered injury through them; or they may be of a public character, and should then be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and to the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty...

"Confession will not be acceptable to God without sincere repentance and reformation. There must be decided changes in the life; everything offensive to God must be put away." — "Steps to Christ," pages 43, 44.
