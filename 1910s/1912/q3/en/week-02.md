## Notes

1. "The messenger whom God sent assured him that his prayer was accepted, and also his 'alms.' Do we sufficiently notice how the Bible connects almsgiving with prayer, and how little reason the Bible gives us to hope that God will hear our prayers if we do not hear the cry of the needy? This pious centurion's prayers were not hindered by stinginess. 'His prayers and his alms were had in remembrance in the sight of God.'" — "Half Hours with the Lessons of 1883," page 168.

2. No doubt as the Son of God prayed there was a pathos, an earnestness, a communing with His Father as with a friend, that deeply impressed the disciples. They longed to approach into the presence of God like that. They, therefore, requested that He teach them to pray. In response to their request, He repeated the same prayer which on a previous occasion, in the sermon on the mount, He had given to the multitude.

3. "In calling God our Father, we recognize all His children as our brethren. We are all a part of the great web of humanity, all members of one family. In our petitions, we are to include our neighbors as well as ourselves. No one prays aright who seeks a blessing for himself alone." — "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing."

4. The manna in the wilderness fell daily, and the people were to go out and gather a certain portion each day. This taught them the lesson of trusting the Lord each day for what they needed. So in the Lord's prayer we are to come to Him each day and ask Him to supply our needs. As He is our Father, we have the assurance that He will do this.

"He who lightened the cares and anxieties of His widowed mother, and helped her to provide for the household at Nazareth, sympathizes with every mother in her struggle to provide her children food. He who had compassion on the multitude because they 'fainted, and were scattered abroad,' still has compassion on the suffering poor. His hand is stretched out toward them in blessing; and in the very prayer which He gave His disciples He teaches us to remember the poor." — "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing."

5. "He who is unforgiving, cuts off every channel through which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not think that unless those who have injured us confess the wrong, we are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It is their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and confession; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward those who have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their faults. However sorely they may have wounded us, we are not to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with ourselves over our injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses against God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us." — Id.
