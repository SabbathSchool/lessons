## Notes

1. "It is a great thing to have a well that you can carry with you; to have a well that is within you; to have your source of satisfaction, not in the things outside yourself, but in a well within, and that is always within, and that is always springing up in freshness and power; to have our well of satisfaction and joy within us. We are then independent of our environment. It matters little whether we have health or sickness, prosperity or adversity, our source of joy is within and is ever springing up...

"This fountain within is always gushing up with greatest power and fulness in the days of deepest bereavement. At such a time all earthly satisfactions fail. What satisfaction is there in money, or worldly pleasure, in the theater or the opera or the dance, in fame or power of human learning, when some loved one is taken from us? But in the hours when those that we love dearest upon earth are taken from us, then it is that the spring of joy of the indwelling Spirit of God bursts forth with fullest flow, sorrow and sighing flee away, and our own spirits are filled with peace and ecstasy. We have beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness (Isa. 61:3)." — "The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit," pages 113, 114.

2. Three laws are here brought to view: (a) The law of God; (b) The law of sin and death in our nature; (c) The "law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." The attempt to keep God's holy law in our own strength results in total failure. We sink deeper and deeper into the terrible pit of sin. We are constantly dragged down by the law of sinful habits in our nature. But when we in our wretched, hopeless, helpless condition look up to Jesus, and surrender to Him every purpose, desire, and affection, the Holy Spirit takes control of the life, and sets us free from the power of indwelling sin, the law of sin and death in our members, and gives us continual victory over sin. It sets the despairing captive free. The desires of the flesh may at times assert themselves, for the flesh is still there, but we "through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body." This is indeed glorious fruit of the Holy Spirit.

3. "Christ's act in cursing the tree which His own power had created, stands as a warning to all churches and to all Christians. No one can live the law of God without ministering to others. But there are many who do not live out Christ's merciful, unselfish life. Some who think themselves excellent Christians do not understand what constitutes service for God. They plan and study to please themselves. They act only in reference to self. Time is of value to them only as they can gather for themselves. In all the affairs of life this is their object. Not for others but for themselves do they minister. God created them to live in a world where unselfish service must be performed. He designed them to help their fellow men in every possible way. But self is so large that they can not see anything else. They are not in touch with humanity. Those who thus live for self are like the fig-tree, which made every pretension, but was fruitless. They observe the forms of worship, but without repentance or faith. In profession they honor the law of God, but obedience is lacking. They say, but do not. In the sentence pronounced on the fig-tree Christ demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is this vain pretense. He declares that the open sinner is less guilty than is he who professes to serve God, but who bears no fruit to His glory." — "Desire of Ages," page 584.
