# A Thin "Desire of Ages"

A thin, convenient-to-handle edition of that truly wonderful book "Desire of Ages," has just come from the press. This edition is printed from the subscription book plates, on a special thin white paper, which makes a beautiful book. The full page engravings of the illustrated edition are, for the sake of lightness, eliminated, but it retains all the engraved chapter headings, the small illustrations found in the text, together with all the reading-matter, of the regular subscription book. The wide margins have been considerably reduced, so it weighs only 28 ounces.

Coming in response to a continued demand, which has increased as the book has become one of reference for all classes of workers and students, "Desire of Ages" in this form is heartily appreciated. It is but little larger than "The Acts of the Apostles," and uniform with it in styles of binding.

Cloth binding - $1.50  
Limp Russia - $2.00
