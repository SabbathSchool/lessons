## Introductory Note

The lessons for this quarter are a continuation of the topical studies begun the first quarter of the year. Although the subjects are familiar, our faith will be strengthened, and our hearts refreshed, as we study again God's word for the evidences of our faith. We should be ready at all times to give "a reason of the hope" that is in us. These lessons should be helpful in grounding our faith a little more firmly in the blessed truths of the third angel's message. That this may be realized, let diligent study be given each topic.
