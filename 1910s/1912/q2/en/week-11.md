## Notes

1. Here a powerful king commanded worship to an image he had set up. This command would require the breaking of God's holy law. These three loyal men respectfully yet firmly announced to the king that whether their God preserved their lives or not, they would not worship this image he had set up, nor bow down to it. Here principle was involved. It was impossible to obey the king, and at the same time remain true and loyal to the God of heaven whom they served. The issue was thus sharply drawn between obeying God, or the king's commandment — between the worship of the Creator, or the worship of a false god. These Hebrews chose to "obey God rather than men," and heaven set its seal upon their choice.

2. The three Hebrew brethren did not lose their individual accountability amid the throng of worshipers in the plain of Dura. No king could answer for them before that God whom they served. Rom. 14:12. Likewise in the experience of Daniel, Peter, and all the martyrs suffering affliction rather than to disobey God by obeying some earthly ruler acting out of the ordained sphere of civil government.

3. "The time is coming when God's people will feel the hand of persecution because they keep holy the seventh day. Satan has caused the change of the Sabbath in the hope of carrying out his purpose for the defeat of God's plans. He seeks to make the commands of God of less force in the world than human laws. The man of sin, who thought to change times and laws, and who has always oppressed the people of God, will cause laws to be made enforcing the observance of the first day of the week. But God's people are to stand firm for Him. And the Lord will work in their behalf showing plainly that He is the God of gods."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 229, 530.
