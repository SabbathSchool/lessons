# Lesson 10 — Temperance

*June 8, 1912*

**LESSON HELP:** Sabbath School Worker.

**GENERAL NOTE:** In the consideration of the topic of temperance as a Sabbath-school lesson, it is not the design to go into details as to what articles of food constitute a proper diet. Principles are presented for individual help. Much will be lost, therefore, by those who participate in discussion of what should constitute articles of diet. Quotations as notes have been taken from "Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," a book written by Mrs. E. G. White, and published in 1890, because it was thought that but few of our brethren and sisters possessed a copy of this excellent book. Those who do have it can use it much with profit as a help in the study of this lesson. In this book, page 57, are found these words: "There is real common sense in health reform. People can not all eat the same things. Some articles of food that are wholesome and palatable to one person, may be hurtful to another... So it is impossible to make an unvarying rule by which to regulate every one's dietetic habits."

## Notes

1. This is a most comprehensive text. To be temperate in all things includes more than reforms in a few articles of food. The American Revised Version instead of the word "temperate" has the word "self-control." The same rendering is given also in Acts 24:25; Gal. 5:23; 2 Peter 1:6; Titus 1:8. This expresses the true idea of temperance. It is to be self-restrained, continent in all things. True temperance includes the entire life. Some may be temperate or self-controlled in one or two particulars, yet very intemperate or self-gratifying in other directions. To be temperate in "all things," includes temperance in eating and drinking, in labor, both mental and physical, in recreation,— in fact in everything which goes to make up the life.

2. "Those who are advocating a reform in diet should, by the provision they make for their own table, present the advantages of hygiene in the best light. They should so exemplify its principles as to commend it to the judgment of candid minds.

"There is a large class who will reject any reform movement, however reasonable, if it lays a restriction upon the appetite. They consult taste, instead of reason and the laws of health. By this class, all who leave the beaten track of custom and advocate reform will be opposed, and accounted radical, let them pursue ever so consistent a course.

"But no one should permit opposition or ridicule to turn him from the work of reform, or cause him to lightly regard it. He who is imbued with the spirit which actuated Daniel, will not be narrow or conceited, but he will be firm and decided in standing for the right. In all his associations, whether with his brethren or with others, he will not swerve from principle, while at the same time he will not fail to manifest a noble, Christlike patience. When those who advocate hygienic reform carry the matter to extremes, people are not to blame if they become disgusted. Too often our religious faith is thus brought into disrepute, and in many cases those who witness such exhibitions of inconsistency can never afterward be brought to think that there is anything good in the reform. Those extremists do more harm in a few months than they can undo in a lifetime. They are engaged in a work which Satan loves to see go on.

"Two classes have been presented before me: first, those who are not living up to the light which God has given them; secondly, those who are too rigid in carrying out their one-sided ideas of reform, and enforcing them on others. When they take a position, they stand to it stubbornly, and carry nearly everything over the mark."—"Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," pages 55, 56.

3. "Surfeit.— To feed so as to oppress the stomach and derange the functions of the system; to overfeed, and produce satiety, sickness, or uneasiness; excess in eating and drinking."—Webster.

"Overeating, even of the most wholesome food, is to be guarded against. Nature can use no more than is required for building up the various organs of the body, and excess clogs the system." "Attention should be given also to the proper combination of foods. By brain-workers and others of sedentary pursuits, but few kinds should be taken at a meal."—"Education," page 205.

4. "Narrow ideas, an overstraining of small points, have been a great injury to the cause of hygiene. There may be such an effort at economy in the preparation of food, that, instead of a healthful diet, it becomes a poverty-stricken diet. What is the result? — Poverty of the blood. I have seen several cases of disease most difficult to cure, which were due to impoverished diet. The persons thus afflicted were not compelled by poverty to adopt a meager diet, but did so in order to follow out their own erroneous ideas of what constitutes health reform. Day after day, meal after meal, the same articles of food were prepared without variation, until dyspepsia and general debility resulted."—"Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," page 57.

5. Temperance, or self-control, is only one qualification of many that go to make up a perfect Christian character. All these qualifications here mentioned by Peter blend into one symmetrical whole. Knowledge precedes temperance. Good judgment and sound sense are needed in wisely taking hold of temperance principles. Then it becomes a powerful adjunct in rising to the higher attainments of patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love.

6. "God requires of His people continual advancement. We need to learn that indulged appetite is the greatest hindrance to mental improvement and soul sanctification. With all our profession of health reform, many of us eat improperly. Indulgence of appetite is the greatest cause of physical and mental debility, and lies largely at the foundation of feebleness and premature death. Let the individual who is seeking to possess purity of spirit bear in mind that in Christ there is power to control the appetite."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 156.
