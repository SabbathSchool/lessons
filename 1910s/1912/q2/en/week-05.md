## Notes

1. Angels are created beings. The Son of God being the One by whom the Father spoke all things into existence (John 1:1-3), it is evident that the Son Himself existed prior to the highest order of heavenly angels. Col. 1:15, 17. It is reasonable that angels, as well as man, should worship the Son who was associated with the Father in their creation. This they do, by the command of the Father. Heb. 1:6.

2. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His people, and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel. If the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger, the angels that ever attended them would fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and the angels in the city would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission another angel to descend to encourage, watch over, and try to keep them from going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed to the watchful care of these angels, and would not be comforted by them, but continued to go astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They would bear the tidings upward, and all the angels in the city would weep."—"Early Writings," old edition, part 1, page 31; new edition, page 39.

3. "Angels 'gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.' Little children are borne by holy angels to their mothers' arms. Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs of gladness ascend together to the city of God."—"Great Controversy," page 645.
