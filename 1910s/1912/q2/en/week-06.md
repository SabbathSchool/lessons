## Notes

1. Spiritualism.—"The belief that the spirits of the dead in various ways communicate with and manifest their presence to men, usually through the agency of a person called a medium." — Standard Dictionary.

"The deification of the dead has held a prominent place in nearly every system of heathenism, as has also the supposed communion with the dead. The gods were believed to communicate their will to men, and also, when consulted, to give them counsel. Of this character were the famous oracles of Greece and Rome.

"The belief in communion with the dead is still held, even in professedly Christian lands. Under the name of Spiritualism, the practise of communicating with beings claiming to be the spirits of the departed, has become wide-spread. It is calculated to take hold of the sympathies of those who have laid their loved ones in the grave. Spiritual beings sometimes appear to persons in the form of their deceased friends, and relate incidents connected with their lives, and perform acts which they performed while living. In this way they lead men to believe that their dead friends are angels, hovering over them, and communicating with them. Those who thus assume to be the spirits of the departed, are regarded with a certain idolatry, and with many their word has greater weight than the word of God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 684, 685.

2. Having been created perfect in wisdom and beauty, when the evil thought entered Lucifer's heart to be like God (Isa. 14:12-14), to be worshiped, his great wisdom was perverted to work ruin. This is further proved by his being able to deceive a host of the angels in heaven itself into the belief that his cause was just and right.

"Leaving his place in the immediate presence of God, Lucifer went forth to diffuse the spirit of discontent among the angels... Since their natures were holy, he urged that the angels should obey the dictates of their own will. He sought to create sympathy for himself, by representing that God had dealt unjustly with him in bestowing supreme honor upon Christ. He claimed that in aspiring to greater power and honor he was not aiming at self-exaltation, but was seeking to secure liberty for all the inhabitants of heaven, that by this means they might attain to a higher state of existence."—"Great Controversy," page 495.

The angels were deceived upon the point of supposing that Lucifer aimed to attain for them a "higher state of existence." And it was upon this same point Eve was lured into disobedience and sin. "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil," was Satan's word to her in Eden. And thousands through modern Spiritualism are deceived into believing the highest law they are to know is the desire of their own hearts,— Christ, God's laws, and the Bible being set aside as standing in the way of man's highest development.

3. "Satan has power to bring before us the appearance of forms purporting to be our relatives or friends who sleep in Jesus. It will be made to appear as if these friends were actually present; the words they uttered while here, with which we were familiar, will be spoken, and the same tone of voice that they had while living, will fall upon the ear... The people of God must be prepared to withstand these spirits with the Bible truth that the dead know not anything, and that they who thus appear are the spirits of devils."—"Early Writings," old edition, part 3, page 124; new edition, page 262.

4. Not always do the greatest deceptions come by way of opposition, but frequently by assumed sympathy. Clothed in angel robes, with subdued tones and apparent interest for the tempted and tried one, the tempter approaches with his allurements. Thus he approached Jesus in the wilderness. Souls are thus thrown off their guard, and Satan can the more surely fasten them in his deception.

5. "Satan and his angels suffered long. Satan bore not only the weight and punishment of his own sins, but also of the sins of the redeemed host, which had been placed upon him; and he must also suffer for the ruin of souls which he had caused." "Said the angel, 'Satan is the root, his children are the branches. They are now consumed root and branch. They have died an everlasting death. They are never to have a resurrection, and God will have a clean universe.'"—"Early Writings," old edition, part 3, page 154; new edition, pages 294, 295.
