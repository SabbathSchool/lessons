## Notes

1. If they had been created immortal, it is certain the Lord would not have said, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

2. It should be observed that God is now addressing the same man, or "living soul," mentioned in Gen. 2:7. He says of him, "For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."

3. The original word here rendered "immortal" occurs in six other instances in the New Testament, each time being rendered "incorruptible," or its equivalent. Greenfield's Greek Lexicon defines this word: "Incorruptible, immortal, imperishable, undying, enduring." The word is found in the following texts: 1 Tim. 1:17; Rom. 1:23; 1 Cor. 9:25; 15:52; 1 Peter 1:4, 23; 3:4.

4. The hope that man by some merit of his own, through an inherent principle of life, will in some manner reach the immortal state, and live forever, is shattered by these words of the Son of God: "Ye shall... die in your sins." This is the exact opposite of that original falsehood Satan told in Eden, and has since restated in a thousand false religions, "Ye shall not surely die." Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism, Theosophy, Christian Science, and Spiritualism all have for their tap-root the dogma of human immortality. Were it not for this fetish of human immortality, not one of these baneful and false religions would ever have been possible.
