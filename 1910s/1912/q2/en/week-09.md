## Notes

1. "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exemplification of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things, He is constantly ministering for others. 'He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.' This ideal of ministry God has committed to His Son. Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, that by His example He might teach what it means to minister. His whole life was under a law of service. He served all, ministered to all. Thus He lived the law of God, and by His example showed how we are to obey it."—"Desire of Ages," page 649.

2. While unselfish ministry originated with God, self-seeking and self-exaltation originated with Satan. Unconsciously, the disciples had imbibed this worldly spirit; they strove among themselves which should be accounted the greatest.

"Many of their contentions for supremacy, much of their dissatisfaction with Christ's methods, originated with Judas." "That which ruled him was the hope of selfish benefit in the worldly kingdom which he expected Christ to establish."—Mrs. E. G. White, in "Education," pages 91, 92.

3. It was more than the ordinance of feet-washing Jesus was giving the church. By this memorial He bequeathed His own spirit of loving ministry to His followers. This was His answer for all time as to who should be the greatest.

"For these disciples [Judas excepted] the mission of Christ finally accomplished its purpose. Little by little His example and His lessons of self-abnegation molded their characters. His death destroyed their hope of worldly greatness. The fall of Peter, the apostasy of Judas, their own failure in forsaking Christ in His anguish and peril, swept away their self-sufficiency. They saw their own weakness; they saw something of the greatness of the work committed to them; they felt their need of their Master's guidance at every step."— Id., pages 93, 94.

4. "At the first feast He attended with His disciples [John 2:1-11], Jesus gave them the cup that symbolized His work for their salvation. At the last supper He gave it again, in the institution of that sacred rite by which His death was to be shown forth 'till He come.'"

"The communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples." "The wine which Christ provided for the feast [at Cana], and that which He gave to the disciples as a symbol of His own blood, was the pure juice of the grape."—"Desire of Ages," pages 149, 659.

The bread used in instituting the Lord's supper was Passover bread. Of this feast God commanded, "Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters." Ex. 13:7. Leaven, or fermentation, represents sin. See 1 Cor. 5:7, 8.

5. "So that whosoever may be eating the loaf or drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord."— Rotherham's Translation.

If one by faith discerns by these emblems his Lord dying on Calvary to atone for his sins, having confessed them, he is not eating and drinking "unworthily," or in an unbecoming or irreverent manner.

"Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully comprehend the magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by the Majesty of heaven. The plan of salvation is glorified before us, and the thought of Calvary awakens living and sacred emotions in our hearts. Praise to God and the Lamb will be in our hearts and on our lips; for pride and self-worship can not flourish in the soul that keeps fresh in memory the scenes of Calvary."—"Desire of Ages," page 661.

6. Jesus longs to have His people with Him. John 17:24. Spanning the interval between this last supper with the disciples until that time when all the hosts of the redeemed are gathered about His table in heaven, Jesus covenants not to partake of the fruit of the vine. To Him, also, it would seem the emblem is very sacred, in that through it a most solemn covenant relation is sustained between the redeemed and their Redeemer. Precious Saviour! Upon His heart constantly He bears His tempted, struggling children.
