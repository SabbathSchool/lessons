## Notes

1. "Among the multitudes that had gathered about him at the Jordan, John had heard dark tales of crime, and had met souls bowed down with the burden of myriad sins; but never had he come in contact with a human being from whom there breathed an influence so divine. All this was in harmony with what had been revealed to John regarding the Messiah. Yet he shrank from granting the request of Jesus. How could he, a sinner, baptize the Sinless One? And why should He who needed no repentance submit to a rite that was a confession of guilt to be washed away?

"As Jesus asked for baptism, John drew back, exclaiming, 'I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?' With firm yet gentle authority, Jesus answered, 'Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.' And John, yielding, led the Saviour down into the Jordan, and buried Him beneath the water."—"Desire of Ages," pages 110, 111.

2. Genuine faith in Christ as the Saviour from sin precedes baptism. Baptism follows as an outward expression of the faith already in the heart.

3. When death overtakes an individual, burial follows. It would be a very sad thing to be buried alive. Likewise when the old man, the world's affections and lusts, is crucified, then burial into the watery grave with Jesus should take place. Ananias said to Paul, who for three days had fasted and prayed and confessed his sins to God, "Why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized." It was time now for him to be buried; for he had renounced his past sinful life. When we have turned away from sin and the old man is dead, we should then be buried in the watery grave. It is a sad thing for the church, and the individual as well, to bury the "old man" alive.

4. Jesus did not leave two memorials for one event. If, therefore, baptism commemorates His resurrection, it is evident that there is no need for the setting apart of the first day of the week to commemorate His resurrection, the day upon which He rose from the grave.

5. The Bible presents one baptism. Paul says, "We are buried with Him by baptism into death." Rom. 6:4. When anything is buried it is covered up, put out of sight. The dead are buried beneath the ground, covered up and so hidden from view. Likewise to follow Jesus into death, into the grave by baptism, the candidate must be buried beneath the water, hidden from view, or there can be no significance whatever to the ordinance.

6. "Those who have put on Christ by baptism, by this act showing their separation from the world, and that they have covenanted to walk in newness of life, should not set up idols in their hearts. Those who have once rejoiced in the evidence of sins forgiven, who have tasted a Saviour's love, and who then persist in uniting with the foes of Christ, rejecting the perfect righteousness that Jesus offers them, and choosing the ways that He has condemned, will be more severely judged than the heathen who have never had the light, and have never known God or His law. Those who refuse to follow the light which God has given them, choosing the amusements, vanities, and follies of the world, and refusing to conform their conduct to the just and holy requirements of God's law, are guilty of the most aggravating sins in the sight of God."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 3, pages 365, 366.

7. "Do you ask, 'How am I to abide in Christ?'— In the same way as you received Him at first. 'As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him.' 'The just shall live by faith.' You gave yourself to God, to be His wholly, to serve and obey Him, and you took Christ as your Saviour. You could not yourself atone for your sins or change your heart; but having given yourself to God, you believed that He, for Christ's sake, did all this for you. By faith you became Christ's, and by faith you are to grow up in Him,— by giving and taking. You are to give all,— your heart, your will, your service,— give yourself to Him to obey all His requirements; and you must take all,— Christ, the fulness of all blessing, to abide in your heart, to be your strength, your righteousness, your everlasting helper,— to give you power to obey."—"Steps to Christ," chapter "Growing Up into Christ."
