## Notes

1. All the dead would remain in their graves forever were it not that Christ died and rose again. For if He be not risen, then there can be no resurrection of the dead. But the blessed truth that there shall be a resurrection, because Jesus actually died and rose again (Rev. 1:18), brings life within reach of every lost son and daughter of Adam, and makes the plan of eternal life through Him forever sure. John 14:19; Acts 2:24.

2. "Amid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then raising His hands to heaven He cries, 'Awake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust, and arise!' Throughout the length and breadth of the earth, the dead shall hear that voice; and they that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with the tread of the exceeding great army of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. From the prison-house of death they come, clothed with immortal glory, crying, 'O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?'"—"Great Controversy," page 644.

3. "All come forth from their graves the same in stature as when they entered the tomb. Adam, who stands among the risen throng, is of lofty height and majestic form, in stature but little below the Son of God. He presents a marked contrast to the people of later generations; in this one respect is shown the great degeneracy of the race. But all arise with the freshness and vigor of eternal youth... All blemishes and deformities are left in the grave. Restored to the tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the redeemed will 'grow up' to the full stature of the race in its primeval glory."— Id., pages 644, 645.

4. "Then Jesus and all the retinue of holy angels, and all the redeemed saints, left the city. The angels surrounded their Commander, and escorted Him on His way, and the train of redeemed saints followed. Then, in terrible, fearful majesty, Jesus called forth the wicked dead; and they came up with the same feeble, sickly bodies that went into the grave. What a spectacle! What a scene! At the first resurrection all came forth in immortal bloom; but at the second the marks of the curse are visible on all."

"As they come forth from their graves, they resume the current of their thoughts where it ceased in death." "Then I saw that Satan again commenced his work. He passed around among his subjects and made the weak and feeble strong, and told them that he and his angels were powerful. He pointed to the countless millions who had been raised." "Then he looks over the vast army, and tells them that the company in the city is small and feeble, and that they can go up and take it, and cast out its inhabitants, and possess its riches and glory themselves. Satan succeeds in deceiving them, and all immediately begin to prepare themselves for battle."—"Early Writings," old edition, part 3, pages 151-153; new edition, pages 292, 293.

5. What a glorious triumph it will be when death shall forever be destroyed! Satan and his host of evil angels also perish in the same lake of fire. Matt. 25:41. This is the second death, from which there is no resurrection. It is from this that the saved have been redeemed by the death of the precious Son of God. Then begins the glorious reign of the saints with Christ, in the newly-created earth, untainted by the curse of sin, the home of the redeemed throughout eternity. Glorious inheritance!
