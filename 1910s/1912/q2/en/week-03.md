## Notes

1. That the judgment was still future in Paul's time is evident in that when he stood before Felix he reasoned of "righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come." Acts 24:25. But notwithstanding this appointed "day," or time, for judgment, then future, Paul so spoke of its solemn scenes as to cause the wicked, time-serving Roman governor before whom he spoke, to tremble. This being true, how we should sense the importance of the time in which we now live,— it being that very time, or "day," to which Paul alluded.

2. It will be noticed that when the time comes for this message to go to the world proclaiming the judgment, the announcement is, "The hour of His judgment is come." This investigative judgment is the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, which was typified by the day of atonement in the yearly round of the earthly sanctuary. This "hour" of God's judgment, by a very sure line of prophecy, is shown to have begun in 1844. At this time Christ passed from the holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary into the most holy, and "the judgment was set, and the books were opened." See Dan. 9:24-27. Thus the time for the judgment to begin is made clear. For nearly threescore years and ten this solemn review of men's lives has been going on by the Judge of all the earth, who, the psalmist declares, "shall judge the world in righteousness." Ps. 9:7, 8.

3. The "book of life" doubtless contains the names of those who by faith have laid hold of eternal life. But it is possible for a name once entered to be blotted out. Ex. 32:33. It is the most desirable of all things that our names be written and retained in this book. Luke 10:20; Rev. 3:5.

4. Before their destruction the scenes in Christ's life and death will be vividly portrayed before the wicked.

"The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God, on the charge of high treason against the government of heaven. They have none to plead their cause; they are without excuse; and the sentence of eternal death is pronounced against them.

"It is now evident to all that the wages of sin is not noble independence and eternal life, but slavery, ruin, and death. The wicked see what they have forfeited by their life of rebellion. The far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory was despised when offered them; but how desirable it now appears. 'All this,' cries the lost soul, 'I might have had; but I chose to put these things far from me. O, strange infatuation! I have exchanged peace, happiness, and honor, for wretchedness, infamy, and despair.' All see that their exclusion from heaven is just. By their lives they have declared, 'We will not have this Jesus to reign over us.'"—"Great Controversy," page 668.

5. The work of judgment which began in 1844, must continue until the cases of all are decided, both of the living and the dead; hence it will extend to the close of human probation. That men may be prepared to stand in the judgment, the message commands them to "fear God, and give glory to Him," and "worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." The result of an acceptance of these messages is given in the words, "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." In order to be prepared for the judgment, it is necessary that men should keep the law of God. That law will be the standard of character in the judgment. — Id., page 436.
