# The Prophetic Gift in the Gospel Church
By J. N. Loughborough

In preparing this pamphlet of 104 pages the writer has briefly traced the history of this "gift of prophecy," and shows clearly that manifestations of the gift should be seen in the gospel church of to-day.

He then gives a remarkable account of the exercise of the Prophetic Gift, as witnessed personally by himself and others during the past sixty years.

This important and interesting document may be had only as No. 164 of Bible Students' Library.

# Work with the Holiday Books

The new prospectus, with which hundreds of home workers successfully sold our truth-laden small books, adapted for holiday time, last year, has entirely revolutionized the small book work. Now, instead of carrying full books as samples, you have conveniently arranged in a neat, durable binder, sample covers and sheets from as many of the books of the entire list as you wish to sell. These samples are slipped on rings, and may be arranged in any order you desire. Scores of persons, including many children and young people, inexperienced in canvassing, have made this work a success. The following report from one of these shows what may be done:

The largest number of orders I have taken in one day (in five hours), amounted to $5.85 â€” ten orders. One morning from 9 to 11:30 I took eight orders, amounting to $3.75. I have never spent a whole day and many days I could not get out at all. I feel that the Lord has blessed me in this work:
- 2 Glorious Appearing, cloth          $1.00
- 7 Glorious Appearing, board           1.75
- 1 Gospel Primer, cloth                 .60

# Encouraging Tract Circulation

## The Five Dollar Package. Selection for Church Use.
By Express $6.15

## The Dollar Package. For the Individual or Family.
$1.25 post-paid

Activity in the use of tracts this year exceeds all past records. An enthusiasm in the churches, and at the camp-meetings, has kept large supplies of tracts going out from the publishers. Almost every freight shipment to branch offices and tract societies has carried tracts. One single order recently called for 50 Five Dollar Packages and 150 Dollar Packages (5 large cases). One camp-meeting used 50 Five Dollar Packages, and 100 Dollar Packages. Between January 1 and August 1, 319 Five Dollar Packages and 754 Dollar Packages have been ordered from one publishing house, and large quantities have been supplied in other forms.

Never have there been more apparent results of gospel "seed-sowing." The Lord is leading in this increased missionary activity. Are you personally having a part in it? You may have. Ask your tract society for "Like the Leaves of Autumn," which gives full lists of tracts and best methods of use.
