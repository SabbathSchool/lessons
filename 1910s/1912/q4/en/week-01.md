## Notes

1. We are reconciled to God by the death of Christ, but saved by His life. In His life on earth is seen the perfect righteousness which the law demands. By nature we are wholly unrighteous. In our flesh is found no good thing. But through faith we are cleansed from sin, and the righteous life of Jesus is imputed to us. This righteousness is in harmony with the claims of the law, and enables us to stand acquitted in the judgment.

2. "By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us."—"Desire of Ages," page 25.

3. "For four thousand years the race had been decreasing in physical strength, in mental powers, and in moral worth; and Christ took upon Him the infirmities of degenerate humanity. Only thus could He rescue man from the lowest depths of his degradation. Many claim that it was impossible for Christ to be overcome by temptation. Then He could not have been placed in Adam's position; He could not have gained the victory that Adam failed to gain. If we have in any sense a more trying conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor us. But our Saviour took humanity, with all its liabilities. He took the nature of man, with the possibility of yielding to temptation. We have nothing to bear which He has not endured."—Id., page 117.
