## Notes

1. At the time of this command to offer up his son as a sacrifice, Isaac was about twenty and Abraham one hundred twenty years old.

2. "Heavenly beings were witnesses of the scene as the faith of Abraham and the submission of Isaac were tested. The trial was far more severe than that which had been brought upon Adam. Compliance with the prohibition laid upon our first parents involved no suffering; but the command to Abraham demanded the most agonizing sacrifice. All heaven beheld with wonder and admiration Abraham's unfaltering obedience. All heaven applauded his fidelity. Satan's accusations were shown to be false. God declared to His servant, 'Now I know that thou fearest God [notwithstanding Satan's charges], seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' God's covenant, confirmed to Abraham by an oath before the intelligences of other worlds, testified that obedience will be rewarded."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 155.

3. "It had been difficult even for the angels to grasp the mystery of redemption,— to comprehend that the Commander of heaven, the Son of God, must die for guilty man. When the command was given to Abraham to offer up his son, the interest of all heavenly beings was enlisted. With intense earnestness they watched each step in the fulfilment of this command. When to Isaac's question, 'Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?' Abraham made answer, 'God will provide Himself a lamb;' and when the father's hand was stayed as he was about to slay his son, and the ram which God had provided was offered in the place of Isaac,— then light was shed upon the mystery of redemption, and even the angels understood more clearly the wonderful provision that God had made for man's salvation."— Ib.
