## Notes

1. Love of the brethren is one of the tests of discipleship. If we really love, not some, but all the brethren, we are assured that our name is written in the book of life. "He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"

2. "Jesus teaches that we can receive forgiveness from God only as we forgive others. It is the love of God that draws us unto Him, and that love can not touch our hearts without creating love for our brethren. To cherish an unmerciful spirit toward others, is to close the heart against the mercy of God toward ourselves."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," page 151, old edition.

"O, the grave! the grave! It buries every error — covers every defect — extinguishes every resentment. From its peaceful bosom spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave even of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb, that he should ever have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies moldering before him?"—

3. Being "unequally yoked together" has a very broad application. No doubt it applies to worldly organizations, where Christians are bound by the rules of a selfish, unsanctified body. From these it calls for a separation. It covers also the marriage relation between believers and unbelievers. "The marriage of Christians with the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible. The Lord's direction is, 'Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 175.

"Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sentiment and watch every development of character in the one with whom they think to unite their life destiny. Let every step toward a marriage alliance be characterized by modesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to please and honor God. Marriage affects the after-life, both in this world and in the world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that God can not approve."—"Ministry of Healing," page 359.

4. "I saw that none could share the 'refreshing' unless they obtain the victory over every besetment, over pride, selfishness, love for the world, and over every wrong word and action. We should, therefore, be drawing nearer and nearer to the Lord, and be earnestly seeking that preparation necessary to enable us to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord. Let all remember that God is holy, and that none but holy beings can ever dwell in His presence."—"Early Writings," page 61, old edition; page 71, new edition.
