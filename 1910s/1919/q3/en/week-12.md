## Notes

1. The introduction of this parable with "For" indicates a continuation of the Saviour's theme as to how it will be at His coming. The parable of the ten virgins shows the dan-ger of being thoughtless or careless, during the tarrying time, about making a complete preparation for the Bridegroom's coming. The only means of safety is to watch. Now this parable of the ten talents shows how to use the time till the Lord's return. The best way to watch is to engage actively in work for the Lord.

2. "The talents are not apportioned capriciously. He who has ability to use five talents receives five. He who can im-prove but two, receives two. He who can wisely use only one, receives one. None need lament that they have not re-ceived larger gifts; for He who has apportioned to every man, is equally honored by the improvement of each trust, whether it be great or small."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page

3. "He was as faithful and as successful as the one who received five talents. All depends upon the ratio of faith-fulness. Even he who had received but one talent could have surpassed in a short time one who used five with less faith-fulness. What an inspiration to use to the best of our ability all that God has intrusted to us!"—Peloubet.

4. The Lord is represented here as giving his goods to each servant according to his ability. No more is required of any man than the faithful, energetic use of his God-given ability, whatever that ability may be. Ability and talents grow by use. It is not the Lord's plan that we merely pre-serve from waste the ability He gives us, if that were pos-sible, without using it, but He expects an increase.

6. "It was the one with the smallest gift who left his talent unimproved. In this is given a warning to all who feel that the smallness of their endowments excuses them from service for Christ. If they could do some great thing, • how gladly would they undertake it; but because they can serve only in little things, they think themselves justified in doing nothing. In this they err. The Lord in His distribu-tion of gifts is testing character. The man who neglected to improve his talent proved himself an unfaithful servant. Had he received five talents, he would have buried them as he buried the one. His misuse of the one talent showed that he despised the gifts of heaven."—Id., page
