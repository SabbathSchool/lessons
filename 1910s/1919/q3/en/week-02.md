## Notes

3. Bear in mind, through this interpretation, that the seed represents the "word of the kingdom," and the soil the heart of the hearer. The various conditions of the soil indi-cate conditions of the heart. The fruitage itself represents elements of character, and deeds of love in the life. This is not only true of the individual who receives the word, but also of every other one to whom he may minister that word. In the missionary sense, the hundredfold, the sixtyfold, and the thirtyfold may represent the souls brought to a saving knowledge of the gospel by various workers.

7. The word "offended" here, as usually elsewhere in the Gospels, means caused to stumble, or, more literally still, en-trapped, ensnared.

9. " 'The cares of this world.' No class is free from the temptation to worldly care. To the poor, toil and depriva-tion and the fear of want bring perplexities and burdens. To the rich come fear of loss and a multitude of anxious cares. Many of Christ's followers forget the lesson He has bidden us learn from the flowers of the field. They do not trust to His constant care. Christ cannot carry their burden, because they do not cast it upon Him. Therefore the cares of life, which should drive them to the Saviour for help and comfort, separate them from Him."—Id., page

10. "The wayside, the stony-ground, - the thorny-ground hearers need not remain such. The Spirit of God is ever seeking to break the spell of infatuation that holds men ab-sorbed in worldly things, and to awaken a desire for the im-perishable treasure. It is by resisting the Spirit that men become inattentive to or neglectful of God's word. They are themselves responsible for the hardness of heart that pre-vents the good seed from taking root, and for the evil growths that check its development."—Id., page

11. "Throughout the parable of the sower, Christ repre-sents the different results of the sowing as depending upon the soil. In every case the sower and the seed are the same. Thus He teaches that if the word of God fails of accom-plishing its work in our hearts and lives, the reason to be found in ourselves."—/b.
