## Notes

1. The "tares" here mentioned are a kind of darnel, a poisonous weed. During growth, it is very similar in appear-ance to wheat; but when it heads out, the grains are black, and easy to distinguish from wheat.

3. For "declare," the Revised Version has "explain." The meaning of the parable was not clear to the disciples, espe-cially the feature of the tares. As they frequently did, so here they asked Him for an explanation in private.

7. "But amid the tempest of divine judgment, the chil-dren of God will have no cause for fear. 'The Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.' The day that brings terror and destruction to the transgressors of God's law, will bring to the obedient, 'joy unspeakable, and full of glory.' Gather My saints together unto Me,' saith the Lord, 'those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge Himself.'
