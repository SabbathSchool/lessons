## Notes

1. "There is probably no Oriental town to be found that does not have its chronic and long continued cases of family litigation over questions concerning the division of property by inheritance. The judicial customs of Eastern tribunals are such as to encourage litigation, and leave cases open for repeated appeals.... Every one who comes into the neigh-borhood having a reputation as a learned man, or one above the ordinary level of intelligence, is compelled to hear the story, look through the documents, and express some opinion on the merits of the case."â€”Tarbell.
