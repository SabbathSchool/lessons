## Notes

1. "Then" refers to the time described in the previous verses. There is a very evident relation between this parable and the theme of the preceding chapter, which deals with the coming of the Lord. Two notes sound forth clearly through-out the parable and its application: Watch and get ready. Watching—that is, keeping wide-awake—is the main essen-tial to being ready. This represents a class of people who are looking for the coming Bridegroom, and waiting to go out to meet Him. Note that all the waiting ones are virgins —pure in faith. The parable is therefore for the church, not for the hypocrites or the heathen. In your study, watch for the one cause of the failure of half the waiting ones.

2. The marriage customs of the East are thus described: " 'When the wedding day arrived the bride put on white robes, often richly embroidered, decked herself with jewels, fas-tened the indispensable bridal girdle about her waist, covered herself with a veil, and placed a garland on her head. The bridegroom, arrayed in his best attire, set out from his home for the house of the bride's parents, attended by friends, ac-companied by musicians and singers, and, if the procession moved at night, by persons bearing torches. Having re-ceived the bride from her parents, he conducted the whole party back to his own or his father's house with song, music, and dancing. On the way back they were joined by the maiden friends of the bride and groom.'—Dr. Davis. 'When the bridegroom's house was reached, the procession entered, including the invited guests; the door was then closed, and no one arriving subsequently was permitted to enter.'— Abbott. Then followed the marriage ceremony and the wed-ding feast."

3. The peril of sleeping on the eve of the great and solemn event is evident from the outcome. If the foolish had taken the time of the delay to go and replenish'their oil, instead of spending this time in sleep, they would have gone in to the marriage with the wise.

5. The reply to the wise "is not selfish, even in the figure, for there was 'not enough for us and you.' To have divided the oil would have entirely defeated the purpose of the pro-cession. This belonged to the form of the parable. In real life the fact is the same, but for different reasons. However sorry the wise are for the foolish, it is impossible to supply their needs by a transference of qualities and character."
