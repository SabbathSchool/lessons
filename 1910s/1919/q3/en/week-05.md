## Notes

10. "—"Sin, ith's Bible Dictionary."

2. "Among the Jews the question, 'Who is my neighbor?' caused endless dispute. They had no doubt as to the heathen and the Samaritans. These were strangers and enemies. But where should the distinction be made among the people of their own nation, and among the different classes of so-ciety? Whom should the priest, the rabbi, the elder, regard as neighbor? They spent their lives in a round of cere-monies to make themselves pure. Contact with the ignorant and careless multitude, they taught, would cause defilement that would require wearisome effort to remove. Were they to regard the 'unclean' as neighbors?"—"Christ's Object Les-sons," page

3. "Again Christ refused to be drawn into controversy. He answered the question by relating an incident, the memory of which was fresh in the minds of His hearers."—Id., page

4. "God in His providence had brought the priest and the Levite along the road where the wounded sufferer lay, that they might see his need of mercy and help. All heaven watched to see if the hearts of these men would be touched with pity for human woe.... Trained in the school of national bigotry, they had become selfish, narrow, and ex-clusive. When they looked upon the wounded man, they could not tell whether he was of their nation or not. They thought he might be of the Samaritans, and they turned away."—"Desire of Ages," page
