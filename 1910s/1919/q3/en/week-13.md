## Notes

2. "As a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats." The following is a description of such a scene, condensed from "The Shepherd of Jebel Nur": "The shepherd's outcry and a quick commotion we heard —there was a sudden affray of the droll creatures. The fierce whack of charging heads, the bleating of terror-stricken sheep, the mingled shouts and soft calls of the hurrying shepherd as he strove to part them and to quell the wrath of one and the consternation of the other—it was all serious enough, that lonely little tumult on the sky-bound height. " 'What is the matter with them?' we asked. "Ah—they are just goats, just goats! Now you can fancy what was in the Master's mind when He said He would part folk, a day coming, 'as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats.' Think of His watching a scene like that and saying in His heart, 'There, 'twill be even so!' Tis a pass-ing fine way, you see, of picturing what no man of us can explain, try as we will. You will ofttimes be minded of that sight, I warrant—those black, butting creatures parted from the white and gentle sheep. Ah, they are a heady, quarrel-some stock, these goats! Climbing everywhere, devouring anything—why, sirs, pity them as we may, they are like selfishness on legs! All day the shepherd must ward his sheep from them as well as he can; and when folding time comes, he must make sure of shutting them off for the com-mon weal."

5. "Even among the heathen are those who have cher-ished the spirit of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their ears, they have befriended the missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own lives. Among the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is never brought by human instru-mentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to them in nature, and have done the things that the law re-quired. Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recognized as the children of God."—"The Desire of Ages," page

3. The punishment thus inflicted will be everlasting in effect—there will be no recovery from this destruction. Life can be everlasting in effect, only by never being cut off. In short, there are only two results—everlasting death and ever-lasting life. The means and progress of producing death need not be confused with the result—death.
