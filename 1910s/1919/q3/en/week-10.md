## Notes

1. Guests were invited some time before the wedding took place, then summoned, according to an Oriental custom, when everything was ready for the ceremony. So here the serv-ants went out to call those who had been bidden. The lan-guage in our text, "They would not come," seems a little strong, considering the force our idiom gives to "would." A more exact translation of the expression "would not" is, "did not desire" or "were not disposed" to come.

2. The first invitation to the marriage supper is repre-sented by the work for the Jews by Jesus and His apostles. The symbol of the second invitation is met by the fact that after the work of Christ on earth was completed, still another earnest effort was made for the Jewish people; but as a nation, they spurned the gospel message, and persecuted the messengers.

3. This may refer primarily to the terrible retribution which came upon Jerusalem and the Jewish people in A. D.
