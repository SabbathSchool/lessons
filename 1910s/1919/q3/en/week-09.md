## Notes

1. "In the parable the householder represented God, the vineyard the Jewish nation, and the hedge the divine law which was their protection. The tower was a symbol of the temple."—"Desire of Ages," page

4. "In the beloved son whom the lord of the vineyard finally sent to his disobedient servants, and whom they seized and slew, the priests and rulers saw a distinct picture of Jesus and His impending fate. Already they were planning to slay Him whom the Father had sent to them as a last appeal. In the retribution inflicted upon the ungrateful hus-bandmen was portrayed the doom of those who should put Christ to death."—"Desire of Ages," page

6. "The sin of the world to-day is the sin that brought destruction upon Israel. Ingratitude to God, the neglect of opportunities and blessings, the selfish appropriation of God's gifts,—these were comprised in the sin that brought wrath upon Israel. They are bringing ruin upon the world to-day." —"Christ's Object Lessons," page
