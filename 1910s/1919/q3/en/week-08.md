## Notes

2. The Roman denarius, here translated "penny," was equivalent to about seventeen cents. In the parable, this definite wage was agreed upon as satisfactory to both the householder and the laborers first hired. The other laborers, hired at various times through the day, were promised "what-soever is right." At settlement, these laborers received a "penny" as their pay, and were satisfied that the promise of their employer had been fully kept.

3. The Jews divided the time between sunrise and sunset into twelve parts; the third hour was about nine o'clock in the morning; the sixth and the ninth hour, noon and three in the afternoon, respectively; the eleventh hour, five in the evening.

4. It is necessary, to the purpose of the parable, that set-tlement for the day's labor should begin with the last em-ployed. If the laborers had received their pay in the order in which they were hired, the first might have received their "penny" and gone on their way satisfied. But settling with the last first, gave opportunity for envy to display itself, and for the lesson to be taught that in the kingdom of heaven reward is not earned, but bestowed out of grace and love in the Giver.

398. "Lord of the vineyard, whose dear word declares Our one hour's labor as the day's shall be, What coin divine can make our wage as theirs Who had the morning joy of work for Thee!"
