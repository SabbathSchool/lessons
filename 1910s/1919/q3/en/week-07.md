## Notes

17. "The latter then de-sired that his father, anticipating the division, should give him the equivalent of his portion in money, an arrangement in virtue of which the entire domain, on the father's death, would come to the elder."—Godet. "THE SPIRITUAL MEANING OF THE REQUEST.—It is the ex-pression of man's desire to be independent of God's control and restraints, and to do as he pleases. He thinks he can be happier thus to yield to his unrestrained lusts and desires. He is weary of seeing 'Thou shalt nots' over the gates of so many a temple of pleasure and seeming paradise. He is weary of so many restraints and laws."—Peloubet.

2. "Not many days' after, his thoughts took some form in action. 'Took his journey into a far country.' Perhaps Rome, or Corinth, where were gathered every luxury and vice. The far country is being far from God in character, in motives, in feelings, in works, in sympathy. It is estrange-ment from God, dislike of His rule, opposition to His princi-ples."—Id.

3. "To a Jew this was the most menial and degrading of employments. The youth who has boasted of his liberty, now finds himself a slave. He is in the worst of bondage,— `holden with the cords of his sins.' The glitter and tinsel that enticed him have disappeared, and he feels the burden of his chain. Sitting upon the ground, in that desolate and famine-stricken land, with no companions but the swine, he is fain to fill himself with the husks on which the beasts are fed. Of the gay companions who flocked about him in his prosperous days, and ate and drank at his expense, there is not one left to befriend him."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page

5. "Doubtless there was a terrible battle of conflicting emotions; hope, need, desire, conscience, remembrance of his father and home, struggling against doubt whether he would be received, shame for his past, conscious unworthiness, fear of the taunts of his companions. Satan's chains are not easily broken."—Peloubet.

6. " 'I have sinned.' Once, when he was fretting against the discipline of home and planning a way of escape, he called his conduct independence; in the far country, when bright eyes were shining on him and soft arms encircling him, he called it pleasure; later, after he had run through his means, and friends and lovers had forsaken him, he called it ill luck; even when he commenced his reflections in the course of com-ing to himself, he only called it folly; but now he has found the right name, when he confesses, 'I have sinned.' "—Stalker.

8. "What assurance here, of God's willingness to receive the repenting sinner! Have you, reader, chosen your own way? Have you wandered far from God? Have you sought to feast upon the fruits of transgression, only to find them turn to ashes upon your lips? And now, your substance spent, your life plans thwarted, and your hopes dead, do you sit alone and desolate? Now that voice which has long been speaking to your heart, but to which you would not listen, comes to you distinct and clear, 'Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest; because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.' Return to your Father's house. He invites you, saying, 'Return unto Me; for I have redeemed thee.' "—Id., page
