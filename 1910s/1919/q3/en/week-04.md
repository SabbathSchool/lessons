## Notes

1. "The rabbis limited the exercise of forgiveness to three offenses. Peter, carrying out, as he supposed, the teaching of Christ, thought to extend it to seven, the number signify-ing perfection."-"Christ's Object Lessons," page.

2. If Jesus meant His answer to Peter to be mathemati-cally exact, it would probably cover every case, for one brother would not be likely to need forgiveness more than four hundred and ninety times. But forgiveness, like other Christian virtues, has no limits. Jesus doubtless meant His answer to be interpreted, "As many times as he sinneth against thee."

3. Note that the king granted his servant much more than he asked; for the servant pleaded for time only, and promised to pay all, but the king forgave him the entire debt.

5. "The great lesson of the parable lies in the contrast between God's compassion and man's hard-heartedness; in the fact that God's forgiving mercy is to be the measure of our own. `Shouldst not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as. I had pity on thee?' We are not forgiven because we forgive, but as we forgive. The ground of all forgiveness is found in the unmerited love of God; but by our attitude toward others we show whether we have made that love our own."—Id., page

6. "Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit. He who is unmerciful toward others shows that he himself is not a partaker of God's pardoning grace."—/b.

7. We, like the servant in the parable, because of sin, were ten thousand talents in debt. But when we came to Jesus and asked forgiveness, He freely forgave us the whole debt. The offense of those who may have done us wrong is but a hundred pence as compared with our debt to God. If the Lord has so freely forgiven us the ten thousand talents, ought we not freely to forgive the hundred pence? Every truly forgiven soul will forgive others.

8. "Every one who has been free to condemn or discour-age, will in his own experience be brought over the ground where he has caused others to pass; he will feel what they have suffered because of his want of sympathy and tender-ness."—"Mount of Blessing," page
