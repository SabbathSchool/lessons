## Notes

2. "It is true that men sometimes become ashamed of their sinful ways, and give up some of their evil habits, before they are conscious that they are being drawn to Christ. But when-ever they make an effort to reform, from a sincere desire to do right, it is the power of Christ that is drawing them. An influence of which they are unconscious works upon the soul, and the conscience is quickened, and the outward life is amended. And as Christ draws them to look upon His cross, to behold Him whom their sins have pierced, the command-ment comes home to the conscience. The wickedness of their life, the deep-seated sin of the soul, is revealed to them."— Id., page

4. "The preaching of the Word is of no avail without the presence and aid of the Holy Spirit; for this Spirit is the only effectual teacher of divine truth.. Only when the truth is ac-companied to the heart by the Spirit, will it quicken the con-science or transform the life. A minister may be able to pre-sent the letter of the word of God; he may be familiar with all its commands and promises; but his sowing of the gospel seed will not be successful unless this seed is quickened into life by the dew of heaven. Without the cooperation of the Spirit of God, no amount of education, no advantages, how-ever great, can make one channel of light."—"Gospel Work-ers," page
