4. " 'The prince of this world cometh,' said Jesus, 'and bath nothing in Me.: There was in Him nothing that re-sponded to Satan's sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So it may be with us. Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make us partakers of the divine nature. So long as we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more do-minion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfection of character."— Id., page

5. "How this is accomplished, Christ has shown us. By what means did He overcome in the conflict with Satan? — By the word of God. Only by the Word could He resist temp-tation. 'It is written,' He said. And unto us are given 'ex-ceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the cor-ruption that is in the world through lust.' Every promise in God's word is ours. 'By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God' are we to live. When assailed by tempta-tion, look not to circumstances or to the weakness of self, but to the power of the Word.. All its strength is yours. 'Thy word,' says the psalmist, 'have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.' B. y the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.' "—Ibid.

6. "Let the soul be drawn out and upward, that God may grant us a breath of the heavenly atmosphere. We may keep so near to God that in every unexpected trial our thoughts will turn to Him as naturally as the flower turns to the sun." —"Steps to Christ," page
