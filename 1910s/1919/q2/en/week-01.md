## Notes

1. "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them. 'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? — Not one.' The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.' Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are power-less. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they cannot purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—"Steps to Christ," page •

2. "This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have re-mained at the Father's side. He might have retained the glory of heaven, and the homage of the angels. But He chose to give back the scepter into the Father's hands, and to step down from the throne of the universe, that He might bring light to the benighted, and life to the perishing."—"Desire of Ages," page

2. The death of Jesus Christ is set forth as the ground on which a righteous God can par-don a guilty and sinful race without in any way compromising His righteousness."— Wm. Evans, indtiGreat Doctrines of the Bible," page

4. Christ, by His death, buys sinners out of the market, thereby indicating complete de-liverance from the service of sin. He looses the bonds, sets the prisoners free, by paying a price — that price being His own precious blood."—Id., page

5. "Through type and promise, God 'preached before the gospel unto Abraham.' And the patriarch's faith was fixed upon the Redeemer to come. Said Christ to the Jews, 'Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see My day; and He saw it, and was glad.' The ram offered in the place of Isaac represented the Son of God, who was to be sacrificed in our stead. When man was doomed to death by transgression of the law of God, the Father, looking upon His Son, said to the sinner, 'Live: I have found a ransom.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page

6. "Jesus refused to receive the homage of His people un-til He had the assurance that His sacrifice was accepted by the Father. He ascended to the heavenly courts, and from God Himself heard the assurance that His atonement for the sins of men had been ample, that through His blood all might gain eternal life. The Father ratified the covenant made with Christ, that He would receive repentant and obedient men, and would love them even as He loves His Son. Christ was to complete His work, and fulfill His pledge to 'make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.' All power in heaven and on earth was given to the Prince of life, and He returned to His followers in a world of sin, that He might impart to them of His power and glory."—"Desire of Ages," page
