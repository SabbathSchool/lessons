## Notes

1. "Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the full-ness of His blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of boundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray so little! God is ready and willing to hear the sincere prayer of the humblest of His children, and yet there is much manifest reluctance on our part to make known our wants to God. What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God's heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little, and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only can give, seem satisfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of His presence."—"Steps to Christ," page

2. "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it is necessary, in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to Him."— Id., page

3. "We should pray in the family circle; and above all we must not neglect secret prayer, for this is the life of the soul. It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is neg-lected. Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. In solitude let the soul be laid open to the inspecting eye of God. Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God." —"Steps to Christ," page

5. "Jesus said, 'Ye shall ask in My name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father Himself loveth you.' I have chosen you,... that whatso-ever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it you.' But to pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a mere mention of that name at the beginning and the ending of a prayer. It is to pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace, and work His works."— Id., page
