## Notes

3. "The opposite and no less dangerous error is, that be-lief in Christ releases men from keeping the law of God; that since by faith alone we become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works have nothing. to do with our redemption. But notice here that obedience is not a mere outward com-pliance, but the service of love. The law of God is an ex-pression of His very nature; it is an embodiment of the great principle of love, and hence is the foundation of His govern-ment in heaven and earth. If our hearts are renewed in the likeness of God, if the divine love is implanted in the soul, will not the law of God be carried out in the life?"â€” page
