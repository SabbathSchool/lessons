## Notes

1. "There are• thousands to-day who need to learn the same truth that was taught to Nicodemus by the uplifted serpent. They depend on their obedience to the law of God to commend them to His favor. When they are bidden to look to Jesus, and believe that He saves them solely through His grace, they exclaim, 'How can these things be?"'—"De-sire of Ages," page

2. "No human invention can find a remedy for the sin-ning soul.... The fountain of the heart must be purified before the streams can become pure. He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law, is at-tempting an impossibility. There is no safety for one who has merely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Chris-tian's life is not a modification or improvement of the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. — Id., page

3. "Not all the wisdom and skill of man can produce life in the smallest object in nature. It is only through the life which God Himself has imparted, that either plant or animal can live. So it is only through the life from God that spiritual life is begotten in the hearts of men. Unless a man is 'born from above,' he cannot become a partaker of the life which Christ came to give."—"Steps to Christ," page

5. "Here is where thousands fail: they do not believe that Jesus pardons them personally, individually. They do not take God at His word. It is the privilege of all who comply with the conditions to know for themselves that pardon is freely extended for every sin. Put away the suspicion that God's promises are not meant for you. They are for every repentant transgressor. Strength and grace have been pro-vided through Christ to be brought by ministering angels to every believing soul."--(d., page
