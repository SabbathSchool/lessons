## Notes

1. "Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this union that we are to come forth from the grave,— not merely as a mani-festation of the power of Christ, but because, through faith, His life has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him-into the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the be-ginning of the life eternal."—"Desire of Ages," page

4. "The inscrutable power in us reproduces itself in us through acts of self-sacrifice, through putting away of sin, through Christian work, through loving deeds, and, in fact, in all the practical activities and strivings of the Christian life."— E. Y. Mullin, in "The Christian Religion," page

5. "Though noW He has ascended to the presence of God, and shares the throne of the universe, Jesus has lost none of His compassionate nature. To-day the same tender, sym-pathizing heart is open to all the woes of humanity. To-day the hand that was pierced is reached forth to bless more abundantly His people that are in the world. 'And they shall never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.' The soul that has given himself to Christ is more precious in His sight than the whole world. The Saviour would have passed through the agony of Calvary, that one might be saved in His kingdom. He will never abandon one for whom He has died. Unless His followers choose to leave Him, He will hold them fast."—"Desire of Ages," page
