## Notes

2. Christ's ownership of the earth and all things that are therein, and of man, is His by right, not only by creation, but by redemption as well. Through His death, Christ bought back the lost dominion; and when redemption is finished, man's Eden home will be restored to the redeemed.

4. The Lord withheld from man but one thing. He re-served the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The test was whether man, to whom was given all else in the garden, would let that alone which the Creator had reserved to Himself.

5. In the reservation of the tithe as holy to Himself, the Lord has in principle placed before man the same test that was before Adam in Eden. The test is whether man will recognize God's right of ownership, by returning to Him that which God has reserved for His own work.
