## Questions



## Notes

1. The baptism of the Holy Spirit was given to Jesus for service. In like manner, it will be given to His followers who will use it in going about doing good. "To take His yoke is one of the first conditions of receiving His power. The very life of the church depends upon her faithfulness in fulfilling the Lord's commission. To neglect this work is surely to invite spiritual feebleness and decay."—"The Desire of Ages," page

2. The disciples had been with Jesus and listened to His instruction; they had witnessed the miracles He performed in stilling the sea, healing the sick, and raising the dead; but this did not qualify them for the great work before them. They must have a personal experience in the things of God, and a baptism of the Spirit for Service. It is the same with us. No theory of truth, however correct it may be, is suffi-cient. It is the Spirit that imparts life for service.

3. "These disciples prepared themselves for their work. Before the Day of Pentecost they met together, and put away all differences. They were of one accord. They believed Christ's promise that the blessing would be given, and they prayed in faith. They did not ask for a blessing for them-selves merely; they were weighted with the burden for the salvation of souls. The gospel was to be carried to the utter-most parts of the earth, and they claimed the endowment of power that Christ had promised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit was poured out, and thousands were converted in a day. "So it may be now. Instead of man's speculations, let the Word of God be preached. Let Christians put away their dissensions, and give themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them in faith ask for the blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result. But the 'latter rain' will be more abundant."—"The Desire of Ages," page

5. "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples."—"The Desire of Ages," page
