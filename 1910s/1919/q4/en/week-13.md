## Notes

1. Just as those who plant a vineyard may rightfully eat of its fruit, or those who feed the flock may properly par-take of the milk of the flock, or those who minister about holy things of the temple receive support from the temple, "even so," or in like manner, has the Lord "ordained" (that is, set in order, established, appointed, decreed, enacted) that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel. The in-spired apostle here clearly shows that the Lord has an or-dained or established plan for the support of His workers. The Lord pays them for their labor from that which He has reserved as holy, and He has clearly set forth the source from which their support is to come. No earthly government sends out soldiers without making proper provision for their support and care; much less the perfect government of heaven.
