## Notes

2. "The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it is to obey Christ as its head. It is not to depend upon man, or be controlled by man."—"The Desire of Ages," page

4. Study the words "knit together." Bones that are broken will knit together when they have life in theth. The Spirit of life in the church will cause the members to hold together, to be knit together, to grow together. It is through Christ that all things hold together.

5. " 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of Christ. All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words have power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the conditions upon which men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach God's Word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results." —Id., page

7. "The church, endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His depositary, in which the riche's of His mercy, His grace, and His love, are to appear in full and final display." -"The Desire of Ages," page
