## Notes

2. A tithe is one tenth of our income. The difference be-tween income and increase is defined by Webster as follows: "Income, that gain which proceeds from labor, business, or property of any kind; the produce of a farm; the rent of houses, the proceeds of professional business; the profits of commerce or of occupation; the interest of money or stock in funds, etc., revenue; receipts, especially the annual receipts of a private person or corporation from property." /The total receipts from any branch of business are gross income. That portion which remains after paying wages, for material, etc., is net income. "Increase, to become greater in size, quantity, number, de-gree, value, intensity, authority, reputation, etc. To grow; to augment; to advance." One tenth of all that comes in as gain, or net income from all sources, is a tithe.

4. "In the Hebrew economy, one tenth of the income of the people was set apart to support the public worship of God.... But the tithing system did not originate with the Hebrews. From the earliest times the Lord claimed a tithe as His; and this claim was recognized and honored. Abra-ham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God. Jacob, when at Bethel, an exile and a wanderer, prom-ised the Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.' As the Israelites were about to be established as a nation, the law of tithing was reaffirmed, as one of the divinely ordained statutes upon obedience to which their prosperity depended."—"Patriarchs and Proph-ets," page

5. Upon the receipt of means, the tithe should be taken out first, and laid aside as sacred to the Lord, and as soon as possible sent on to His treasury. We should always place the Lord first in all our plans.
