## Notes

1. We are to "reckon," or count, that we are "dead indeed" to sin. Here is the secret of a victorious Christian life. When temptation even in its most enticing forms comes to us, we are to say, No, I cannot do this wicked thing. I am dead to such things. On the other hand, we are to reckon that we are "alive unto God." When Christian duties come to us, though they may involve a sacrifice, we are to say, Yes, I am alive to these things through Christ.

2. "The Christian's life is not a modification or improve-ment of the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit."—"The Desire of Ages," page

3. Buried with Christ by baptism. As we bury our loved ones who are taken from us by death, so those who die to sin are to be buried in the watery grave. Incidentally, by this figure we are taught how baptism should be administered. The sprinkling or pouring of water is not symbolical of a burial. '

5. Genuine faith in Christ and repentance of sin precede baptism. Baptism is the outward expression of an inward work. This precludes the baptism of infants not having at-tained to the years of accountability, as they cannot exercise faith in Christ, or repent of sin.

6. Paul and Silas went to Philippi in response to the vision which appeared to Paul of a man saying, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us." All the circumstances after their arrival seemed to be working to hinder the progress of the gospel; yet the Lord worked in a very marvelous way, and a company of baptized believers was developed.

7. "It is not at all improbable that some, perhaps many, among the multitude had joined in the cry of 'Crucify Him.' " — Sadler.
