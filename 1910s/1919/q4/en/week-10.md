## Notes

2. "Each one gave of what the Lord had given him. The people brought so willingly and so freely, that there was more than enough, and Moses had to issue a proclamation restraining them from giving any more. It is the free giving from a willing heart for a worthy object that brings the largest gifts. According to the best estimates, the amount of gold was about a ton and a fifth (a ton of gold is now worth about a million dollars); of the silver, about four tons and a fifth; and of bronze or copper (the Biblical brass), nearly three tons. This shows that the people gave very liberally. It is impossible to compute the exact amount per head, but it could not have been less than three dollars for each man. This would be a large average in our country; but they were a nation just escaped from slavery. Money was also worth much more among them than among us now. This, more-over, does not include the gifts of other materials, as precious stones, oil, spices, wood, wool, linen, and dyestuffs, all of which were costly, nor does it make any account of the work contributed."— Sunday School Times.

6. "Angels were so interested for man's salvation that there could be found among them those who would yield their glory and give their life for perishing man. 'But,' said my accompanying angel, 'that would avail nothing.' The trans-gression was so great that an angel's life would not pay the debt. Nothing but the death and intercession of God's Son would pay the debt, and save lost man from hopeless sorrow and misery."—"Early Writings," page

7. "In the parable, the pearl is not represented as a gift. The merchantman bought it at the price of all that he had. Many question the meaning of this, since Christ is rep-resented in the Scriptures as a gift. He is a gift, but only to those who give themselves, soul, body, and spirit, to Him without reserve."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page
