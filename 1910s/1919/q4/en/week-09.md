## Notes

2. "Systematic giving is not enough; ten cents a month for a millionaire would be systematic. Proportionate giving is not enough; a cent for every hundred dollars of income would be proportionate. What is needed is a systematic, generous proportion."— Peloubet. We are not to give to the Lord according to our own fancy, or as other people are giving, or according to other people's ability, but "every man according to his ability."

3. " 'God loveth a cheerful giver,' Paul wrote to the Corinthians, using a word [hilaron] which has been trans-lated into our 'hilarious.' God loveth such a giver. What an inheritance! What a baptism! Such a man lives in the love of the Almighty."— J. H. Jowett. "I am so impressed with the importance that God at-taches to sweet voluntariness that I am often tempted to re-solve never to beg a cent for God again, but rather spend my energy in getting Christians spiritualized, assured that they will certainly become liberalized."— A. J. Gordon.

4. "The heart of God yearns over His earthly children with a love stronger than death. In giving up His Son, He has poured out to us all heaven in one gift."—"Steps to Christ," page

24. "All things Christ received from God, but He took to give."—"The Desire of Ages," page

5. To hate is defined to mean "to regard with less affec-tion, love less, esteem less." "To love God with all the heart means not to love at all those things that would destroy our love for God. This is termed hate. But he who loves God with all his heart, will love father, mother, and all others, as no one outside of Christ can love them; but his love is, for their eternal good, that they may be saved. To love them supremely is not to love God. Such love is worldly, carnal. It will end with this life. To love God supremely means oftentimes to for-sake the dearest ties of earth; and this the world would call hatred."
