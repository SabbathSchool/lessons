## Questions

17. How was this sacred service closed? Where did Jesus and His disciples go? 

## Notes

1. "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect ex-emplification of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things, He is constantly ministering for others."—"The Desire of Ages," page

17. Referring to the disciples, this statement is made: "Many of their contentions for supremacy, much of their dissatis-faction with Christ's methods, originated with Judas."— "Education," page

92. "Before honor is humility. To fill a high place before men, Heaven chooses the worker who, like John the Baptist, takes a lowly place before God."—"The Desire of Ages," page

436. "The strife probably began when the disciples were as-sembled in the upper room, and were about to take their places at the table."— Peloubet.

4. "This action opened the eyes of the disciples. Bitter shame and humiliation filled their hearts. They understood the unspoken rebuke, and saw themselves in altogether a new light."-"The Desire of Ages," page

5. "Gave thanks." "From the Greek word eucharistesas, thus translated, comes The Eucharist, i. e., The Thanksgiving, as the name of the Lord's Supper."- Peloubet. "Drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." "The thought of the meeting again is brought in to brighten the gloom of the leave-taking." Neither here nor in eternity will Jesus again meet all His disciples around the table. Judas will be missing.

6. If through faith the believer discerns by these emblems His Lord dying on Calvary to atone for his sins, having con-fessed them, he is not eating and drinking "unworthily."

7. The Saviour bears His people upon His heart, and looks forward with joy to that time when He will be surrounded in His kingdom with the whole family of the redeemed.
