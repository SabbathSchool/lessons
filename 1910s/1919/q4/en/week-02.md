## Questions

2. What is the Lord's admonition to the church? 

## Notes

1. "As the angel from heaven rolled away the stone, the other entered the tomb, and unbound the wrappings from the body of Jesus. But it was the Saviour's hand that folded each, and laid it in its place. In His sight who guides alike the star and the atom, there is nothing unimportant. Order and perfection are seen in all His work."—"The Desire of Ages," page

2. In a comment on this verse, "Conybeare and Howson" say, "Not simply 'set in order,' but set in order farther." Evidently the great apostle believed fully in the most perfect order and organization in the church under his care; and desiring that this work should be more fully perfected than he was able to do while with them, he left his faithful and tried helper to complete the work.

3. "As an important factor in the spiritual growth of the new converts, the apostles were careful to surround them with the safeguards of gospel order. Churches were duly organized in all places in Lycaonia and Pisidia, where there were believers. Officers were appointed in each church, and proper order and system was established for the conduct of all the affairs pertaining to the spiritual welfare of the believers."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

5. The work of feeding the flock over which one is placed by the Holy Spirit as an "overseer" is a weighty responsi-bility. It calls for study, the deepest piety, and the most godly life.

6. The importance of this counsel cannot be overestimated. Unless those who lead and instruct the church are in harmony with the Word of God and the message for the time, they will bewilder the flock, and confusion and error will result. Especially at this time, when every wind of doctrine is blow-ing, the church overseers should be "sound in the faith."

7. The position of a deacon is a responsible one. He stands next to the elder, and in a very special way should share the burdens of the church.

8. There are other important offices in the church, such as treasurer, clerk, deaconess, etc., which require capable, consecrated persons to carry on the work properly.
