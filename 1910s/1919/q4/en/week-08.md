1. "The tenth commandment strikes at the very root of all sins, prohibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the sinful act."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," page

3. The Revised Version renders this text, "For the wicked boasteth of his heart's, desire, and the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth Jehovah." No deep-seated love for God can dwell in a covetous heart.

4. "God cannot approve of the least degree of covetousness or selfishness, and He abhors the prayers and exhortations of those who indulge these evil traits. As Satan sees that his time is short, he leads men on to be more and more selfish and covetous, and then exults as he sees them wrapped up in themselves, close, penurious, and selfish. If the eyes of such could be opened, they would see Satan in hellish triumph, ex-ulting over them, and laughing at the folly of those who ac-cept his suggestions and enter his snares."-"Early Writ-ings," page

5. "Every selfish, covetous person will fall out by the way. Like Judas, who sold his Lord, they will sell good principles and a noble, generous disposition for a little of earth's gain."—"Early Writings," page

7. "The practice of the truths that Christ taught was at variance with his [Judas's] desires and purposes, and he could not bring himself to yield his ideas in order to receive wisdom from heaven. Instead of walking in the light, he chose to walk in darkness. Evil desires, covetousness, re-vengeful passions, dark and sullen thoughts, were cherished until Satan gained full control of him."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

8. "If the reservoir be poisoned or polluted, then all the water drawn from the various faucets in the house will be poisoned or polluted. If the heart is polluted with covetous-ness, the deeds from the hands and the words from the mouth will be evil."— Peloubet.
