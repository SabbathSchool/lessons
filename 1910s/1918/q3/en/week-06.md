## Notes

9. Worldliness and compromise and dependence on fleshly power must ever work the same. Note that the principles in-volved in each stage of the great controversy are living issues for all time.

23. As worldliness and com-mercialism came in, the oil and wine of the Spirit's grace leaked out. The price of a measure of wheat indicates scarcity—a famine of the word of the Lord.

6. Just as truly as though they were speaking, God says they are remembered, the white robes await them, but let them rest till the suffering of God's people, yet to come, is over, and all shall be rewarded together. God may yet be glorified by the death of some who study this lesson.
