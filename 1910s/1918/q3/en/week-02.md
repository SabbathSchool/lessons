## Notes

2. Therefore, according to the Lord's word, the Lord's day is identical with the Lord's Sabbath. The Bible knows no other Sabbath. It is the day designated of God to honor the Creator and the Redeemer, for creative power is equally demanded in both. The memorial of crea-tion became a window of heaven. "In the Spirit" clearly means, as the context shows, "in vision."
