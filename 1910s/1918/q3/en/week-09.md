## Notes

1. "A great voice." The message is more important than the messenger. It may have been Gabriel's voice, or a voice from the elders, but that matters not to us; it gave a great message. The mighty John the Baptist was content to be "a voice" for God "crying in the wilderness."

9. The King was ready. He waits till His subjects are gathered, then will He claim His own. "And the power of His Christ." Authority succeeds power. Earthly rulers often claim authority without power. Authority—power—did not come to Jesus till He visibly merited it. Not till after His resurrection did He say, "All power [authority] is given unto Me in heaven and in earth." Salvation, power, kingdom, authority, are ours, in Him.

4. The heavens may well rejoice; for no more will there be an accuser at heaven's gates, to attribute false motives to God's servants.

5. Woe to the earth; the devil is here. He could not conquer the heavenly King; he will strive against that King's earthly subjects. Desperate, failing in his great attack, he will do all in his power to destroy others. Take home to heart the warning, and know that the power to conquer awaits you in Jesus.

6. Note that in this chapter, the dragon, the devil, is the primal persecutor, because he is the deceiver. It will give us more charity for his human tools and agents and dupes if we will appreciate his evil lordship. As far as we have influence, we should labor to save them from the snares of his evil principles and devices. The church militant is still left to struggle against the mighty foe, to fail if she forgets her Lord, to triumph if her faith abides in Him. The persecutions began immediately, but reached their worst under the long papal period of per-secution; but behind both pagan and papal was the devil.

8. "Water as a flood" fitly represents the armies sent to destroy the faithful followers of Christ.
