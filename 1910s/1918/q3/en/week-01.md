## Notes

2. To reveal, disclose, unroll the vital past, the living present, the great future, with its fearful trials and perse-cutions, even then beginning.

4. "The time is at hand." The developments of early Christianity were already beginning. The power of the gospel had reached all lands. The incipient stages of the great apostasy were present. The time was at hand, for the great revelation was then unfolding. How infinitely more important it is to us to give heed now, when "the time is at hand" that the great drama is about to close!

5. "To the seven churches which are in Asia." These seven churches in Asia represent the seven great dominat-ing conditions in the church during the period between the two advents. Vincent, in his "Word Studies in the New Testament," says: "Not all the churches in Asia are meant, since the list of those addressed in the Apocalypse does not include Colossi, Miletus, Herapolis, or Magnesia. The seven names are chosen to symbolize the whole church.... We have in these seven a representation of the church universal." In each church, there was that named which was typical of the conditions of the period it represented.

6. The second coming of our Lord is not a "secret rap-ture," but open, glorious, attended by clouds of angels, whom all the earth will see.
