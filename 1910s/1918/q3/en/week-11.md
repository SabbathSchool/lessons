3. Not "before him" in the sense of time, but "in his sight," "in his presence." That is, the two-horned beast exercises in his own domain all the authority that the first beast did and does in his domain.

4. As the first beast compelled the worship of the dragon by enforcing his principles, so the two-horned beast causes the worship of the first beast by enforcing the principles of that beast. Note also that it is the restored first beast, for his "deadly wound was healed."

39. Men have witnessed some of these wonders. More will be seen. All these are wrought to deceive.

7. The mark of the beast must be the distinguishing characteristic of the beast and his worshipers, and that which will distinguish them from the worshipers of God. God's mark, or seal, is His holy Sabbath, the seventh day. See lesson
