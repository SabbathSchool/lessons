## Notes

1. Very true and loyal was the early church. Devoted to God and having no fellowship with evil, she suffered trial for His name's sake, and did not grow weary. Ephesus also hated the works of the abominable Nicolaitanes, reputed to have held that the flesh could indulge its passions without contaminating the soul. They were strong antinomians, or no-law advocates.

3. He who suffered, died, and rose again comes to en-courage the suffering ones in Smyrna.

29. God knows, as He knows all the churches. How much better that He know our faithful-ness in suffering for Him rather than our unfaithfulness in prosperity!

6. The promise fits the trial. Death may await the per-secuted, but there is life forevermore beyond.
