2. The seven heads and the ten horns connect this beast with the dragon. That the beast is religious is shown by the names of blasphemy. One of the definitions of blasphemy is, claiming the attributes of God.

14. He has molded and used all the various forms under which that system has existed from Babylon down. When Babylon passed away, Medo-Persia succeeded, then Greece, then Rome; and the old religious mysteries,—perversive, oppressive, as-sumptive, and blasphemous,—were manifest in them all. It was through Rome pagan that Rome papal succeeded to empire.

8. Surely the papacy has made war with the saints, whom she denominated pernicious heretics. She does not deny the punishment of heretics. She holds that they are the enemies of both church and state, and therefore ought to be punished with death if need be.
