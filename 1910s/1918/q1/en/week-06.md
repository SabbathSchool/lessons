## Notes

2. "For eighteen centuries this work of ministration con-tinued in the first apartment of the sanctuary. The blood of Christ, pleaded in behalf of penitent believers, secured their pardon and acceptance with the Father, yet their sins still remained upon the books of record. As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the close of the year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of men is completed, there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin from the sanctuary. This is the service which began when the two thousand three hundred days ended. At that time, as foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High Priest en-tered the most holy, to perform the last division of His solemn work,—to cleanse the sanctuary."—Id., page
