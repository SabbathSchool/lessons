## Notes

1. The application of the ram and the goat is so clearly given in the explanation of the vision that there can be no misunderstanding of these symbols. The power that is repre-sented by the little horn, which became "exceeding great," is the power that succeeded Grecia. It is a matter of history that Rome was the universal monarchy that ruled the world after Greece was conquered. The little horn covers Rome both pagan and papal.

2. If all would manifest the interest and earnestness that Daniel did in the endeavor to gain an understanding of the prophecies, there would be far less ignorance on those subjects than is now manifest.
