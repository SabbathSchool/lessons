## Notes

2. We are here told of the attributes of God, the charac-teristics in which we differ from Him. God is eternal; He always existed. We are not eternal, but finite; we came but recently into existence. God is invisible, "whom no man hath seen or can see." We are not invisible. God is omniscient He knows all things. We know but very little. In the matter of immortality there is just as striking a contrast. God is immortal. It would be just as erroneous to suppose that we naturally possess the attribute of immortality as to suppose that we possess omnipotence, or omniscience, or any other attribute of the Deity.
