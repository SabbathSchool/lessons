## Questions

5. How dependent is creation upon the ministry of the Son? 

## Notes

1. Only the eternal Son, one with the Father, could reveal God. The Son is "the image of the invisible God."

2. All things and all beings owe their existence to the working of God through Jesus Christ.

4. By virtue of His personal relation to the Father, the Son of God was the agent through whom the original act of creation was performed, and the mediatorial principle is inherent in the very nature of His being. He was and is the mediator between the Father and all His created works. "The restriction of the thought of mediatorship and sac-rifice to the gracious intervention of the eternal Son on behalf of fallen and sinful man has narrowed and thrown out of its proper proportion our thought of the dignity and the glory of the Son, and of the grandeur of His work.... The stand-ing truth, that, from the first instant of creation, there has been a mediator between the Father and creation, one through whom, necessarily, creation came into being, renders it easier for us to apprehend alike the necessity, and (such is the love of God) the probability, of an atoning mediator who should undo the mischief of sin; and, this being so, the impossibility that it can be any other than the untreated mediator, through whom and for whom were all things made, the eternal Son."â€” "The One Mediator," P. G. Medd, page

5. In both of these texts, the margin of the Revised Ver-sion suggests "creation" in place of "creature."

6. The eternal Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was the mediator in the original creation, is necessarily the mediator in the new creation. Only He who mediated in the material creation can be the mediator in the spiritual creation, since both require the same manifestation of the same infinite power. This excludes all created beings from acting in a mediatorial capacity, and is an all-sufficient answer to the claims in behalf of the Roman Catholic priesthood.

1. There is only one mediator.

2. That mediator is the eternal Son of God.

3. The mediatorial work of the Son in the gospel is a necessary consequence of His wider mediatorial relationship to the Father in respect to all things.

4. The success of the Son as mediator in creating and upholding all things is the guarantee of His success in re-creating and upholding fallen man.
