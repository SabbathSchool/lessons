## Notes

2. "Those who in the Judgment are 'accounted worthy,' will have a part in the resurrection of the just. Jesus said, `They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead,... are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.' And again He declares that 'they that have done good' shall come forth 'unto the resurrection of life.'. Hence they will not be present in person at the tribunal when their records are examined, and their cases decided. "Jesus will appear as their Advocate, to plead in their behalf before God."—Id., page

6. " 'A book of remembrance' was written before God, in which are recorded the good deeds of 'them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name.' Their words of faith, their acts of love, are registered in heaven.... In the book of God's remembrance every deed of righteousness is immor-talized. There every temptation resisted, every evil overcome, every word of tender pity expressed. is faithfully chronicled." —"The Great Controversy," page
