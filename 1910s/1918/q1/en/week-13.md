## Notes

1. Without the Spirit, no truly effective witness can be borne. We are to remember that only the Lord, by His Spirit, can make our service effective. Christ is our example in the Continuous confession, "I can of mine own self do nothing." On the other hand, with the Spirit's witness, the feeblest en-deavor or testimony may be used of God for the accomplish-ment of great results.
