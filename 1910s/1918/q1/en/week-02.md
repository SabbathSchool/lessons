## Notes

5. "In the early beginnings of human history and under the earliest dispensations, priesthood was connected with primo-geniture. The first-born was the priest. This primeval ordi-nance was the earthly and human reflection of the divine pre-rogative of the Son of God."â€”"The One Mediator," P. G. Medd, page

2. The Son of God became the Son of man. Divinity and humanity met in Him, and He thus formed the meeting place between God and man.

13. Christ declared Himself to be "the way." Through His mediatorial relation to God the Father, He is God's way out to all that is outside of Himself; through His mediatorial relation to man, He is the "new and living way" for man back to God.

5. One of the fundamental doctrines of Protestantism is the priesthood of all believers as opposed to the priestly caste in the Roman Catholic Church.
