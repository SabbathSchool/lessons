## Notes

1. Necromancy is defined to be "the art of revealing future events by means of a pretended communication with the dead; the art of magic; conjuration; enchantment."

2. It is evident, from these texts, that the ancient Israel-ites were seduced into the belief that they were having inter-course with the dead when they were actually sacrificing to, and having communication with, the devil.

4. Modern spiritualism, whose millions of adherents in-clude even royal heads, began its demonstrations nearly three-score and ten years ago, in opposition to the warning of the third angel's message, which had then just begun its great mission to prepare a people for the second coming of Christ. "To-day the mysteries of heathen worship are replaced by the secret associations and seances, the obscurities and won-ders, of spiritualistic mediums. The disclosures of these mediums are eagerly received by thousands who refuse to accept light from God's word or through His Spirit. Be-lievers in spiritism may speak with scorn of the magicians of old, but the great deceiver laughs in triumph as they yield to his arts under a different form. "There are many who shrink with horror from the thought of consulting spirit mediums, but who are attracted by more pleasing forms of spiritism. Others are led astray by the teachings of Christian Science, and by the mysticism of the-osophy and other Oriental religions."—"Prophets and Kings," page
