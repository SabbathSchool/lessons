## Notes

171. "Could our spiritual vision be quickened, we should see souls bowed under oppression and burdened with grief, pressed as a cart beneath sheaves, and ready to die in discouragement. We should see angels flying quickly to the aid of these tempted ones, forcing back the hosts of evil that encompass them, and placing their feet on the sure foundation. The battles waging between the two armies are as real as those fought by the armies of this world, and on the issue of the spiritual conflict eternal destinies depend."—Id., page

2. "All the heavenly angels are at the service of the humble, believing people of God; and as the Lord's army of workers here below sing their songs of praise, the choir above join with them in ascribing praise to God and to His Son. "We need to understand better than we do the mission of the angels. It would be well to remember that every true child of God has the cooperation of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power 'attend the meek and lowly ones who believe and claim the, promises of God. Cherubim and seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's right hand, 'all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page
