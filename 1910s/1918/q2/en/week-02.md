## Notes

2. When Israel lost her connection with God and became a nation of common sinners, her special privileges were taken from her. This involved the suspension of God's material, visible kingdom that had been committed to her special care.

3. The fact that worshipers of Jehovah were captives in Babylon, and that the vessels of God's house had been placed in the temple of the Babylonish gods, was boastfully cited by the victors as evidence that their religion and customs were superior to the religion and customs of the Hebrews. Yet through the very humiliations that Israel's departure from Him had invited, God gave Babylon evidence of His suprem-acy, of the holiness of His requirements, and of the sure results of obedience. And this testimony He gave, as alone it could be given, through those who were loyal to Him.

6. Many have been the attempts, and various the means employed, to unite the fragments of the old Roman empire into a permanent whole. Charles V is said to have attempted it; but he failed. Napoleon had an idea of building an empire of military might to cover all western Europe. He ended his days on the island of St. Helena, his purposes brought to naught. The prophecy had said that the kingdom would be divided, and that the parts would never cleave together again.
