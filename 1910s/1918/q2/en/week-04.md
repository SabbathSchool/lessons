## Notes

1. "The words 'Thou art this head of gold,' had made a deep impression upon the ruler's mind. The wise men of his realm, taking advantage of this and of his return to idolatry, proposed that he make an image similar to the one seen in his dream, and set it up where all might behold the head of gold, which had been interpreted as representing his kingdom."— "The Story of Prophets and Kings," page

2. "Pleased with the flattering suggestion, he determined to carry it out, and to go even farther. Instead of reproduc-ing the image as he had seen it, he would excel the original. His image should not deteriorate in value from the head to the feet, but should be entirely of gold,—symbolic throughout of Babylon as an eternal, indestructible, all-powerful king-dom, which should break in pieces all other kingdoms, and stand forever."—Id., page

4. "How did that heathen king know what the Son of God was like? The Hebrew captives filling positions of trust in Babylon had in life and character represented before him the truth. When asked for a reason of their faith, they had given it without hesitation. Plainly and simply they had presented the principles of righteousness, thus teaching those around them of the God whom they worshiped. They had told of Christ, the Redeemer to come; and in the form of the fourth in the midst of the fire the king recognized the Son of God."— Id., page

6. "The three Hebrews declared to the whole nation of Babylon their faith in Him whom they worshiped. They re-lied on God. In the hour of their trial they remembered the promise, 'When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.' And in a marvelous manner their faith in the living Word had been honored in the sight of all. The tidings of their wonderful deliverance were carried to many countries by the representa-tives of the different nations that had been invited by Nebu-chadnezzar to the dedication. Through the faithfulness of His children, God was glorified in all the earth."—Id., page
