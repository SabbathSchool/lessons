## Notes

2. "It was, not long before reverses came. Babylon was besieged by Cyrus, nephew of Darius the Mede, and com-manding general of the combined armies of the Medes and Persians. But within the seemingly impregnable fortress, with its massive walls and its gates of brass, protected by the river Euphrates, and stocked with provision in abundance, the voluptuous monarch felt safe, and passed his time in mirth and revelry."—Id., page.

3. "Every nation that has come upon the stage of action has been permitted to occupy its place on the earth, that the fact might be determined whether it would fulfill the pur-poses of the Watcher and the Holy One. Prophecy has traced the rise and progress of the world's great empires,—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each of these, as with the nations of less power, history has repeated itself. Each has had its period of test; each has failed, its glory faded, its power departed."—Id., page

4. "The history of nations speaks to us to-day. To every nation and to every individual God has assigned a place in His great plan. To-day men and nations are being tested by the plummet in the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All are by their own choice deciding their destiny, and God is overruling all for the accomplishment of His purposes."—Id.. page
