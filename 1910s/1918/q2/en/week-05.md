## Notes

1. "Once more in this idolatrous nation, testimony was to be borne to the fact that only those who love and fear God can understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. The king in his perplexity sent for his servant Daniel, a man es-teemed for his integrity and constancy and for his unrivaled wisdom."—"The Story of Prophets and Kings," page

3. "The once proud monarch had become a humble child of God; the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise and com-passionate king. He who had defied and blasphemed the God of heaven, now acknowledged the power of the Most High, and earnestly sought to promote the fear of Jehovah and the happiness of his subjects. Under the rebuke of Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned at last the lesson which all rulers need to learn,—that true greatness consists in true goodness. He acknowledged Je-hovah as the living God, saying, 'I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and His ways judgment: and those that walk in pride He is able to abase.' "—Id., page
