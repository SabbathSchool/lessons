## Notes

3. The seventh year of Artaxerxes, when the command-ment went forth, was B. C.

457. "This date of the seventh year—so important to ascertain—is fixed by the combined record of sacred and profane history with uncommon ac-curacy." One important witness is the canon of Ptolemy, giving the years of the reigns of the kings of ancient empires from the days of Assyria to his own time, in the days of Rome.

34. At that time, through the action of the Jewish Sanhedrin, the nation sealed its rejection of the gospel, by the martyrdom of Stephen and the persecution of the followers of Christ. Then the message of salvation, no longer restricted to the chosen people, was given to the world. The disciples, forced by persecution to flee from Jerusalem, 'went everywhere preaching the Word.' `Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.' Peter, divinely guided, opened the gospel to the centurion of Cwsarea, the God-fearing Cornelius; and the ardent Paul, won to the faith of Christ, was commissioned to carry the glad tidings 'far hence unto the gentiles.'

1844. `Then,' said the angel, 'shall the sanctuary be cleansed.' All the preceding specifications of the prophecy had been un-questionably fulfilled at the time appointed."—Id., page
