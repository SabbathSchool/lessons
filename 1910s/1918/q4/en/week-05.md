## Notes

2. The only riches that will endure the fires of the last days are the "riches of Christ." The only clothing that will protect from God's wrath is the robe of Christ's righteous-ness. The adornment that will shine the brightest is the adornment of a "meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."

3. These descriptions throughout most graphically set forth the commercialism that will permeate the whole of Christendom in the last days. Men will sacrifice religious principle and even honor for wealth. Nations will contend for commercial supremacy, and the worldly church becomes partaker in the world's spirit. But when the whole com-mercial structure falls to the ground, and worldly expecta-tions and ambitions are ruthlessly swept away by the last judgments of God, there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.
