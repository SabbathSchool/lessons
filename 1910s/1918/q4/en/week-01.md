## Notes

3. The first angel's message was to proclaim "the ever-lasting gospel"—the one gospel that has been from the be-ginning in a setting adapted to the conditions which would prevail when that message was due. The very words of the message are given. The one who preaches the gospel under the first angel's message must say, "The hour of His Judg-ment is come." He must urge men to worship the Creator— the One who made the heaven and the earth. Any message not embracing these features is not the fullness of the gospel for these last days.

4. Creative power is the distinguishing attribute of Deity. God only can create He desires men to remember His mighty work of creation, that they may believe in His power to re-create them in Christ Jesus. To destroy faith in God as the Creator is to undermine the very foundation of the Christian religion, which rests on God's ability and willing-ness to save. Creation is the demonstration of God's power. Calvary demonstrates His love. He can and He will save sinful men.

119. Thus Babylon was founded in pride and self-exaltation, in disbelief of God's promise, in disobedience to God's word, and in an effort to obtain salvation by their own works. Modern Babylon exhibits the same characteristics.

7. "The great city which reigned over the kings of the earth in John's time was Rome, and that city has given its name to the church which is represented by the woman, the Church of Rome, or the papacy."—"Bible Readings," page

255. "The Church of Rome is called Babylon, and its re-ligion is a revival of the religion, of ancient Babylon. She claims a priesthood with exceptional. powers and privileges, just as did ancient Babylon.... She claims universal spiritual jurisdiction, and demands submission under pains and penalties, just as ancient Babylon did. See Daniel

30. "—Id., page

256. As ancient Babylon stood for the great system of apostasy from the truth of God and for the exaltation of human power to the place of God, so the great apostasy from God's truth in modern times is called Babylon, including not only the papal apostasy, but all systems that drink in the papal principles.
