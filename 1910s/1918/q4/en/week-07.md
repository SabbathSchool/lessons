## Notes

1. "Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now a `man of sorrows,' to drink the bitter cup of shame and woe, He comes, victor in heaven and earth, to judge the living and the dead. 'Faithful and true,' in righteousness He doth judge and make war.' And 'the armies which were in heaven follow Him.' With anthems of celestial melody, the holy angels, a vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way. The firmament seems filled with radiant forms,—`ten thou-sand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.' No human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate to conceive its splendor. "Before His presence, 'all faces are turned into paleness;' upon the rejecters of God's mercy falls the terror of eternal despair."—"The Great Controversy," page

3. Many who make loud professions of loyalty to Jesus are refusing real allegiance of heart to the King of heaven. Those who cherish impure thoughts, or perform un-Christ- like acts, or manifest an unchristian temper, are saying in their hearts, "We will not have this Man to reign over us."
