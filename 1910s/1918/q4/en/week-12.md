## Notes

19. Some of the things of which he writes took place in his day, some immediately after. So he could say, "The time is at hand"â€”that is, the time when these prophecies begin to be fulfilled. Other parts would not be fulfilled for a long time; those are "the things which shall be hereafter." But again, the close of one's probation is always "at hand." The on gest life of man is but a vapor that passes away, a short time to prepare for eternity. At death, every man's probation ends. God wants us to think always of the end of probation and the coming of Christ as "at hand."

2. Sometimes we hear carping critics say of some one who seems to be at fault, "If A goes to heaven, I don't want to go there." Well, perhaps A will not go to heaven; but it is quite certain that such unforgiving accusers will not enter the pearly gates; and if A is shut out, they will be outside with him, and with "dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie." Better be inside with A, if the Lord in His mercy sees fit to take him in, than be outside with the other company. On the word "sorcerer," the Century Bible notes say, "Here the word is probably used literally of the whole class of necromancers and dealers in magic, who flourished so greatly at this period."
