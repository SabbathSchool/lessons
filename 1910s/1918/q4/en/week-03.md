## Notes

628. The word "noisome" means noxious, annoying or "very disagreeable to the sense of smell." One thinks of the ter-rible smell of putrid flesh which accompanies certain dis-eased conditions. This plague is similar in character to the sixth of the plagues of Egypt, when painful and loathsome boils and tumors afflicted man and beast.

2. "By condemning the people of God to death, they have as truly incurred the guilt of their blood as if it had been shed by their hands. In like manner Christ declared the Jews of His time guilty of all the blood of holy men which had been shed since the days of Abel; for they possessed the same spirit, and were seeking to do the same work, with these murderers of the prophets."—Id., page
