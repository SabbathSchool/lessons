## Notes

1. Both Isaiah and John drew their imagery from the Eastern custom of separating the juice from the grapes by tramping them out with the feet. Clusters of ripe grapes are thrown into a large vat, and several men with bare feet tread out the wine. The juice spatters the garments of the workmen. This process of treading out the grapes is com-mon in Bible lands to this day.

2. God takes no pleasure in the death of any of the creatures of His hand. And when even infinite mercy de-mands that sin, and consequently sinners, come to an end, the work of destruction will be even to God a strange act.

3. Here songs become old and worn. There upon the sea of glass, the one hundred forty-four thousand Al sing a new and living song, which will never grow old. It will be a song of experience. "These are they which came out of great tribulation." They will have passed through the "time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation." They will have stood without an intercessor while the judg-ments of God have fallen upon the wicked. They alone who have had the experience can sing the song. It is called the song of Moses and the Lamb. Like Moses and Christ, the one hundred forty-four thousand pass through trial and tribulation triumphant; and with them, they can sing the song of victory.
