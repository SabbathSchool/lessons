## Notes

1. Let it be noticed that Jesus saw all the gifts, and comprehended their value as money was at that time counted. He beheld the "much" cast in by the "many" who were "rich." He also saw the little cast in by the poor. He saw infinitely more than all this. He accurately balanced the gift with the circumstances of the giver. The value in His sight was not altogether measured by the amount cast in. Jesus looked into the hearts of the givers, and beheld the motive prompting the gift. This "how" the givers gave above all else made the offering either of little value or precious in the eyes of the Master. The many rich cast in a little of their surplus. The destitute widow put in "out of her deficiency, all as much as she had... the whole of her living."— Rotherham.

2. "Two mites: The word translated mite denotes a small coin made of brass — the smallest in use among the Jews. The precise value cannot be easily estimated. It was much less than any coin we have, as the farthing was less than an English farthing. It was in value about three mills and a half, or one third of a cent."— Barnes's Notes.

3. "Many of the rich brought large sums, which they presented with great ostentation. Jesus looked upon them sadly, but made no comment on their liberal offerings. Presently His countenance lighted as He saw a poor widow approach hesitatingly, as though fearful of being observed. As the rich and haughty swept by, to deposit their offerings, she shrank back as if hardly daring to venture farther. And yet she longed to do something, little though it might be, for the cause she loved. She looked at the gift in her hand. It was very small in comparison with the gifts of those around her, yet it was her all. Watching her opportunity, she hurriedly threw in her two mites, and turned to hasten away. But in doing this she caught the eye of Jesus, which was fastened earnestly upon her.

"The Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark the widow's poverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon her ear: 'Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.' Tears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that her act was understood and appreciated... Jesus understood her motive."—"Desire of Ages," pages 614, 615.

4. "It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made. Divine benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was impossible for God to give more [as was also true of the poor widow in our lesson]. He 'so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish; but have everlasting life.' Why is our gratitude so limited? It is only as a ripple on the surface, compared with the great tide of love that flows to us from the Father."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 59, 60. John 3:16; 2 Cor. 9:8.

5. "As the disciples bore the message of the Greeks to Jesus and awaited His answer, He seemed to be in a deep study, and answered them: 'The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.' The request of the Greeks to see Jesus brought the future before Him... Jesus regarded these Greeks as representatives of the Gentiles at large. In them He discerned the first-fruits of an abundant harvest, when all nations, tongues, and people upon the face of the earth should hear the glad tidings of salvation through Christ. He saw that the gathering of the Gentiles was to follow His approaching death."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 74, 75.

This same principle holds good in our dedication of property to the cause of God. We cannot give it and keep it at the same time. That which is placed upon the altar is expected to be consumed. But, like the kernel of wheat, it perishes only to bring forth an abundant harvest later. That which dies, multiplies, and so is saved; that which is preserved, abides alone, and in the end is lost.
