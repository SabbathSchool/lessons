## Notes

1. The records of Joseph, given by the four evangelists, are independent, and though differing in language and particulars, are not contradictory. He seems not to have been called to the meetings of the Sanhedrin when Jesus was tried, though he was a member. In a time of great need he comes forward, "boldly," we are told by one evangelist, but "secretly" by another, so as to stir up no violent clamor or trouble, which would have been particularly unseemly at such a time. He furnishes his own new tomb for the Master.

2. Nicodemus at first came to Jesus by night; but it was a night which brought light to his soul. He next dared raise his voice before the Sanhedrin demanding fair treatment of Jesus. "Doth our law condemn any man before it hear him, and know what he doeth?" he said. Now he comes forward in this time of peril and utter need to identify himself with the Crucified One, who was lifted up.

3. "Who shall roll us away the stone?" This was a natural, human question. How many times we ask it in our blindness and unbelief. We seek the realization of our hopes in the places of the dead, and dream them locked. But when we reach them our doubts are solved, the stones are rolled away, our dead hopes are transmuted by God's power into living blessings, our sleeping friend into a living Saviour.
