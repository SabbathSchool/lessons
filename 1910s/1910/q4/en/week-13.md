## Notes

1. It is not likely that any among the eleven doubted. The doubters must have been among the others who gathered at that time, perhaps among the five hundred brethren mentioned by Paul.

2. Better "all authority" as in the A.R.V. The word is not dunamis, power, but authority (exousia), including ability, place, rulership, right to exercise power. The word dunamis is used in Acts 1:8. "'All power is given unto Me.' Did you ever think how much power there is on earth? There is the power of the wind. Do you know of anybody who can control that? There is the power of the waves. Do you know of anybody who can master them? There are the powers of nature; the heaving of the tides; the swelling of the seeds in the earth; the mighty upspringing that clothes the fields with grass. There is the power of the clouds. There is the power of heat in which the strongest iron that ever was forged will melt. There is the power which pours down floods from on high. . . . Think of the millions of glowing orbs that flame through the skies. Think of this world rolling in its mighty orbit. Think of the sun, sweeping on in its eternal pathway. Think of the power that moves these things. Some people do not understand how the sun could be made to stand still. Well, if you will tell me what keeps it going, I will tell you how it was made to stand still. All power in the universe. . . . All power over men; all power over devils; all power over everything. 'All power.' You have no power over the winds, but He could speak to the winds and they obeyed Him. You have no power over the waves, but He could say, 'Peace, be still,' and there was a great calm. You have no power over 'all manner of diseases,' but when He spoke to the sick, He healed them. You have no power over evil spirits, but He cast out devils with His word. You have no power over the dead, but He called them from the silence of the tomb and bade them live." — H. L. Hastings.

3. The instruction imparted in Luke 24:44, 45 at first glance appears to be given in the upper room the day of the resurrection when the disciples returned from Emmaus. But James P. Cadman, in "Christ in the Gospel," in giving the chronological order of the events and words of Christ, gives it as His parting instruction; and a careful reading of the chapter to the end indicates that he is perhaps correct. As we have followed largely the arrangement of Mr. Cadman in these lessons on the life of Christ, we follow it here also, without offering any argument as to the exact order of events. A careful study of the instruction given is the vital thing.

4. Not to Bethany, but as far as to Bethany, to the brow of Olivet, that wonderful mountain so full of rich remembrances, and to which He will come at the close of the thousand years. Zech. 14:4, 5.

5. O for the same spirit now of self-renunciation, and giving all for the Master, as was manifested in the lives of the apostles; for the same love for the mission entrusted to us; for the same faith; for the same devotion to the personal Christ and His soon coming again; for the same reception of the Holy Spirit in its fullness of power to cleanse from sin, to fit for labor, to witness for the Master. How soon would His message for this time go "everywhere" confirmed by the power of God. Let us believe His Word, and believing, receive His life.
