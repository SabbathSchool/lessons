## Notes

1. The record alludes to a time when this appointment was made to meet the disciples in Galilee. It was doubtless on one of the occasions when Jesus met with the disciples. Jesus desired to meet with them again in the field of their early labors where some of His mighty miracles were wrought.

2. "The prophecy is a picture of Peter's strong, assertive action, going impulsively where he chose, just as a few minutes before he had girded himself and plunged through the shoal water to Jesus' feet. But in his old age he would stretch forth his hands in unwonted helplessness, perhaps to allow them to be fastened to the transverse beams of a cross; and the executioner would gird him, fastening him to the cross with cords; and he should be carried to death against his natural will, though glad thus to suffer for his Lord." — Peloubet's Notes on John 21.

3. "It was probably in impatience, as if John were intruding without warrant, that he asked, Lord, and what shall this man do? Perhaps, however, the question arose only from a natural curiosity to know his friend's fate, now that he knew his own. Christ rebuked Peter by the sharp question, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? The rebuke was twofold. It implied Peter would better concern himself with asking what he should do than with thought about another's conduct — a lesson we all need to learn." — Id.
