## Notes

1. From the haughty Annas Jesus is taken before the imperious Caiaphas, a Sadducee, and the legal head, by permission of Rome, of the Jewish Sanhedrin.

2. Though Peter had forsaken Jesus and fled, he still loved his Master. He must see Him, even to the end. Matt. 26:58. But he "followed Him afar off." The devil's most effective temptations come to us when we are following "afar off." Let there be no doubt where you stand; follow close to the Master, and no one will ask, "Are you this Man's disciple?"

3. The Sanhedrin was the regular Jewish legal court, but without the power to sentence to death. It was the death of Jesus, however, which they hoped to compass. That they might discredit Him before the Jews, they were determined to prove Him guilty of death before the Sanhedrin. That they might have their sentence executed, they desired to prove Him guilty of conspiracy against the Roman government. "On that night of terror, when all the enmity of man and the power of hell were unchained, even the falsehood of malevolence could not lay any crime to His charge, nor yet any accusation be brought against Him other than the misrepresentation of His symbolic Words. What testimony to Him this solitary false and ill-according witness!" — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 561.

4. To their unjust charges and false testimony our Lord did not reply. But when the high priest in judicial capacity employed the form of legal oath, Jesus responded.

5. "In these words Christ presented the reverse of the scene then taking place. He, the Lord of life and glory, would be seated at God's right hand. He would be the judge of all the earth, and from His decision there could be no appeal." — "Desire of Ages," chapter 75, page 707.

6. It was those who held Jesus in custody who maltreated Him (See Luke 22:63), the Sanhedrin not forbidding. He was not yet legally condemned. No sentence could be passed in the night. The night trial was informal, and a just tribunal would have forbidden the abuse and maltreatment of a criminal. But the Master bore it all silently, patiently — for us.

7. How many times men have habits to which they think they will never return. When Peter "followed Him afar off," he was in the devil's domain; and it was an easy thing to become again a rough, swearing man. We may see by this incident where grace found him. God wants, by His abundant grace to do for others all that He did for Peter.
