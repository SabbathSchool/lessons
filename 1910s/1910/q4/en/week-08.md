## Notes

1. The sixth hour mentioned by John (chapter 19:14) seems to be Roman time, or six o'clock in the morning. John wrote his Gospel many years later than the other evangelists. The sixth hour of Matthew was noon. The sun was darkened; nature was convulsed at the death of her Author. The heavens were clad in the garb of mourning, the darkness lasting from noon until 3 P.M. It was not an eclipse of the sun, for a total eclipse of the sun can not last at any place above four minutes, while this darkness lasted three hours. Hales's Chronology, volume 1, page 70, quotes from an old Roman document, written by Aurelius Cassiodorius Senator, about A.D. 514, as follows: "In the consulate of Tiberius Caesar Augustus V and Aelius Sejanus (u. C. 784, A.D. 31), our Lord Jesus Christ suffered on the 8th of the Calends of April (25th of March); when there happened such an eclipse of the sun as was never seen before nor since."

Hales continues: "In this year, and in this day, agree also the Council of Caesarea, A.D. 196, or 198; the Alexandrian Chronicle, Maximus Monadeus, Nicephorus Constantinus, Cedremus," and approved for this year though on a different date by Eusebius and Epiphanius, helper, Bucher, Petavius.

"This obscuration of the sun must have been preternatural, in its extent, duration, and opposition of the moon, at full, to the sun. It was observed at Heliopolis in Egypt, by Dionysius, the areopagite, afterwards the illustrious convert of Paul at Athens, Acts 17:34, who, in a letter to the martyr Polycarp, describes his own and his companion, the sophist Apollophanes' astonishment at the phenomenon, when they saw the darkness commence at the eastern limb of the sun, and proceed to the western, till the whole was eclipsed; and then regrade backwards, from the western to the eastern, till his light was fully restored; which they attributed to the miraculous passage of the moon across the sun's disk. Apollophanes exclaimed, as if divining the cause, 'These, O good Dionysius, are the vicissitudes of divine events!' Dionysius answered, 'Either the Deity suffers, or He sympathizes with the Sufferer!' And that Sufferer, according to tradition, record by Michael Syncellus, of Jerusalem, he declared to be 'the unknown God, for whose sufferings all nature was darkened and convulsed.'" — Hales's Chronology, volume 3, page 230.

2. These words marked the close of a period of agony, the climax of the Saviour's suffering. It was the sinner's Substitute, made sin for us, suffering in our stead, overwhelmed with the awful load of the world's iniquity. It seemed as though God had forever shut Himself away from the divine Sufferer; had forsaken Him in His last trial.

3. Our Lord's sayings upon the cross number seven, as follows: (1) "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do;" (2) "Verily, I say unto thee today, shalt thou be with Me in Paradise;" (3) "Woman, behold thy son!" "Behold thy mother!" (4) "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" (5) "I thirst;" (6) "It is finished;" (7) "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit."

4. When Jesus died, the graves were opened with the quaking of the earth. But those in the graves did not then arise. It was sin that had locked the graves of men; but Jesus died to save men from sin; hence the graves were opened. But the sleepers did not come forth from the dead till Christ the first-fruits arose.

5. "Sometimes there was added to the punishment of crucifixion that of breaking the bones by means of a club or hammer. This would not itself bring death; but the breaking of the bones was always followed by a coup de grace [a finishing stroke], by sword, lance, at stroke, which immediately put an end to what remained of life. Thus the 'breaking of the bones' was a sort of increase of punishment, by way of compensation for its shortening by the final stroke that followed." — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 613.
