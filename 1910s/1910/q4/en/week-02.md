## Notes

1. "As these words ['I am He'] were spoken, the angel who had lately ministered to Jesus, moved between Him and the mob. A divine light illuminated the Saviour's face, and a dove-like form overshadowed Him. In the presence of this divine glory, the murderous throng could not stand for a moment. They staggered back. Priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to the ground.

"The angel withdrew, and the light faded away. Jesus had opportunity to escape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed. As one glorified He stood in the midst of that hardened band, now prostrate and helpless at His feet. The disciples looked on, silent with wonder and awe." — "Desire of Ages," chapter 74, page 694.

2. In view of all that Judas had witnessed of Christ's miraculous power and ability to read hearts, it seems strange indeed that he should attempt thus to betray Him. His act shows the blinding, hardening power of sin, and how false teachers will come up to the very judgment bar of God and say, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works?" Yet Christ had never known them. They were workers of iniquity. Matt. 7:21-23.

3. "This is your hour, and the power of darkness." Recall Luke 4:13, A.R.V.: "When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him for a season." At that time Jesus was in the hands of the prince of darkness to be tempted as only the devil could tempt. Now in the close of His earthly ministry He is again in the hands of the power of darkness. His time has now come. Now He is "delivered up" to that awful period which ends only with His death and resurrection.

4. "A certain young man." The incident is related only by Mark, whose mother lived in Jerusalem. Acts 12:12. It has been conjectured that Mark was the "young man." "When the soldiers had come to seek Jesus in the upper chamber of his home, Mark, aroused from sleep, had hastily cast about him the loose linen garment or wrapper that lay by his bedside, and followed the armed band to see what would come of it. He now lingered in the rear, and followed as they led away Jesus, never imagining that they would attempt to lay hold on him, since he had not been with the disciples nor yet in the garden. But they, perhaps Jewish servants of the high priest, had noticed him. They attempted to lay hold on him, when, disengaging himself from their grasp, he left his upper garment in their hands, and fled." — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 545.

5. They took Him to Annas, the ex-high priest, who had been deposed by Valerius Gratus, and Joseph (Caiaphas), son-in-law to Annas, appointed in his stead. The Jews seemed still to recognize Annas as rightly holding the office.
