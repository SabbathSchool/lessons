## Notes

1. The first son was commended not because of his wicked reply, but because he repented. So the publicans, like Matthew and Zaccheus, who forsook their sins and followed Christ, would be saved; while the religious leaders, who, depending on their position and self-righteousness, rejected the blessed light, would be lost.

2. "This alludes to the Eastern custom, that if an owner was not to be found, and the occupier pays the taxes for six years, he can claim the property. The owner, in this case, was in a far country, and had sent servant after servant, but had not enforced his rights. When the legal heir appeared, they were alarmed for their tenure, and hoped that by killing him, unless his father came in person, the estate would become absolutely their own."— Canon Tristram. See John 11:48.

3. "In the parable the householder represented God, the vineyard the Jewish nation, and the hedge the divine law which was their protection. The tower was a symbol of the temple. . . . As the husbandmen had killed the servants whom the master sent to them for fruit, so the Jews had put to death the prophets whom God sent to call them to repentance. Messenger after messenger had been slain. . . . In the beloved son whom the lord of the vineyard finally sent to his disobedient servants, and whom they seized and slew, the priests and rulers saw a distinct picture of Jesus and His impending fate. Already they were planning to slay Him whom the Father had sent to them as a last appeal. In the retribution inflicted upon the ungrateful husbandmen was portrayed the doom of those who should put Christ to death."—"Desire of Ages," pages 596, 597.

4. The illustration is drawn from one of the stones prepared at the quarry for Solomon's temple, for which the builders at first found no place, being unacquainted with the head architect's plans, but which was later found to be the chief corner-stone on which the two walls met and were bonded together.

5. "'A sure foundation.' The entire world may lay upon it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With perfect safety they may build upon it. Christ is a 'tried stone.' Those who trust in Him, He never disappoints. He has borne every test. He has endured the pressure of Adam's guilt, and the guilt of his posterity, and has come off more than conqueror of the powers of evil. He has borne the burdens cast upon Him by every repenting sinner. In Christ the guilty heart has found relief. He is the sure foundation. All who make Him their dependence, rest in perfect security. . . . To those who believe, Christ is the sure foundation. These are they who fall upon the Rock and are broken. Submission to Christ and faith in Him are here represented. To fall upon the Rock and be broken is to give up our self-righteousness, and to go to Christ with the humility of a child, repenting of our transgressions, and believing in His forgiving love. And so also it is by faith and obedience that we build on Christ as our foundation."—"Desire of Ages," page 598, 599.
