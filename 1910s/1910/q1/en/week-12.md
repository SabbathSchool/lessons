## Notes

1. It is very probable from what follows that the man with the dropsy was not one of the guests. He may, with oriental freedom, have come in to look on, or he may have been placed there by envious design.

2. "The couches on which the guests reclined at meals were arranged so as to form three sides of a square, the fourth being left open to allow the servants to bring in the dishes. The right-hand couch was reckoned the highest; and the others, the middle and the lowest respectively, the places on each couch being distinguished in the same way, from the fact that the guest who reclined with his head, as it were, in the bosom of him behind, seemed to be the lower of the two. The 'highest place' on the highest couch was thus the 'chief place;' and human nature, the same in all ages, inevitably made it be eagerly coveted, while, as precedence was marked by nearness to it, there was an almost equal anxiety to get as close to it as possible. With the vanity and self-righteousness of a moribund caste, there was no little scheming among the rabbis for the best position, and much anxiety on the part of the host not to give offense; for to place a rabbi below any one not a rabbi, or below a fellow rabbi of lower standing, or younger, was an unpardonable affront, and a discredit to religion itself. The intolerable pride that had made one of their order, in the days of Alexander Janneus, seat himself between Alexander and his queen, on the ground that 'wisdom' made its scholars sit among princes, remained unchanged. Such petty ambition, so unworthy in public teachers of morals and religion and so entirely in contrast with His own instructions to His disciples, to seek no distinction but that of the deepest humility, did not fail to strike the Great Guest, who had calmly taken the place assigned Him." — Geikie: "Life and Words of Christ," Vol. 2, pages 319, 320.

3. "All the excuses betray a preoccupied mind. To these intended guests other interests had become all-absorbing. The invitation they had pledged themselves to accept was put aside, and the generous friend was insulted by their indifference." — "Christ's Object Lessons," page 222.

4. The parable was doubtless aimed at Jewish bigotry and exclusiveness, and was meant to help His disciples gain a new conception of the work which they must do for the Gentile world. It is a lesson for all time. When Satan can not prevent men from accepting Christ, He will endeavor to foster selfish pride and build up the feeling of caste within the church.
