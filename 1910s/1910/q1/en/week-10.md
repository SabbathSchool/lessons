## Notes

1. The Gospel is a Gospel of peace (Eph. 6:15), peace in the individual heart, and peace in society as far as its principles are received. But sin and righteousness are in deadly conflict; and those who accept the Gospel are often opposed by those who do not, just as Cain was opposed to Abel "because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous." 1 John 3:12.

2. "As Jesus talked with the disciples and the multitude, He looked forward with prophetic glance, and saw Jerusalem besieged with armies. He heard the tramp of the aliens marching against the chosen city, and saw the thousands upon thousands perishing in the siege. Many of the Jews were, like those Galileans, slain in the temple courts, in the very act of offering sacrifice. The calamities that had fallen upon individuals were warnings from God to a nation equally guilty. 'Except ye repent,' said Jesus, 'ye shall all likewise perish.' For a little time the day of probation lingered for them. There was still time for them to know the things that belonged to their peace." — "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 213, 214.

3. Edersheim makes some interesting comparisons of the narrative of the three Sabbath controversies: in Jerusalem, in Galilee, and in Perea.

"In all, the spirit was the same. And, although the differences between them may seem slight, they are characteristic, and mark, as if they pointed to it with the finger, the locality and circumstances in which each took place. In Jerusalem there is neither reasoning nor rebuke on the part of the Jews, but absolute persecution. There also the Lord enters on the higher exposition of His actions, motives, and mission. In Galilee there is questioning and cunning intrigue against Him on the part of the Judeans who dogged His steps. But while no violence can be attempted against Him, the people do not venture openly to take His part. But in Perea we are confronted by the clumsy zeal of a country archisynagogos (chief ruler of a synagogue), who is very angry, but not very wise; who admits Christ's healing power, and does not dare to attack Him directly, but, instead, rebukes, not Christ, not even the woman who had been healed, but the people who witnessed it, at the same time telling them to come for healing on other days, not perceiving, in his narrow-minded bigotry, what this admission implied. This rustic ruler had not the cunning, nor even the courage, of the Judean Pharisees in Galilee, whom the Lord had formerly convicted and silenced. Enough, to show this obscure Perean partizan of Pharisaism and the like of him their utter folly, and that by their own admissions. And presently, not only were His adversaries ashamed, while in Galilee they went out and held a council against Him, but the people were not afraid, as the Galileans had been in presence of their rulers, and openly rejoiced in the glorious working of the Christ" — Edersheim: "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," pages 223, 224.
