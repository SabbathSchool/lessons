## Notes

1. God's eternal purposes will be accomplished. Ps. 33:11; Isa. 46:10. Though the blighting curse of sin now rests upon the earth and its inhabitants, it is an immutable fact in God's purpose that sin is only a temporary intrusion and will be destroyed. Rev. 22:3. It is a thing of time and not of eternity. Thus the servants of sin abide not forever. Here is the divine law of the survival of the fittest.

2. It was the predicted and declared purpose of Jesus to free from sin those who would accept Him. Isa. 42:7; Matt. 1:21; Luke 4:18; 1 John 3:5. How slow we are to accept of the full provisions of the Gospel. But every one who stands before the Son of man at His coming must be wholly freed from the bondage of sin. Rev. 14:5. See "Early Writings," page 61 old edition, page 71 new edition.

3. The slanderous insinuations concerning the character of His birth (verses 19, 25), Jesus passed by apparently without notice, endeavoring all the while to impress His hearers with the truth of His unity with God, the unreasonableness of their opposition to Him, and their need of regeneration.

4. "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am." John 8:58, A.R.V. Jesus here states clearly His pre-existence. He was associated with the Father in the work of creation. Gen. 1:26. "All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made." John 1:3.

5. "Descent from Abraham was proved, not by name and lineage, but by likeness of character. So the apostolic succession rests not upon the transmission of ecclesiastical authority, but upon spiritual relationship. A life actuated by the apostles' spirit, the belief and teaching of the truth they taught; this is the true evidence of apostolic succession. This is what constitutes men the successors of the first teachers of the Gospel." — "Desire of Ages," page 467.
