## Notes

1. "The scenes of the past and the future were presented to the mind of Jesus. He beheld Lucifer as he was first cast out from the heavenly places. He looked forward to the scenes of His own agony, when before all the worlds the character of the deceiver should be unveiled. He heard the cry, 'It is finished,' announcing that the redemption of the lost race was forever made certain, that heaven was made eternally secure against the accusations, the deceptions, the pretensions, that Satan would instigate.

"Beyond the cross of Calvary, with its agony and shame, Jesus looked forward to the great final day, when the prince of the power of the air will meet his destruction in the earth so long marred by his rebellion. Jesus beheld the work of evil forever ended, and the peace of God filling heaven and earth." — "Desire of Ages," page 490.

2. The seventy returned, doubtless not all at one time, rejoicing in their success even to the casting out of devils. They were perhaps somewhat proud of doing what nine of Jesus' own apostles had once failed to do. Jesus rejoiced with them, and assured them of continual success, but warned them against self-confidence. There was cause for greater joy than this.

"There is a book of remembrance in the heavens, the Lamb's Book of Life, in which the names of all His true and faithful followers are written. It may be a great thing to have one's name inscribed in large, enduring letters in the roll of those who have done great things for Christ and for Christ's cause upon this earth; but that earthly register does not correspond with the one that is kept above. There are names to be found in the one that will not be met with in the other. There are names which shine bright in the one that appear but faintly luminous in the other. There are names that have never been entered in the one that beam forth with a heavenly brilliance in the other. The time comes when over the one the waters of oblivion shall pass, and its records be all wiped away. The time shall never come when the names that shall at last be found written in the other shall be blotted out." — Hanna: "The Life of Christ," page 410.

3. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. 1 Cor. 2:14. Those who trust in their own wisdom and prudence, can not understand God's truth.

"The only way in which we can gain a more perfect apprehension of truth is by keeping the heart tender and subdued by the Spirit of Christ. The soul must be cleansed from vanity and pride, and vacated of all that has held it in possession, and Christ must be enthroned within. Human science is too limited to comprehend the atonement. The plan of redemption is so far-reaching that philosophy can not explain it. It will ever remain a mystery that the most profound reasoning can not fathom. The science of salvation can not be explained; but it can be known by experience. Only he who sees his own sinfulness can discern the preciousness of the Saviour." — "Desire of Ages," pages 494, 495.

True science teaches us much of God, but can not fathom the plan of salvation, because of its limitations. God expects us to use our reasoning faculties; but they are limited, and must be supplemented by revelation. Revelation is not contrary to reason, but above it.

4. "Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest. The Lord says, Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in Thee. Our lives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves to the wise Master-worker, He will bring out the pattern of life and character that will be to His own glory. And that character which expresses the glory — character — of Christ, will be received into the Paradise of God. A renovated race shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy." — "Desire of Ages," page 331.

5. "Two pence," two denarii, about thirty-three cents, two days' wages, or enough for several days' care.

6. "Matters are placed on an entirely different basis from that of Judaism. The question now is not, 'Who is my neighbor?' but, 'Whose neighbor am I?' The Gospel answers the question of duty by pointing us to love. Wouldst thou know who is thy neighbor? Become a neighbor to all, by the utmost service thou canst do them in their need." — Edersheim: "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," page 239.
