## Notes

1. The grievance of the priests and Sadducees was twofold: first, because Peter and John "taught the people"• second, because they preached the resurrection of the dead. 'The first grievance was chiefly that of the priests, who were the au-thorized teachers of the people, and who denounced any man who ventured to teach without "having learned" in the rab-binical schools and received the proper credentials; for if this were allowed, their own influence would be in jeopardy. The second grievance was especially that of the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, though both priests and Sadducees were put to confusion by the undisputed resur-rection of Jesus, whom they had condemned and crucified.

2. This was evidently a formal gathering of the Sanhe-drin, before which Peter and John were brought for trial, and in the same place where Jesus had been tried.

3. In comparing these verses with the original prophecy in the second psalm, two differences will be noted: first, the changing of the verbs from present to past time, since the prophecy is regarded as fulfilled; second, the use of "Christ" instead of "anointed," these two words meaning the same thing.

4. It is worthy of note that this first recorded prayer of the church was most impressively answered.

5. The great harvest of souls on this occasion and on the day of Pentecost was not the result of merely the day's preaching. In reference to the work of Peter and John, we have this testimony: "Thus the disciples preached the resurrection of Christ. Many among those who listened were waiting for this testi-mony; and when they heard it, they believed. It brought to their minds the words that Christ had spoken, and they took their stand in the ranks of those who accepted the gospel. The seed that the Saviour had sown sprang up and bore fruit."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

60. In reference to the day of Pentecost: "During His life on this earth, He [Jesus] had sown the seed of truth, and had watered it with His blood. The con-versions that took place on the day of Pentecost were the result of this sowing, the harvest of Christ's work, revealing the power of His teaching."— Id., page

45. It is the privilege of every one to sow seed continually, so that when the Word is preached with power, there may re-sult a large ingathering of souls.

7. It must be borne in mind that while Peter and John had not received a rabbinical education, and were of the lay class rather than the priesthood, yet for three years they had been in the most wonderful school and under the greatest Teacher the world has ever known. There is no justification, in this passage, for our remaining in ignorance because the truth found us there; but there is evidence that God can signally use those who have little natural or cultivated ability, if they are consecrated to Him, yoke up with Christ in earnest study of His teachings, and open a repentant heart to the working of His Spirit.

8. The leaders of the church had _encountered serious ob-stacles in their work of witnessing for Jesus. They reported the circumstances to the company of believers, and they all "lifted up their voice to God with one accord," pleading His rulership over earth as well as heaven, and basing their en-treaty on the Word. They were heard immediately, and the response came with power.
