## Notes

1. David here voices beautifully the hope of every one who dies in the Lord. His flesh "shall rest in hope," because it was impossible that Jesus, the Life-giver, should be holden of death. He passed through the portals of the tomb, and "tasted death for every man." But He "arose triumphant" over the foe of all mankind, death; and "at the last trump," He will call forth the sleeping saints, who shall arise from their dusty beds "with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads," and "sorrow and sighing shall flee away."

4. By our lives, we are to witness that Jesus is not in the tomb, but is a living Saviour, and that by the ministry of His Spirit, He "always causeth us to triumph." We are to be so linked up with His power, that He "maketh manifest the savor of His knowledge by• us in every place"— by our life, our words, our faithful distribution of truth-filled writ-ings, our offerings, our children.

5. If we are not experiencing the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives, we are not living up to our high privileges; for the prom, ise is to "as many as the Lord our God shall call." We may obtain that power by the same means as did the disciples on the day of Pentecost.
