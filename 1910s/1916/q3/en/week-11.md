11. With Israel under_ the hard hand of the oppressor in Egypt, in the bondage of slavery, sunken in idolatry, with the knowledge of the true God all but lost, truly it would seem fitting to say that she was forsaken of God, an aban-doned vine in Egypt. But in that hour of "gross darkness," a deliverer was born, and God made good His promise never to leave or forsake His people. So it may be in our individual experience: we may pass through dark waters; but "when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him."
