3. The fulfillment of God's promises does not depend upon prospects. The value or reliability of any promise depends directly upon the ability of the maker to perform it; yet not upon this alone, for the maker may be able, but not faithful about keeping his promises. God is both able and willing, and is "not slack concerning His promises"; every promise of God is inspired by love. Study the circumstances of Abra-ham when God promised him "all the land" and "seed as the dust of the earth."
