## Notes

3. The Holy Spirit is the connecting link between heaven and earth. Through it life and power and truth are com-municated. It is by the Holy Spirit that the believer is to be "sealed unto the day of redemption." It therefore must not and cannot be trifled with. Men may deceive one another, but God looks upon and into the heart. The grieving away of the Holy Spirit brings spiritual and eternal death.

He an-swered, somewhat to my surprise, that what appealed to him. most in the personality of Jesus was His courage — the man-liness which could so quietly and dauntlessly face the hatred of so many of His fellow countrymen, the fierce enmity of the proud Pharisees, and above all, the certainty of death, and of the outward failure of His mission; the courage which undertook a work so constructive, the valor which could make. and could ask from others, such large sacrifices.' "—"Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," page

96. And what of the men who followed Jesus? Timid and weak at the outset, they became lionlike in their courage, as they went forward in the power of the Spirit to do the work that had been committed to them.
