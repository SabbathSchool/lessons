## Notes

3. We do not praise God enough. The story is told of a man's horses' becoming frightened as he was driving with his family to church. As the horses ran, the carriage wheels came within an inch of running off a high bridge. At church he arose and bore testimony of gratitude to God for deliver-ance. A brother then arose, saying he had still greater reason to be thankful, for his horses brought him quietly to the place of meeting.

4. "I. Faith performs the miracle (Peter and John). II. Faith experiences the miracle (the lame man). III. Faith comprehends the miracle (the believing hearers)."— Lange.
