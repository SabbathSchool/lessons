## Notes

1. "The early church was made up of many classes of people, of various nationalities. At the time of the outpour-ing of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, 'there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.' Among those of the Hebrew faith who were gath-ered at Jerusalem were some commonly known as Grecians, between whom and the Jews of Palestine there had long existed distrust and even antagonism."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

2. Up to this time, the apostles themselves had looked after the distribution of assistance to the needy. But the num-ber of believers had now increased to such extent that if the apostles continued to give personal attention to this work, it would virtually mean that they should "leave the word of God," and give all their time to business matters. This it did not seem right to them to do.

3. "These officers gave careful consideration to individual needs as well as to the general financial interests of the church; and by their prudent management and their godly example, they were an important aid to their fellow officers in binding together the various interests of the church into a united whole."— Id., page

4. "Learned Jews from the surrounding countries were summoned for the purpose of refuting the arguments of the prisoner. Saul of Tarsus was present, and took a leading part against Stephen. He brought the weight of eloquence and the logic of the rabbis to bear upon the case, to convince the people that Stephen was preaching delusive and dan-gerous doctrines; but in Stephen he met one who had a full understanding of the purpose of God in the spreading of the gospel to other nations. "Because the priests and rulers could not prevail against the clear, calm wisdom of Stephen, they determined to make an example of him; and while thus satisfying their revenge-ful hatred, they would prevent others, through fear, from adopting his belief."— Id., page

6. It is worthy of note that those who were to handle the finances of the church, should have three leading qualifica-tions: a reputation for honesty, practical wisdom, possession of the Holy Spirit. The business of the church can no more be done successfully without the aid of the Holy Spirit than can the preaching from the desk.

7. "Stephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man of deep piety and broad faith. Though a Jew by birth, he spoke the Greek language, and was familiar with the customs and manners of the Greeks. He therefore found opportunity to preach the gospel in the synagogues of the Greek Jews. He was very active in the cause of Christ, and boldly pro-claimed his faith. Learned rabbis and doctors of the law en-gaged in public discussion with him, confidently expecting an easy victory. But 'they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.' Not only did he speak in the power of the Holy Spirit, but it was plain that he was a student of the prophecies, and learned in all matters of the law. He ably defended the truths that he advocated, and utterly defeated his opponents."— Id., page
