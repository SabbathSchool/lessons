## Notes

25. If we bear in mind the meaning of his name, friend of God, lover of God, it may help us to receive Luke's testimony in the book of Acts as addressed to us personally as friends of God.

5. Unless the Christian is a witness for Christ in his own home, and among his neighbors, unless he takes part in the church missionary work in the community where he lives, it would be folly to send him across the continent to work for strangers, or into heathen lands, where the darkness is still denser, to teach and to preach the gospel. The true test of love and service for Christ is found in the life at home.
