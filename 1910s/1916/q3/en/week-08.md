## Notes

1. "Tell the birds amidst the bursts of spring not to sing; tell the waters welling from the depths not to flow; tell the happy child not to laugh and jump; tell sun and stars not to shine; and when these have obeyed you, then tell the soul which has been baptized with the love of God that it must not speak of Him, arid it will laugh you to scorn. It cannot but speak what it has seen and heard."

2. In the case of Peter and John, a direct issue was drawn between obedience to man and obedience to God. The council had charged them with threats "not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus." An angel of the Lord had said, "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." When arrested and brought again before the council, to account for their disobedience to its orders, Peter answered simply, "We ought to obey God rather than men," thus giving us a working principle for all time. So long as the commands of men in authority do not conflict with God's commands, the Christian obeys.

3. "In the history of prophets and apostles are many noble examples of loyalty to God. Christ's witnesses have endured imprisonment, torture, and death itself, rather than break God's commands. The record left by Peter and John is as heroic as any in the gospel dispensation. As they stood for the second time before the men who seemed bent on their destruction, no fear or hesitation could be discerned in their words or attitude."â€”"The Acts of the Apostles," page
