## Notes

1. "The government of Judea was then in the hands of Herod Agrippa, subject to Claudius, the Roman emperor. Herod also held the position of tetrarch, of Galilee. He was professedly a proselyte to the Jewish faith, and apparently very zealous in carrying out the ceremonies of the Jewish law. Desirous of obtaining the favor of the Jews, hoping thus to make secure his offices and honors, he proceeded to carry out their desires by persecuting the church of Christ, spoiling the houses and goods of the believers, and imprisoning the leading members of the church. He cast James, the brother of John, into prison, and sent an executioner to kill him with the sword, as another Herod had caused the prophet John to be beheaded. Seeing that the Jews were well pleased with these efforts, he imprisoned Peter also."â€”"The Acts of the Apostles," page

2. A quaternion was composed of four soldiers. Four quaternions would make sixteen. One quaternion was on duty at a time, the four being provided to cover the four watches of the day and night. The word "Easter" is a mistranslation. The Revised Ver-sion renders it "Passover."

7. Pray believing. Praying should not be merely the per-formance of a religious duty, or the means merely of easing the conscience or of attaining certain relief of mind. The Lord is pleased to have us pray believing that we shall receive what we ask for when we pray according to His will. While the believers at Mary's house were fasting and praying for Peter's deliverance, they evidently expected deliverance, for it came doubtless as an answer to their prayers. Yet they seemed hardly to expect it in the way it came; for when Peter appeared at the door delivered, they were "astonished" at the answer to their prayers, and could not believe the word of Rhoda till they saw Peter themselves. It is our part to pray believing, and let the Lord answer in His own way.
