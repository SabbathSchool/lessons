## Notes

1. "At one time, while Paul was telling the people of Christ's work as a healer of the sick and afflicted, he saw among his hearers a cripple, whose eyes were fastened on him, and who received and believed his words. Paul's heart went out in sympathy toward the afflicted man, in whom he discerned one who 'had faith to be healed.' In the presence of the idolatrous assembly, Paul commanded the cripple to stand upright on his feet. Heretofore the sufferer had been able to take a sitting posture only; but now, he instantly obeyed Paul's com-mand, and for the first time in his life stood on his feet. Strength came with this effort of faith, and he who had been a cripple 'leaped and walked.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

2. "The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men." Verse

11. "This statement was in harmony with a tradition of theirs that the gods occasionally visited the earth. Barnabas they called Jupiter, the father of gods, because of his venerable appearance, his dignified bearing, and the mildness and be-nevolence expressed in his countenance. Paul they believed to be Mercury, 'because he was the chief speaker,' earnest and active, and eloquent with words of warning and exhorta-tion."—Id., page

3. "In this dark and trying hour, the company of Lystrian believers, who through the ministry of Paul and Barnabas had been converted to the faith of Jesus, remained loyal and true. The unreasoning opposition and cruel persecution by their enemies served only to confirm the faith of these de-voted brethren; and now, in the face of danger and scorn, they showed their loyalty by gathering sorrowfully about the form of him whom they believed to be dead. "What was their surprise when, in the midst of their lamentations, the apostle suddenly lifted up his head, and rose to his feet, with the praise of God upon his lips. To the believers this unexpected restoration of God's servant was regarded as a miracle of divine power, and seemed to set the signet of Heaven upon their change of belief. They re-joiced with inexpressible gladness, and praised God with re-newed faith."— Id., page

5. In His miracles of healing, Jesus often said, "Accord-ing to thy faith be it unto thee," or words of similar import. Often, too, the power of the Spirit was so present with Him that He discerned the longing of the afflicted one to be healed, and took the first step toward healing him. Paul, in his ef-forts to have the darkened heathen mind comprehend Jesus, often rehearsed to the people His wonderful deeds of healing. Merely telling the story often called forth in his hearers, through the Spirit, faith and longing to be healed, as with the impotent man. Then through the Spirit, Paul discerned his state of mind, and ministered healing to him. Thus do faith and the Spirit work together upon the hearts of minister and hearer.

26. On the other hand, we may say, that we are men of like passions with the apostles and prophets. God was able to do mighty works through them because they maintained liv-ing communion with Heaven. God is as willing and ready to reveal Himself in and through us if only our lives are in harmony with His will.
