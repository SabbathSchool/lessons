## Notes

1. Saul had been a leader in the persecution that scattered the believers from Jerusalem. "Among the cities to which they went was Damascus, where the new faith gained many converts." ("The Acts of the Apostles," page

117. ) In the same book it is said that Saul spent the three days of blindness in "soul-agony," recalling with anguish his part in the martyrdom of Stephen and others, "shut away from all human sympathy," sensing that "his only hope of help was in a merciful God,", and that "to Him, he appealed in... brokenness of heart."

5. Saul was "fired with mistaken zeal" when he persecuted the church, but after he had a vision of Jesus as his only Saviour, and "yielded himself fully to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit," he became equally "zealous of good works." The Lord wants His people to work, to do good work, and to be zealous in its doing.

7. At the very time while Saul was praying in blind se-clusion, in brokenness of heart,â€¢with intense desire for pardon and acceptance, the Lord was preparing the answer through another.

8. "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution"- - that is, "suffer for My name's sake."
