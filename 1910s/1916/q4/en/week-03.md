1. What a marvelous change in the experience of Saul â€” from persecutor to preacher, from preacher to persecuted, from haling men and women into prison to being lain in wait for, from consenting to the death of Stephen to being watched for day and night to be killed! How soon did Saul the "chosen vessel" begin to "suffer for My name's sake"!

4. It is probable that these "saints which dwelt at Lydda" were the fruit of Philip's labor in his evangelistic tour up the coast. Peter would naturally follow up Philip's work as he did in Samaria.
