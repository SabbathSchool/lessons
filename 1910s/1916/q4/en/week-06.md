## Notes

1. Peter had foreseen that such a contention would be raised by those who were "of the circumcision" when they heard that he, like his Master, had consorted with "men uncircumcised," and had "eaten with publicans and sinners." For this reason, he took the precaution of taking with him to Cmsarea six of the Joppa brethren, whom he had evidently brought with him to Jerusalem as witnesses of the work done at the house of Cornelius. It is interesting to note how careful the leading apostles were to keep harmony between the field and the church at Jerusalem. After his experience at Damascus, Saul went up to Jerusalem "to see Peter" and to acquaint him and others with his work. Peter went back and forth from Jerusalem to various places where work was going on, and now, on this special occasion of extending the gospel to the gentiles, he goes up with witnesses and makes his report.

5. It is the Lord's plan to carry on His work through human agencies, and He therefore desires a spirit of harmony and unity to prevail among His workers. He sent Peter to Cor-nelius, and Philip to the eunuch, though angels were already on the ground and might have done the, work. He specially guided Philip, but led Peter down from Jerusalem to bind off his work. Saul went up to counsel with Peter. With such experiences as Saul and Peter had in being specially called of the Lord to lead out in giving the gospel to the gen-tiles, they, if any one, would seem justified in going their own way, without counsel. But here is Peter carrying out a de-liberate plan to maintain unity between workers and believ-ers. Those who profess nowadays a special call to lead off from the body into some way of their own, may well take heed to the lesson. God is not the author of confusion.

6. The power of the Spirit working with Peter among the gentiles, and accompanying, his rehearsal of this work to the church, broke down prejudices cherished by the Jews for cen-turies. Can we not depend on the same power to break down the strongest and most deep-seated prejudices, as we give the last message of warning to the world?

7. How many times we read in these chapters that the early apostles "preached Christ," or preached the Lord Jesus, or preached the Word, or similar expressions! Their preach-ing was simple and direct, and often resulted in many con-versions from a single sermon or in a single day. In these days of much learning, we may well beware of departing from the simplicity of Christ and of preaching Christ.
