## Notes

1. Observe how Paul, in making this declaration, appeals to both the Jews and the gentiles in his audience: "Children of the stock of Abraham" (Jews), and "whosoever among you feareth God" (including gentiles).

2. The result of formalism in worship is easily seen from this passage. The very prophecies which the Jews read or heard read "every Sabbath day" in their assemblies for wor-ship, they themselves became the instruments for fulfilling.

3. Here Paul turns to the cheering side of the picture, that God had fulfilled to the children His promise made to their fathers, "in that He bath raised up Jesus again:" To those who were listening to these burning words, there was still hope of salvation through the risen Christ.

5. "To you is the word of this salvation sent," declares Paul. It is easy to read the promises of God in an impersonal way, but it is far more helpful to receive them as addressed to us personally; for verily they are so addressed. We can never know their blessedness and their power till we apply and ap-propriate them to ourselves.

6. It is necessary to have form and order in our religious services. This implies a set time and a set place to hold them, and a more or less regular way of conducting them., Yet in this very uniformity lurks gredt danger. The Jews could read the prophecies of the Messiah with great regularity and faith-fulness for centuries, yet when it came up to the crisis, they "knew Him not, nor yet the voices [meaning] of the prophets!' We are secure from the same fatal result only as we find the words of God and eat them, as Jeremiah expresses it, and this, too, in our daily walk.
