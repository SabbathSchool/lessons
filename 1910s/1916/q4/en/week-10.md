## Notes

1. It may be recalled from last week's lesson that the Jews did not invite Paul and Barnabas to preach again the next Sabbath. This was the first step toward the open hostility that finally drove the apostles away from Antioch. The gen-tiles, however, warmed and cheered with the first preaching of Paul", desired to hear more of the word of God, and invited the apostles to speak again the following Sabbath. This was their first step-toward the larger blessing that awaited them in be-coming the special subjects of Paul's labor.

3. The response of the gentiles to their new privileges was very marked. They received the tidings with gladness; and joined with the apostles in publishing the word of the Lord "throughout all the region."

4. In this verse is the first use of the terms "Jews" and "Greeks," as distinguishing Jews and gentiles, which we shall find frequently hereafter, and which are often used through-out Paul's epistles.

5. Here is a marked instance of the division that Jesus said His coming and teaching would create, even to the dividing of members of the same family.

6. "The hearts of Paul and his associate workers were drawn out in behalf of those who were 'without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.' Through the untiring ministrations of the apostles to the gentiles, the 'strangers and foreigners,' who 'sometimes were far off,' learned that they had been 'made nigh by the blood of Christ,' and that through faith in His atoning sacri-fice, they might become 'fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.' "â€”"The Acts of the Apostles," page-

7. As we may come boldly to the throne of grace in our intercessions, that is, with courage and confidence born of faith, so would the Lord have us labor for Him, so can He manifest His power through us for the winning of souls.
