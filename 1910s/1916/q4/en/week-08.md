## Notes

2. "God had abundantly blessed the labors of Paul and Barnabas during the year they remained with the believers in Antioch. But neither of them had as yet been formally or-dained to the gospel ministry. They had now reached a point in their Christian experience when God was about to intrust them with the carrying forward of a difficult missionary en-terprise, in the prosecution of which they would need every advantage that could be obtained through the agency of the church."— Id., page

3. salamis was the chief city of Cyprus, situated on the eastern coast. Cyprus was a large island about eighty miles southwest of Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, the latter being the capital of Syria. We are now beginning to follow the labors of Paul on his first missionary journey.

4. Paphos was the capital city of Cyprus, on the west coast.

5. "The sorcerer had closed his eyes to the evidences of gospel truth; and the Lord, in righteous anger, caused his natural eyes to be closed, shutting out from him the light of day. This blindness was not permanent, but only for a season, that he might be warned to repent, and seek pardon of the God whom he had so grievously offended. The confusion into which he was thus brought, made of no effect his subtle arts against the doctrine of Christ. The fact that he was obliged to grope-about in blindness, proved to all that the miracles which the apostles had performed, and which Elymas had de-nounced as sleight of hand, were wrought by the power of God. The deputy, convinced of the truth of the doctrine taught by the apostles, accepted the gospel."— Id., page

6. "God has made His church on the earth a channel of light, and through it He communicates His purposes and His will. • He does not give, to one of His servants an experience inde-pendent of and contrary to the experience of the church itself. Neither does He give one man a knowledge of His will for the entire church, while the church — Christ's body — is left in darkness. In His providence, He places His servants in close connection with His church, in order that they may have less confidence in themselves, and greater confidence in others whom He is leading out to advance His work."— Id., page
