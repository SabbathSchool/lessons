## Notes

1. "As Peter entered the house of the gentile, Cornelius did not salute him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of Heaven, and sent to him, by God. It is an Eastern custom to bow before a prince or other high dignitary, and for children to bow before their parents; but Cornelius, overwhelmed with reverence for the one sent by God to teach him, fell at the apostle's feet, and worshiped him. Peter was horror-stricken, and he lifted the centurion up, saying, 'Stand up; I myself also am a man.' "-"The Acts of the Apostles," page

19. ) Peter is now about to preach the first Christian sermon to a gentile au-dience, the beginning of a distinctive world-wide movement. What wonder that he felt it a matter of expediency to take six Jewish brethren with him for witnesses!

3. Peter's first statement was as much a confession on his part as it was instruction to his hearers. The truth was as new to him as to those who listened. It had just been sent fresh from heaven, but it is still as fresh and forceful and applicable to-day as then.

4. The gathering at the house of Cornelius was really a "cottage meeting," for he had invited in his friends and rela-tives and neighbors to hear the message sent of God. The results were wonderful, and suggest that we "upon whom the ends of the world are come" ought to do far more of this kind of work.

9. How much respect of persons really lingers in the hearts of most of us! The picture drawn by James is not an ancient one alone. When we can look upon every man in the light of Calvary, we shall pay less attention to the artificial distinc-tions of society and pay due respect to all we meet. The mis-sionary who goes abroad should be "all things to all men," that he "may win some."
