## Notes

1. The "church" as an organized body of believers was a matter of development. The apostles had been calldd as leaders of the flock. Of the call of the twelve by Christ we are told: "The first step was now to be taken in the organiza-tion of the church that after Christ's departure was to be His representative on earth.... As in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs stand as representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles were to stand as representatives of the gospel church." ("The Desire of Ages," page

8. They have now borne their witness in Jerusalem, and been scattered by persecution "throughout the regions of Judea." In these parts they now go "everywhere preaching the Word."

3. "Christ's message to the Samaritan woman with whom He had talked at Jacob's well, had borne fruit." ("The Acts of the Apostles," page

106. ) In the carrying of the gospel into Samaria, the work of witnessing enters upon its third stage. Watch for the beginning of the fourth.

4. In the light of Paul's testimony to Timothy, it is fitting that we consider these two questions: Are we living "godly in Christ Jesus" to the fullness that we ought? Will it re-quire persecution to scatter *us abroad to preach the gospel everywhere as it must be preached before the end will come? Of the early church it is said, "To scatter His representatives abroad, where they could work for others, God permitted per-secution to come upon them." ("The Acts of the Apostles," page

5. The word "they" in this verse does not include the apostles. (See verse

1. ) It must therefore refer largely to the lay members of the church, and includes at least part of the deacons, of whom Philip was one. What a modern miracle it would seem for the entire church membership to go out and make a business of giving the gospel! Will such an ex-perience come to Seventh-day Adventists? How? When? Lesson

2. Lessons for Us

4. Rapid spread of the gospel when missionaries are Spirit-filled and Spirit-led. Note

1. Gaza was near the border of Palestine and Egypt. Ethiopia lay south of Egypt, in the region of modern Nubia and Abyssinia. Candace is said to be a common name for the queens of Ethiopa, as Pharaoh was a title for the kings of Egypt.

3. "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light, and who was ready to receive the gospel; and to-day angels will guide the footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and refine and ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to Philip could himself have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this is not God's way of working. It is His plan that men are to work for their fellow men."â€”"The Acts of the. Apostles," page

109. The Spirit directed Philip what to do when he met the eunuch, and where to go when his work for him was done.

4. Philip is spoken of in "The Acts of the Apostles" as a type of missionaries "who will hear the voice of God, and go where He sends them." (Page
