## Notes

1. "Cornelius was a Roman centurion. He was a man of wealth and noble birth, and his position was one of trust and honor. A heathen by birth, training, and education, through contact with the Jews he had gained a knowledge of God, and he worshiped Him with a true heart, showing the sincerity of his faith by compassion to the poor. He was known far.• and near for his beneficence, and his righteous life made him of good repute among both Jews and gentiles."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

2. "Though Cornelius believed the prophecies, and was look-ing for the Messiah to come, he had not a knowledge of the gospel as revealed in the life and death of Christ. He was not a member of the Jewish church, and would have been looked upon by the rabbis as a heathen and unclean. But the same Floly Watcher who said of Abraham, 'I know him,' knew Cornelius also, and sent a message direct from heaven to him."— Id., page

3. "It was not for physical food alone that Peter hungered. As from the housetop he viewed the city of Joppa and the surrounding country, he hungered for the salvation of his countrymen. He had an intense desire to point out to them from the Scriptures the prophecies relating to the sufferings and death of Christ."— Id., page

6. How often in the book of Acts so far has it been made evident that the Lord comes near to His children and reveals Himself to them in wisdom and power, when their hearts are bowed in humility and supplication at the. throne of grace! It is when the soul feels its helplessness and dependence most that God can fill the aching void with His presence.

8. That this experience was a severe test for Peter, with his strong Jewish training and prejudices, is evident from his conversation with the Lord, and from the fact tha, t the vision was presented three times, leaTing him still in doubt of its meaning. Yet he obeyed the voice of the Spirit in going to "keep company" with a gentile for perhaps the first time in his. life. But what a rich experience followed this act of obedience!
