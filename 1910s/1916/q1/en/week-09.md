## Notes

2. Mark the difference, in the parable, betWeen the prepara-tion of the foolish and that of the wise, for on this differ-ence turns the meaning of the whole parable: the foolish "took no oil"; the wise "took oil." All had lamps, and the lamps were all filled with oil to start with; but only half of the virgins provided against delay in the coming of the bridegroom. ottA. P tal
