## Notes

2. The disciples had been disturbed in mind by the words of Jesus while yet in the temple, "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate." It did not seem possible to them that so magnificent a structure as the temple would or could be made desolate. Therefore on going out of the temple, they called the attention of Jesus to the immense stones of the temple, so firmly and compactly put together that the wall ap-peared almost like solid rock. The great Nebuchadnezzar, with his war machines, had not been able to break down much of it, and all he did break down had been rebuilt. What catastrophe could bring desolation to it now? Then came Jesus' amazing answer.

3. Observe that the disciples asked Jesus two questions, or a double question:

1. "When shall these things be?" This question evidently referred to what He had said in the hearing of many about the throwing down of the temple walls.

39. These words, too, were fresh in the minds of the disciples, so they asked Jesus at the same time about the time of the throwing down of the temple walls, and about the sign of His coming and the end of the world, probably having it in mind that these three events would occur together. As the question was a double one, so also was the answer somewhat twofold, some passages referring to the destruction of Jerusalem only, some to both this and the last days, and some to the last days only.

3. "Christ's words were fulfilled. Between His death and the siege of Jerusalem, many false messiahs appeared."â€” "The Desire of Ages," page
