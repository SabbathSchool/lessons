## Notes

1. The Pharisees stood in no more friendly relation with the Sadducees than with the Herodians, but they could make common cause with them in seeking to entrap Jesus. His plain, pointed teaching had often rebuked bpth sects, and they sought to break His influence as a teacher, and to dis-prove His claim to being the Messiah, by entangling Him in His talk â€” by leading Him to say something upon which they could seize to condemn Him as an impostor. Disputes, too, often arose between these sects, and they sometimes carried these to Jesus, to secure His influence on one side or the other. They never came to Him for any purpose without receiving instruction, which, if heeded, would have worked salvation for them.

3. This is a very sweeping statement. Not only are the first four commandments based on love to God, and the last six on love to man; but all that the prophets wrote, and in fact all that Jesus taught and the New Testament writers wrote, was but the unfolding, in one way or another, of these two great principles.

2. What did He say concerning _the scribes and the Pharisees? Verse

9. What did they love in assemblies of the people? Verse

10. What other things did they love? Verse

11. What warning did Jesus give? For what reasons did He give it? Verse

12. Why should no one be called "our father" upon earth? Verse

13. Why are we not to be called masters? Verse

14. What rank will the greatest among Christ's fol-lowers occupy? Verse

1. Moses was a giver and interpreter of the law. The scribes and the Pharisees were successors to Moses, or pre-tended to be. As Jesus goes on to show, their sitting in Moses' seat was little more than a form.

2. In directing the people to observe and do what the Jewish teachers bade them, Jesus honored the office of "Moses' seat"; but from what follows, we must understand the ex-pression "all... whatsoever" to mean only that which was in harmony with Moses' law. The teaching and the practice of these interpreters of the law were so at variance that Jesus bade the people, in brief, to do what the teachers said, but not to do what the teachers did. This has an important ap-plication to-day. The inconsistent life of a minister or teacher excuses no one from observing what he teaches according to the Word. The vital thing for us is to receive the im-planted Word with meekness, and order our own lives accord-ingly, leaving the Lord to deal with the inconsistencies of the teacher.

4. The love of prominence, and the seeking of distinctive titles, is contrary to the spirit of the gospel. Much greater is the honor of being simply a servant of God, as the New Testament writers often call themselves.
