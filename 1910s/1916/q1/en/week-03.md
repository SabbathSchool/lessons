## Notes

2. Jesus does not condemn the zeal of the scribes and the Pharisees in making proselytes, that is, worshipers, or con-verts. Paul was a Pharisee of the most zealous type. When converted, his zeal never flagged, carrying him to all parts of the known world, through much peril and suffering, to win souls to Christ. Jesus Himself traveled to and fro from Bethany to Sidon, and from beyond Jordan to the coast, seeking and saving the lost. It was the hypocritical example and influence of the Pharisees over converts that Jesus condemned.

3. The avarice of the Pharisees is made plain in this twofold denunciation. The gold of the temple and the gift on the altar had commercial value. Taking advantage of religious scruples for gain is one of the most wicked methods of the hypocrite. Jesus encountered it on the occasion when He drove the money changers and the stock dealers from the temple.

4. Jesus does not here denounce scrupulous painstaking to tithe the smallest income, as is shown by the next expression. We cannot be too particular to render to God every whit that belongs to Him as the special portion of our income that He has asked. Our failure is, rather, to grow careless in this mat-ter. But along with this, Jesus would have us heedful of things of greater moment as affecting the building of char-acter â€” the exercising of the Christlike qualities of impartial judgment, of plenteous mercy, and of faith that works by love.

5. The Revised Version states it thud: "Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel!"
