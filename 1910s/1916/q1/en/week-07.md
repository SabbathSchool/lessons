3. "The sins that called for vengeance upon the antedilu-vian world exist to-day. The fear of God is banished from the hearts of men, and His law is treated with indifference and contempt. The intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the generation now living.... God did not condemn the antediluvians for eating and drinking; He had given them the fruits of the earth in great abundance to supply their physical wants. The sin consisted in taking these gifts without gratitude to the Giver, and debasing them-selves by indulging appetite without restraint. It was lawful for them to marry. Marriage was in God's order; it was one of the first institutions which He established. He gave special directions concerning this ordinance, clothing it with sanctity and beauty; but these directions were forgotten, and marriage was perverted, and made to minister to passion. A similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful in itself is carried to excess."â€”"Patriarchs and Prophets," page
