## Notes

1. A more modern expression for "whited sepulchers" would be "whitewashed tombs." According to the cere-monial law, those who had touched anything belonging to the dead were unclean. The Jews kept their tombs white-washed, that they might be easily seen and avoided. It served also to give them a pleasant outward appearance. These tombs were a fitting symbol of persons wearing their religion on the outside to conceal inner guilt.

3. "By prophets, wise men, and scribes, our Lord intends the evangelists, apostles, deacons, etc., who should be em-ployed in proclaiming the gospel; men who should equal the ancient prophets, their wise men and scribes, in all the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit."â€” Clarke.

4. The Jews of Christ's time were the more guilty because they had a knowledge of what their fathers had done, and condemned it, yet centered upon themselves the guilt of all the blood of righteous men that had been shed from Abel down, by taking the life of the sinless Son of God.
