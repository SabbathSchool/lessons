## Notes

7. "I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful, and were looking to the time of 'refreshing' and the `latter rain' to fit them to stand in the day of the Lord, and to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the time of trouble [after the sudden coming of Jesus out of the heav-enly sanctuary] without a shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation, therefore they could not receive the re-freshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of a holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets, and fail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth, and who are willing to believe that their condition is far better than it really is, will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. But there will be no time then to do it, and no Mediator to plead their cause before the•Father." —"Early Writings," page
