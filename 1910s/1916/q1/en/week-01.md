## Notes

1. "The Herodians were a political party rather than a religious sect. They were the partisans of the Idumean dynasty, which, springing from heathenism, remained, in taste, inclination, barbarity, and licentiousness, heathen still, though from state policy they outwardly conformed to the Jewish ritual observances."â€”"Oxford Helps to Bible Study."

3. The use of this text by Jesus to prove the resurrection of the dead is an indication of the depth of meaning and far-reaching application of some scriptures which are entirely overlooked by the ordinary mind. The argument runs thus: Many years after the death of these three patriarchs, the Lord said to Moses, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." The statement of Jesus, in His use of this scripture, "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living," instead of proving that these patriarchs were then living in heaven, indicates that they were then dead, but that a resurrection would be necessary in order that they might be living again. Here is definite proof that those who are in their graves are not regarded as living.
