## Notes

1. The expression "He sat down" reads literally, in the original, "He was reclining," that is, at table, according to the customs of the times to recline on couches while eating. The Revised Version reads, "He was sitting at meat," which gives the true idea.

4. "Christ was standing at the point of transition between two economies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb of God, was about to present Himself as a sin offering, and He would thus bring to an end the system of types and ceremonies that for four thousand years had pointed to His death. As He ate the Passover with His disciples, He insti-tuted in its place the service that was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice. The national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service which Christ established was to be observed by His followers in all lands and through all ages."â€”"The Desire of Ages," page
