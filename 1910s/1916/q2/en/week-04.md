## Notes

1. Over the dark Kidron passed David in sorrow and agony in his flight from Jerusalem a thousand years before; over the Kidron to His awful agony for a lost world passed David's Son, the promised Seed. Gethsemane was an inclosure at the foot of the Mount of Olives. Here our Lord was accustomed to go with His disciples for prayer and instruction. Little did they realize the meaning of this last journey across the historic brook.

2. The humanity of our Lord shrank from the awful agony before Him; not the physical suffering alone; not the mock-ing, the shame, the anguish; but from the awful sense of sin which hid the Father's face, and weiglied upon the Son of man like the agony of a lost soul. No wonder He prayed that if possible the cup be removed. God did not condemn Him for that. He does not condemn us when. we, in human weak-ness, pray for deliverance from some. awful trial. God pities and loves us still; "for He knoweth our frame; He remem-bereth that we are dust." He loved not less His Son in dark Gethsemane than on the shining mount of transfiguration.

3. The angel could not lessen the load, could not take the burden upon the Saviour's heart, could not bear the cross, though he would willingly have done so; but he brought strengthening grace and cheer from the throne. Even so with us. For our own good, there may be burdens, heavy to bear, laid upon us, that we may draw needed strength from the infinite Source.
