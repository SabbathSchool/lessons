## Notes

3. The Master was not seized because He could not escape. More than once during His ministry, He "passed out of the midst" of those 'who would do Him violence. He did not need any physical protection by His disciples; for if it were necessary, or in keeping with the occasion, He could receive from the Father more than twelve legions of angels for His deliverance. But His hour had come, and He suffered Him-self to be taken. It was a completely voluntary act on' His part.

4. Jesus knew how severe a test it would be to His dis-ciples to see their Master seized and taken away by His murderers. It was for this reason He had bidden them watch and pray that last night in Gethsemane, lest they enter into temptation. Always thus mindful of others, He re-quested that the disciples be permitted to depart.
