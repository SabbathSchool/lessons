## Notes

2. A stupid and self-contradictory lie. Who of the dis-ciples would have dared attempt to break the Roman seal, roll away the stone, and steal the body of Jesus, with an armed guard set to watch against this very thing? If the guard had fallen asleep, would not the removal of the body have waked them? Or if it had not waked them, how would they know who did it?

3. By reporting that they fell asleep on guard duty, the soldiers would proclaim their own death warrant, for the Roman punishment for sleeping on guard was death. There-fore the priests promised to "persuade" the governor — with money, of course — thus using a corrupt disciple, corrupt soldiery, and a corrupt governor to accomplish their wicked end.

29. ] Sud-denly Jesus stood among them. No one could tell whence or how He came. Many who were present had never before seen Him; but in His hands and feet they beheld the marks of the crucifixion; His countenance was as the face of God, and when they saw Him, they worshiped Him. "But some doubted. So it will always be. There are those who find it hard to exercise faith, and they place themselves on the doubting side. These lose much because of their un-belief."—"The Desire of Ages," page

5. The Revised Version reads, more exactly, "All authority hath been given unto Me." Satan had questioned in heaven the authority, or right of Jesus to participation in the counsels of the Father to the exclusion of himself. He had usurped the dominion of man over the earth, and offered it to Jesus as one of the temptations in the wilderness. But "when he saw Christ come forth in triumph [from the tomb], he knew that his kingdom would have an end." ("The Desire of Ages," page

782. ) By His incarnation, death, and resurrection, Jesus had won undisputed authority in heaven and upon earth. He therefore had full right to send forth His representatives to win back His alienated subjects to His kingdom. His au-thority was doubtless fully conferred on Him at the time of His acceptance by the Father, when He ascended for this purpose immediately after the resurrection.
