## Notes

1. Matthew's wonderful record of the teachings and mira-cles of Jesus is largely closed with chapter

25. The remaining four chapters narrate the events connected with the betrayal, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, closing with the great world commission to His disciples. The words of Jesus at the opening of our lesson are filled with sublime pathos, fore-shadowing as they did the solemn events then near at hand.

3. At this feast, there sat with Jesus both Simon, the healed leper, and Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. Then Mary also, who had been cleansed of seven devils, and had been led into sin by this same Simon the leper, was there to pour out her soul in deep gratitude for the forgive-ness of sins,â€¢as symbolized by the precious ointment she used. Simon, too, repented on this occasion, and obtained forgive-ness. Wonderful gathering of objects of Jesus' mercy at this His last visit to Bethany!
