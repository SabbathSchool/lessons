## Notes

1. Here is definite, convincing testimony that the original Sabbath of the fourth commandment was still observed by the disciples of Christ.

2. Some have difficulty with the expression "in the end of the Sabbath," or "late on the Sabbath day," as given in both the English and the American Revised Version. In nar-rating the same event, Mark says, "when the Sabbath was past"; Luke, "upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning"; John, "the first day of the week... early, when it was yet dark." Matthew's phrase may be rendered, with authority of scholarship equal to any other, "after the Sabbath."

3. In the words of the angel, "as He said," there is a gentle reproof to the women and the twelve disciples, who seem to have forgotten, in their sorrow, that Jesus had said repeatedly He should rise again the third day; while the chief priests and the Pharisees, in their restless anxiety on the Sabbath, remembered His prediction.
