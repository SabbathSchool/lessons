## Notes

2. There are several things which show that the repent-ance of Judas was not of the genuine kind that brings re-mission of sins:

2. If the repentance had been of the right kind, he would not have taken his own life.

3. The word "repented" used here is not the usual one for repent-ance of sin, but rather denotes a growing anxious over a thing after it is done, and could very properly be rendered here "filled with regret or remorse."

64. It is equivalent to an af-firmative answer. Jesus could not deny that He was the Son of God or King of the Jews.

5. "Pilate expected an answer. He knew the substantial falsehood of both charges, but he would have them met by a reference to well-known facts, that he might have osten-sible grounds for requittal, which from first to last it was evidently his wish to pronounce. But our Lord was silent." â€” Dean Mansel.
