## Notes

4. His death was for us, in our behalf. Baptism shows faith in His death to save us from the sin which causes death.

3. "With Him."— Faith grasps His death for our death, His burial in consequence of sin, for our burial of the old man of sin. We are to reckon the buried man dead.

4. Even so by that same power we should walk in newness of life.

5. "We shall be also."— Planted in the likeness of Christ's death — dying to sin — we may know that the resurrection of life shall be ours. • Every true baptism in Christ becomes there-fore a pledge of the resurrection to • life, and is to the world the beginning of a life that witnesses to the power of Christ.

6. "The body of sin."— The body of sin is equivalent to, or essentially connected with, the old man. It is the essential sin-fulness of human nature, that which clings like a clog, which binds like a chain, which imprisons the sinner like stone walls and iron bars, unless it is yielded to God, unless it is counted crucified with Christ, and buried forever.

7. "Death hath no more dominion."— It is well for us ever to bear in mind why it is that death has no more dominion. When Jesus died, He died for our sins. He lives by the virtue of righteousness. That righteousness is everlasting; so also is the life. Nor can death hold dominion long over those who are clothed in the righteousness wrought by Christ. S. "Reckon."—Christ died for you; "reckon" His death yours. Set it to your account. Count yourself as dying upon the cross, and the old man of sin buried forever. Jesus was raised from the dead for your justification; "reckon" His life yours, and by the power of that endless life triumph over sin.
