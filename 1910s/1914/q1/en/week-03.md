16. Unto what is the life-ordained commandment found to be? 

17. What experience is in harmony with the apostle's last statement? 

18. But what does this slaying of sin prove the law to be? 

## Notes

1. "Dominion over a man."— This is a common, clear il-lustration. No law, human or divine, holds the dead responsible. Only while man lives is he amenable to law and responsible to his government.

2. "Is bound by the law."— The law binds the woman to her husband only as long as he lives. If he dies, she is released. lt is not the design of the law to' bind the living to the dead.

3. As the mind was in harmony with the passions, the passions of course controlled us, brought us into bondage, and we brought forth fruit unto death.

5. "Delivered."— How'l — By dying to sin. By counting the old man with the carnal mind crucified on the cross. Read the text as given in the margin,—"being dead to that wherein we were held," that is, dead to the transgression of the law, under the bondage of which the violated law held us. The Revised Version reads, "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held." Rotherham renders the text, "But now we have received full release from the law, by dying in that wherein we used to be held fast."
