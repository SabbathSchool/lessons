## Notes

1. "First-born."— Christ is the First-born in God's purpose in time; He is the First-born in preeminence, the One who holds preeminent character, and by whose power and grace all others are redeemed. To predestinate is to mark out beforehand.

3. "That justifieth."— Meditate upon these great and won-derful assurances of God's love. He, He, the Infinite One, is the only Heing in all the universe, who could a charge against us which would hold, because our sin is against Him; but the only One who can lay aught against us is the One who justifies. It is as though we were going before the judge for sentence, knowing we were guilty, and knowing that he knew we were; and then to hear him say, in place of pronouncing sentence, "You are free; your trans-gression is forgiven."

2. How does he express his feelings? Verse

3. How great was his burden of heart for his breth-ren? Verse

13. What is comprehended in the "service" of God? - The life of obedience, and worship in harmony with the word of God.

1. "Heaviness and... sorrow."— He who accepts Jesus Christ and His service must not seek a bed of roses, or a time of idle joy or selfish ease. He will lose his burden of sin; that will roll off at the foot of the cross; but if he has the Spirit of Christ, he will be burdened and heavy of heart oftentimes for others. He will know the night seasons of prayers and tears; he will meet the mounts of temptation and the gardens of Gethsemane. That soul who is not burdened for others has never found full fellowship with Christ.

2. "I could wish that myself were accursed."— That is, if his eternal loss would but save those he loved, be would be will-ing to make the sacrifice,— not a mere temporary one, but an eternal giving up of all things for the salvation of his people. "Accursed" is more literally "anathema," or as in the Old Tes-tament, "devoted," doomed to die. It was the spirit which ac-tuated our Lord, and which was manifest in Moses.

30. But they were descendants according to the flesh. "Israel" meant character when given to Jacob; it was a mere name of a people with most of his children. Even so it is now with the name "Christian."

6. "The covenants."— A covenant based upon human prom-ises, a new covenant based upon God's promises. The first ought to have taught them humility, and that personal righteousness can not come through a national covenant. The new covenant — the everlasting covenant — is based on the promises of God in Jesus Christ.

7. On what word is the promise of the seed based? Verse

8. Did the hope rest upon any decree or planning of man, or upon the word alone? Verse

12. How is the righteousness of this choice stated? ' Verse

13. What did God declare to Moses? Verse

14. With whom then does the issue rest? Verse

17. To what conclusion then does the apostle come? Verse

1. "Not all Israel."— Keep the distinction in mind. There is Israel according to the flesh, the carnal descendants of Jacob. There is also the true Israel, who like Jacob wrestled earnestly with the Angel. They are not all true Israel that are of Israel according to the flesh. As we might say, They are not all Chris-tians who are so called.

31. The children of promise are we if by faith we embrace it. Behind it is all the power of God for Victory.

4. "The word."— In the case of Sarah, God wrought a mir-acle. So He does in regenerating every soul of man.

5. "According to election."— God's purpose must stand; and to carry out that purpose, He uses sometimes to us strange means. Sometimes He uses men for these purposes, regardless of character. His use of them does not even imply their salvation. Nor does His rejection of others, or His refusal to use them for a definite purpose, mean to them loss of salvation. The election of Jacob for the channel of the holy Seed did not, mean the utter rejection of Esau. The choice of Judah •for the same purpose did not mean the loss of salvation by his brothers. Election to eternal character and life involves our choice as well. Not that it is not according to God's purpose, but every soul may choose or reject the purpose of God.

6. "That I might show My power."— That God might show His power in Pharaoh; that God's name might be declared throughout the earth. Now "God is no respecter of persons." He longs to save all men. "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

3. Pharaoh rejected God's plan for him, but God's purpose was carried out just the same, to Pharaoh's eternal loss, when it might have been to his eternal gain. God chose Pharaoh for this special twofold purpose, irrespective of character. In it Pharaoh might have found the higher choosing.
