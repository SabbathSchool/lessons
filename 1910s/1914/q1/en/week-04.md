## Notes

10. In the sinful heart, it became the law of sin and death, condemning the sin, and the sinner identified with the sin. Then, too, the perverted, sinful mind perverts the law, and the soul has no true standard. But in Christ, the perfection of the law was wrought out, and God places that perfection of righteousness to the account of the be-lieving sinner, and the power of that perfect life sets him free.

3. "The law could not do."— Law can never free its trans-gressor, however much he may strive to meet its claim. The sin-weakened flesh can not make perfect a sinful past, however it may strive; and because sinful, it can never do even present duty. Sin leaves the sinner absolutely without hope in himself. -

6. "In us."— The apostle defines who is meant by the pro-noun "us." It is those who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. This is a clear evidence that the Spirit leads in har-mony with the righteousness of the law.

7. "Carnally minded."— Or, "the minding of the flesh," margin. This means a mind dominated by the flesh, in harmony with it. The flesh is in control, lording it over the mind.
