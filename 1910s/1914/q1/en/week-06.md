## Notes

1. "Of the creature."— The Revised Version gives "the cre-ation," and so throughout this lesson. The material creation as a whole, as will appear as our study proceeds, is groaning under the curse. When sin entered the universe of God, it was a charge against God's government, God's ways of working, God's good-ness and love. It was a challenge to His wisdom and power. However localized was sin's entrance, or direct in its operation, in the very nature of the case it affected the whole creation; for God's work is one, bound together in the bundle of the one life, and the sin was against the one God, creation's Author. It is eminently fitting, therefore, to represent the whole creation itself, insensate though we regard it, as longing for deliverance from sin.

2. "The manifestation."— The Revised Version reads, "The revealing." "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be-stowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: there-fore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it cloth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is."

43. For this glorious manifestation creation waits.

4. "Because the creation itself."— The hope is that when God's work of redemption of man is finished, all God's universe will be restored. When sin is forever blotted out, the creation, marred not of its own will, shall be delivered from the bondage of all corruption, all imperfection, into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God. Then the challenged power and wisdom of the Creator will brir; the hope to fruition.

21. The Spirit of God has brought them into sympathetic touch with all God's pur-poses. The first-fruits of the Spirit are God's earnest, or pledge, that the groans and travail are not in vain.
