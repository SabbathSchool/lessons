## Notes

10. We are not then under the law, or over the law, but with the law in Christ.

3. "God be thanked."— The thought is not that Paul thanks God that the Roman brethren were sinners, but that although they were once slaves of sin, they obeyed God and yielded to His truth. •

4. "Wages of sin."— The apostle's word is clear and ex-plicit. The wages of sin, the sure result of sin's sowing, is death, a cessation of existence. How the infinite wisdom and justice of God is shown in this! In His perfect plan, sin can not be forever perpetuated,= it meets its sure end in its own fruitage, and he who chooses sin chooses its wages, death. Surely God is just in depriving man of life which he misuses.
