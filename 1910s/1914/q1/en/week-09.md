## Notes

3. "Even us."— Every saved soul among Jews and Gentiles was a demonstration of God's mercy toward all; for He "is no respecter of persons," and everyman will be left without excuse. •

5. "Ye are not My people."— The book of Acts and the epistles of Paul are records of the transforming power of God's mercy, and so •has been the history of Christianity from that day to this. From sin to righteousness, from darkness to light, from vice to virtue, from death to life, from paganism, with all its sins, to Christianity, with all its graces such has been the transform-ing power of His mercy and grace. In lands of the greatest dark-ness, where righteousness has been unknown, there the Word has begotten "children of the living God."

7. "Finish the work."— Yet God will finish His work. Man's unbelief and hardness of heart will not frustrate God's work forever. Sometime it will close quickly, and that day draws on apace.
