## Notes

28. This is a life, a power, that the unbeliever neither knows nor possesses. It is the only power which enables us to overcome sin.

4. "Quicken your mortal bodies."— Better as given in the Revised Version, "give life also to your mortal bodies." The text embraces the present. It is true that God will raise from the dead His trusting people and give them immortality when Jesus comes. The mortal bodies will be made immortal. But it is also a blessed truth that by His Spirit He now gives life,— strengthening, cleansing, healing life.

5. "Not debtors."— How many there are — Christians though they profess to be— who seem to say, by their every-day walk and words, that they owe something to the world and to the flesh, to worldly aims, objects, and customs; that these fleshly things must be indulged. Let us thank God that we are not debtors to the flesh. We have been redeemed by an infinite price. We be-long to Christ. To Him we owe all. The flesh of sin is a hard, tyrannical master, whose service ends in death. But Christ has purchased and called us to glorious freedom.,

8. "Ye are My friends," says our blessed Lord, "if ye do whatsoever I command you." God's Spirit will ever lead to obedience.

7. "Not the spirit of bondage."— Not the spirit we had under the slavery of sin. That is slavish fear under a cruel master. Godly fear is the loving reverence of a child for an infinite and loving Father. The first is a fear of punishment of sins yet retained; the other is a fear lest we do wrong to One who is our only Saviour and Hope.
