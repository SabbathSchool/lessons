14. "— Interpreting Bible.

2. "Maketh intercession."— Not as a, person apart from us, hut within us; "by begetting in us those feelings of the evil of sin, and desires after holiness and glory, that no language can express; even as severe disease can not be described in words, hut becomes perfectly intelligible to the tender-hearted from the groanings of the sufferers."— Interpreting Bible. "The Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we, mself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utter-ance in sighings and aspirations."— Alford.

3. "According to the will of God."—" The very Spirit who thus pleads, does it according to God,— in pursuance of the di-vine purposes and in conformity with God's good pleasure. All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered."— Alford.

7. (Read also Psalm

5. "Nevertheless."— This word expresses the submission of Jesus to His Father's will. His prayer expresses His human fears and desire, "Let this cup pass." He expresses His love and con-fidence in "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee; " but the supreme petition is that not His will but God's will be done. Such a prayer can never be unanswered.

7. "All things."— We see but the human side of God's work-ing, the wrong side of the web, like the tapestry weavers; and it looks to us, in our limited view, seeing but one stripe and color of experience at once, that it is so imperfect. Like the tapestry weavers, we must keep our eyes on the beautiful pattern over-head, and leave all our doubts till the great web is unrolled. Read the text, "And we know that to them that love God, God worketh all things with them for good." See margin of Revised Version. That is, it is not by a happy, fortuitous combination of things that good comes, but God actively, positively works them all for our good. The good Father will make even the most forbidding thing bring good to His child.
