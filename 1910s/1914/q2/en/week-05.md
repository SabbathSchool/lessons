## Notes

2. "Kindly affectioned."— The word in the original is that used for affection toward near relatives. Alford renders the text, ": In love of the brethren be affectionate one to another; in giving honor, outdoing one another." ''Not waiting to be loved by another, but thyself spring forward to the act, and make the be-ginning."

3. "Not slothful."—"In diligence, not slothful."— Alford. It pertains first of all to the Lord's business; and yet all the Christian's business ought to be the Lord's business. Whether it be raising corn, or building houses or keeping books, he should be doing all for God, under whose all-searching ' eye all work must come at last. We can not do God's business for Him and ours for ourselves; all should be for God. How can we understand other-wise "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with-all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength"? But how far short we come! We will find when we plan for God, He will plan for us. '

4. . "Given to hospitality."— Alford says, "This is but a feeble rendering of the original, which is pursuing, making ear-nestly a point of hospitality." Chrysostom says, "He does not say practising, but pursuing, teaching us not to wait for those that are in need, but rather to run after them and track them out."
