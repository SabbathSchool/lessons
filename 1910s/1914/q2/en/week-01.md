## Notes

4. Faith in Christ, we have learned, establishes the law in the heart.

4. Righteousness by faith is personified and made to speak for itself. It does not demand that man shall do great things by which he will take glory to himself. Man is not to descend into the deep, nor must he climb up to heaven; all he needs to do is to yield himself, and believe in Christ Jesus, who has come down to him. Thus it was in the days of Moses. They did not need to climb up to the serpent, but "look and live." Thus it is now. Jesus the Lord, the Saviour, has come down to us. Open the heart, and let faith see Him there. And it is all in the word which faith brings, with its cleansing power, within the heart.

5. "Unto righteousness."— There is much belief which merely accepts facts and no more. Faith accepts righteousness, reaches to it, makes it its own. The faith which stops short of righteousness is a failure.

4. Sometimes He speaks in dread majesty, sometimes in marvelous wisdom, sometimes in the terrible tempest, in the soft-breathing night breezes, in the mighty oak, in the tiny floweret, in all the wonders of the jeweled dome above us. In a thousand different ways is proclaimed to the thoughtful, longing heart the power, the wisdom, and the love of God. There has always been light enough to lead to God, and there is sufficient potency in one ray to save the soul who receives and follows the light.
