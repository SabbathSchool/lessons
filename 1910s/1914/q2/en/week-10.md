## Notes

1. "Another man's f oundation."— Paul wanted proof from God for his own labors. He did not care or dare to speak of others' work, but only of his own. Verse

11. Much of the suc-cess of many evangelists is in building on the foundation laid by devoted souls who have preceded them. Nearly all apostates who have "greater light" tarry around churches, endeavoring to split them, instead of working, and teaching the new theories which they hold as light, in the new fields.

3. "Debtors they are."— The world looks upon the spiritual blessings lightly, upon the temporal as of far greater value. Yet the temporal things perish with the using, the spiritual things are eternal. Would that God's gifts might be better and more strongly appreciated. We would then see that even our temporal things are increased by them.
