## Notes

1. "Cenchrea" was the eastern part of Corinth, about nine miles distant. It seems to have been a town of considerable im-portance in thd apostle's day. It is now known as Kichries. Phebe was a servant, or deaconess, at Cenchrea, and may well have been the bearer of this epistle. Pliny, in his letter to the emperor Trajan, speaks of two Christian handmaids whom he tortured, and whom he declares were called ministree, or deaconesses.

3. EpEenetus, according to the Revised Version, was of Asia instead of Achaia. We know naught of these persons only as they are here mentioned by the apostle. It was good to know that Paul had relatives in Rome, who accepted the truth before he did, consequently were known to the apostles. Junia was prob-ably the wife of Andronicus.

30. But all God's unknown workers are recorded on high. The mention of these shows how Paul re-garded individually his personal helpers.

5. Rome was then the center of the world. All information went out more readily from Rome to all parts of the empire than from any other, center. Churches elsewhere became greatly in-terested in the believers who were under the shadow of the palace of the Cmsars. The apostle did not wish them to be wise in wick-edness, but to know naught of it. We do not need to study counterfeits to know the genuine, but we do need to know the genuine that we may discern at once the counterfeit.
