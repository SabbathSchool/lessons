## Notes

1. "Behold therefore the goodness."— There is goodness in God's severity. It cut off the Jews as a nation. It did not cut off a single Jew as an individual. If he would not believe, he remained in condemnation. His name as Israel, with the char-acter of a sinner, would not save him. But the severity against those who fell in a national way opened in an equal way to every one the goodness and mercy of God, where "there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free."

2. "Contrary to nature."— According to nature the fruit borne is that of the scion, the engrafted piece, not the root; but contrary to nature, the scion itself becomes changed, and the root indicates the character of the fruit. The Root of Israel is Christ Jesus. The Gentile is a wild olive-branch. But the fruit is of the Root, not the branch.

4. "And so."— That is, by faith in Christ, the Fulness, shall Israel be saved. "Thou [the Gentile convert] standest by faith," and the Jews will stand also if they abide not in unbelief in Christ the Fulness. And therefore there shall come "out of Zion the Deliverer." Only in the Deliverer can fulness of blessing be found.

5. "Enemies... beloved."—Looked upon as a whole, as a nation, the Israelites were excluded, east off for the sake of all others; but they are beloved still for the sake of the covenants made with the fathers.

7. "All... all."— And God has done this because Infinite Wisdom knew that only in His mercy was there hope for man. Man may fix up ten thousand schemes by which it is thought he singly or unitedly may save himself, but all his efforts will prove futile. All are in unbelief, for all have sinned, and He in His goodness proffers mercy unto eternal salvation to all.

8. "Riches,... wisdom,. •. knowledge."—In the fulness of God rests our hope, not in the hoped-for sufficiency of ourselves.

9. Of Him in their origin, through Him in their disposal, unto Him that all His purposes may be fulfilled to His glory. It would seem that the apostle was carried away with God's mar-velous plan of saving man, as he closes this doctrinal part of this marvelous epistle. The grace of Christ, given in God's wisdom, love, and power, meets all man's needs, solves all perplexities, works for man's eternal good, and redounds to the praise and glory of God.
