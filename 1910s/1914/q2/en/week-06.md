## Notes

1. "Be subject."—Be cheerfully obedient. Neither follow Gentile rebellions, nor imbibe the seditious spirit of the Jews; for all authority is of God's ordaining or permission. ''His pre-cepts regard an established power, be what it may. It, in all matters lawful, we are bound to bey.... If the civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before man.... These distinctions must be drawn by the wisdom granted to Christians in the varying circumstances of human affairs. They are all only subordinate portions of the great duty of obedience to law.... But even when law is hard and un-reasonable, not disobedience, but legitimate protest, is the duty of the Christian."— Alford.

2. "A • terror."— The tendency of all proper civil power is salutary, notwithstanding the abuses in government. It would be a fearful world if there were not civil, organized authority. The worst of tyrannical government is better than wild anarchy.

3. "God's minister."— Nebuchadnezzar, even in his proud idolatry, is called God's "servant." He may not have known it, but he was, nevertheless, the minister of God. This has no doubt been true of other governments. Yet apart from. God's over-ruling guidance, they have all shown the inherent, greed and per-versity of fallen humanity.

4. "Conscience' sake."— A higher motive than fear or force actuates the Christian. His own conscience, "for the Lord's sake," will keep him. He needs not laws to compel him or pre-vent him, but to inform him as to what the proper authority re-quires. So long as the authority of the government is exercised in the sphere of civil authority, every true Christian will obey its requirements.

5. "Tribute."— The payment of money for the state. "Cus-tom" is toll, or tax, on produce. "Fear" is to be exercised to-ward those having power, set over us; and "honor" toward all upon whom the state has conferred distinction.

6. Dean Alford remarks: "Pay all other debts. Be indebted in the matter of love alone. This debt increases the more, the more it is paid, because the practise of hive makes the principle of love deeper and more active."

8. "Knowing the time."—Vot mere duration, but the spe-cial, appointed season, the character of the generation and the period in which we live, foretold by great prophecies and signs.

9. "As in the day."— God's children are of the day. The revelers, the dishonest, the immoral, are of the night, and it is toward the dawning of the morning that such a class are always locked in deepest slumber.
