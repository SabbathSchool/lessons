## Notes

2. "Present."—" The verb used is the regular word used for bringing to offer in sacrifice." "Your bodies."—"The body is the organ of practical ac-tivity, which practical activity is to be dedicated to God; better still, as an indication that the sanctification of Christian life is to extend to that part of man's nature which is more completely under the bondage of sin."— Alford. "A living sacrifice."— In contrast to the offerings of beasts which were slain. The beast could be offered but onceb; the body is a continual sacrifice, denying itself all the evil tendencies and lusts, and serving God positively. "Reasonable."—Logical, spiritual. It is rendered both.

3. "Conformed."— Shaped, molded from without.

4. "Transformed."—"Transfigured," molded from within. The world molds us for death; under the creative power of God, we grow into His image.

5. "Good, and acceptable, and perfect" does not apply to the will of God — that can not be otherwise — but that we in ourselves may prove "what is the will of God, namely, that which is good and well-pleasing in Him, and perfect."

6. "Not to think of himself more highly," etc.— A proper abiding conception of the gifts of God's Spirit, or spiritual gifts, would prevent an undue estimate of our own power and ability, and foster humility, and would also keep us from becoming wor-shipers of men. "There is a play on the words here in the orig-inal, which can only be clumsily conveyed in another language: `not to be high-minded above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded as to be sober-minded.' "— Alford.

13. So should we ever regard each other.

19. We will learn, from these scriptures, that the gifts were bestowed upon the church by our Lord through the Spirit when He ascended; that gifts are bestowed upon all; that they are given for His people to improve and to profit by in the upbuild-ing of the church and the work of the ministry; that they are given as God wills — not as man wills; that they are to remain in the church till our Lord's return; that then all will have to account for their use. These gifts are very precious, and our Lord likens them to highest denominations of money in the Jew-ish and Roman systems.

10. "With simplicity."— Better, ''with liberality," or "lib-erally." "With cheerfulness."—"It is in exhibiting compas-sion, which is often the compulsory work of one obeying his con-science rather than the spontaneous effusion of love, that cheer-fulness is so peculiarly required, and so frequently wanting."— Alf ord. How do you answer the offending one; who has apologized or who asks forgiveness? Do you cheer fully say, I freely and fully forgive? or does your very manner imply that in your heart you condemn?
