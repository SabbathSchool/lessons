## Notes

12. This is the law of God's kingdom,— every one in his. appointed place, every one working for all others, and each served by all, blessed by all. Only love can do this.

2. "It is written."— The words quoted from this psalm are addressed to the Father, not to man. But they show that Jesus, while doing the Father's work, bore in His own person all the reproaches that men had cast upon the Father. They show that Jesus pleased not Himself.

3. "Through patience and comfort of the Scriptures."— Through the patience and comfort which the Scriptures give, hope is born and confirmed in the hearts of the children of faith. "The expression, 'Whatsoever things were written aforetime,' applies to the whole ancient Scriptures (the Old Testament), not to the prophetic parts only."— Alford.

4. Dwell on the clauses of the text —"the God of patience," the long-suffering God; "the God of... consolation," the com-forting God; "like-minded one toward another," to build one another up; not according to the world, or our own limited, im-perfect way, but "according to Christ Jesus." Then will God indeed be glorified.

5. The praise given to God shows how far His salvation ex-tended, and it included both Jew and Gentile. It all centers in the Root, our blessed Lord.

6. "The God of hope."— The God of patience, or long-suffer- ing, is also the God of hope, the One from whom all our hopes spring, in whom they all center. The inspired prayer is God's "promise to the children of faith. He will fill the believer with all joy and peace, that hope may abound. The power through which this is accomplished is that of the Holy Spirit.
