## Notes

1. "Weak in the faith."— Alford suggests that this ''weak in the faith" was probably the overscrupulous Jewish convert afraid of meats offered to idols, or of being brought into contact with undiscoverable uncleanness. In foreign lands he abstained from prepared food, and ate only that which he could trace from nature to his own use. Various ceremonial days had strong hold upon a conscience not wholly enlightened and a faith not strong. These converts were to be received as Christians, and their doubt-ful thoughts not judged or condemned.

2. "Not judge."— The very scrupulous should not "judge" — condemn — his brother who eats, for God has received him. The strong in faith should not " despise"— consider as of no account — the brother who was wavering, doubtful, perhaps over-scrupulous.

3. "Shall be holden up."— Despite man's judgment, God is able to make His children stand. One of the great, dominant thoughts of this chapter is, Judge not.

1. The controversy and the questionings pertained to the national feast-days, as Passover, Pentecost, and others, which had been celebrated as a matter of lifelong habit by the Jews. As feasts of Levitical obligation they were no more of force after the cross, but as national festivals they had a strong hold upon many among the Jewish converts.

5. "In his own mind."— God holds each one responsible. Each person must, or should, decide for himself. And this is true in moral as well as ceremonial observances. The power of choice is for each individual to exercise.

6. "And he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it" is not found in the Revised Version, not being in the best Greek manuscripts.
