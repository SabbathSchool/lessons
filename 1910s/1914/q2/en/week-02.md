## Notes

2. "Israel hath not;... the election hath."— Israel sought righteousness by works. But how could they obtain it, for all their works fell short of God's glory. Faith in the free grace of God was wanting. The election obtained righteousness, be-cause they chose it, chose God's grace, God's righteousness in their behalf, chose all for which He had chosen them.

3. "Blinded."— Better "hardened," as in the margin. They were hardened because they would not accept God's way, and God let them have their own way.

4. "Let."— As they are determined to walk in their own way, let them have it, let them have all the fruitage thereof. All the things mentioned are the legitimate fruit and consequences of their own choice.

79. But though cast off in their national capacity, God eagerly longed that they as individuals should come into the fold through Christ.

6. "The fall... their fulness."— God would have used the nation of Israel to enlighten the world in the fullest sense if they had yielded fully to Him; but when their whole effort and thought was for themselves, they held the world back from the riches of God's grace entrusted to them. Their fall as a nation, and the proclamation of the gospel to all alike, opened to the world the infinite riches of God's grace. But even greater blessings would have been given if they had yielded all, so. that God could have used them as a positive force in the work of carrying the gospel.
