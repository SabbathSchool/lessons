# The Obedience of Faith
JUNE 20, 1914

**Lesson Scripture**: Rom. 16:21-27. 34 SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

## Questions

1. What fellow worker and friend of Paul sent greet-ing to the church at Rome? 

2. Who wrote the epistle for Paul? What did he say? 

3. What others sent salutations? 

4. What benediction did the apostle repeat? 

17. What is the closing word? 

## Notes

4. The identity of none of these is certain, but probable.

3. God's great plan of salvation is not new. Sin did not take Him by surprise. All the efforts of Satan against the govern-ment of heaven have made more glorious God's love and mercy. The death of Jesus, designed of the evil one to destroy the king-dom of God, in God's wisdom opened up and revealed such depths of God's love as amazed the universe. The silence of the ages burst into an eternal song of praise.

4. "Obedience."— This is the purpose of the gospel. The "obedience of faith," the trusting, loving obedience of the child to a father worthy to be loved. If the gospel fails in this, it fails of its purpose. But, praise God, it never fails.'

5. Amen.—` `Yea," "verily," "it is true." It is a Hebrew word meaning firm, constant, certain, sure. It affirms the truth of what is spoken. Let it be in us, all that God designs in this epistle, in Christ Jesus. For "all the promises of God in Him are yea, and in Him Amen."
