## Notes

3. Your strong faith is good. Let it not justly be condemned.

5. "Destroy not"-- Destroy neither yourself in overindul-gence, nor your neighbor by a bad example.

6. "Because he eateth not of faith."â€” Faith has respect to God, and centers in Him. It has respect not alone to His prom-ises, but to His precepts. In all things it defers to Him, yields to Him. "Without faith it is impossible to please Him." Not to please Him is to be out of harmony with Him, and out of har-mony with God is sin.
