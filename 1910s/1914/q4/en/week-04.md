13. Notes z. The Revised Version, margin, of this text reads, "My brethren, do ye, in accepting persons, hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord. of glory?" None who profess the. pure and undefiled religion of our Lord should countenance any. dis-tinction, or manifest any partiality, among members of the church, because of difference in wealth or social standing. We are all one in Christ Jesus.

3. We are here cited to the higher, supreme law, before which all will stand on an equality. There will-be no rich or poor, no high or low. Right and wrong, guilt and innocence alone will be considered. It is the "royal law" because it is the law of the great King. Before this law all must how. By it all differences must finally be settled.

37. This law is spiritual and perfect, extending to all the inward creations and outward actions of men, and can never be changed or an-nulled. Binney's Theological Compend," page
