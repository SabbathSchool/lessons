15. Who is set forth as our example at this time? Verse to. Notes I. "The, term 'riches' is to be taken... generically for all kinds of property having a money value which is proverbially liable to loss or perishing."— Clarke.

2. "A witness." "Their putrefied stores, moth-eaten garments, and tarnished coin are so many proofs that it was not for want of property that they did not help the poor, but through selfish-ness and avarice they defrauded the poor." • "Eat your flesh as it were fire." "This is a very bold and striking figure. He represents the rust of their 'coin as becoming a canker that should produce gangrenes and phagedenous ulcers in their flesh, till it should be eaten away from their bones."— Clarke.

3. "In a paper on 'The Concentration of Wealth,' Henry L. Call, of Washington, D. C., says: 'Fifty years ago there were not to exceed fifty millionaires in the United States, and their combined fortunes did not exceed probably one hundred million dollars, or one per cent of the then aggregate wealth of the nation. To-day a bare one per cent of our population owns practically ninety-nine per cent of the entire wealth of the nation.' "—"Capital and Labor."

5. The reference to the early and the latter rain has a broader application. The early rain was the rain of seed-time, the latter rain was the rain of ripening for the harvest. The first fell in Judea about November; the second toward the end of April, when the ears of grain were filling. Without these the earth would have been unfruitful. In like manner the former rain of the Spirit fell at Pentecost to water the seed. The latter rain is to fall to ripen the harvest of the earth. We are to be patient until then.

6. In the time of trial, we are not to grow impatient, and seek, as many do, to right wrongs by resorting to force and questionable methods; but we should look forward patiently to the time when Jesus will come, and render a just reward to every man.
