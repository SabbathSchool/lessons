23. Notes t. James assumes no title. He does not claim to be the Lord's brother, or an apostle, or bishop at Jerusalem. He simply designates himself as "a servant of God," a title which is an honor above all others. He writes to the twelve tribes scattered abroad,—to all Christians. His exhortations to faith, stability, obedience, patience, and devotion to God, while equally applicable to any age and to any people, may be especially helpful to those who live. through the conflicts of the last days.

3. "The word which is here translated 'temptation' signifies affliction, persecution, or trial of any kind; and in this sense is used here."— Clarke. When temptations come, we are not to consider them as a punishment, or as some curse or calamity visited upon us because we are wicked. God's people in all ages have been tried, many even suffering death.

4. The word "steadfastness" is given in the margin of the Revised Version instead of "patience." This gives the true idea. A person might seemingly be very patient and yet be very un-stable. The design of all trials is to develop steadfastness, and stability is wrought into the character of the person who patiently endures trials.
