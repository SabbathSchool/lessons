26. Notes i. "Can faith save him?"—Yes, real faith can save the soul. "By grace are ye saved, through faith." "He that believeth.. shall be saved." Works can not save us. We are saved by faith alone. But the writer of this epistle is seeking to show that the mere profession of faith does not prove that we have faith. James is setting forth the emptiness of the claim when there is no fruit in the life as proof. A sign advertising wares for sale is not sure evidence that the goods are within. The meaning here seems to be that that faith which a man may claim to have, but which does not manifest itself in a holy life, will save no one, for it is not genuine faith.

2. The apostle Paul speaks of the "work of faith." i Thess.:

3. Faith is living, and manifests itself in good works. That kind of faith which will permit a man to say, "I have faith," and at the same time allow the destitute and naked to go unfed and unclothed, when he might minister to their needs, is of no avail. It is dead. It does not exist in reality. Such a person does not really believe. He is professing to be what he is not. The fruit seen in the life will determine whether or not we have real faith. The tree is known by the fruit.

4. A. mere intellectual belief is not faith. It will save no„one. The fallen angels intellectually believe in a God. They know He exists. They have been in heaven. They know something of His nature and majesty, though engaged in warfare against Him. Their belief does not lead them to repentance. It terri-fies them. They tremble at the knowledge of the 'future which their belief reveals to them. Many have what 'might be termed an intellectual belief in the existence of God; and in tliinspira-tion of the Word, yet continue in sin:. Real faith 'leads to a refor-Mation Of life, a surrendering of all to God, manifested in a seiv. ice of love.
