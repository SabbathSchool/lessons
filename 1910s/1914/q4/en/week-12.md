## Notes

2. "I saw that anciently the covetousness of some led them to withhold a suitable proportion; they made their offering stinted. This was recorded in heaven, and they were cursed in their har-vest and their flocks just as they withheld. Some were visited with affliction in their families. God would not accept a lame offering."—Id., page

4. "A concealed golden wedge and a Babylonish garment troubled the entire camp of Israel. The frown of God was brought upon the people because of the sin of one man. Thou-sands were slain upon the field of battle because God would not bless and prosper a people among whom there was even one sinner, one who had transgressed His word."—Id., page

5. "I saw that many who profess to be keeping the command-ments of God are appropriating to their own use the means which the Lord has intrusted to them, and which should come into His treasury. They rob God in tithes and in offerings. They dissemble, and withhold from Him to their own hurt. They bring leanness and poverty upon themselves and darkness upon the church, because of their covetousness, their dissembling, and their robbing God in tithes and offerings."— Id., page
