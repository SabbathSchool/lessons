7. Notes I. James continues his exhortation and admonition to those who through lack of Christian experience were guilty of the things mentioned in the previous lesson. Thorough repentance and humiliation of heart are demanded from those who trans-gress the instruction of the Lord.

2. "Mourners and penitents lay on the ground and rolled themselves in the dust. When comforted and pardoned, they arose from the earth, shook themselves from the dust, and clothed themselves in their better garments. God promises to raise men from the dust, when they are truly humbled."— Clarke.

3. "There is nothing more decidedly condemned in the Scrip-tures than the habit of pronouncing a judgment on the motives and conduct of others. There is nothing in which we are more liable to err, or to indulge in wrong feelings'; and there is noth-ing which God claims more for Himself as His peculiar prerog-ative."— Barnes.

4. Those who judge usurp the office and prerogative of the supreme Judge. As God alone knows the heart and can read the motives, He alone can be the Judge. Those, therefore, who assume to judge others, put themselves in the place of God, which is the essence of the papacy. '

6. The Revised Version reads: "What is your life?. For ye are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away." Surely man, being but vapor, has nothing whereof to boast: How needful that he lay hold upon an enduring sub-stance!
