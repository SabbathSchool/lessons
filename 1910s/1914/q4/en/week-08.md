7. Notes I. Hitherto the instruction and admonitions seem to have been somewhat general. But now the application is made more personal: "Whence come wars and fightings among you." "Not public or national wars, nor yet conflicts in the courts, but rather quarrels growing out of their selfishness and unchari-tableness."— Clarke.

2. "Ye have not, because ye ask not." One of the great causes of all spiritual death, and strife in homes and churches, is here pointed out. It is the lack of prayer.

3. "The general sense is: If you prayed aright, this feeling of continued craving after more of worldly things would not exist. All your proper wants would be supplied; and these im-proper ones, which beget wars and fightings among you, would not exist."— Alford.

4. This world has its god. We can not worship the God of heaven and the god of this world. Those who bow before the god of this world are truly the enemies of God. "How strange it is that people professing Christianity can suppose that with a worldly spirit, worldly companions, and their lives governed by worldly maxims, they can be in favor of God, or have a place in the kingdom of heaven! When the world gets into the church, the church becomes a painted sepulcher, its spiritual vitality being extinct."— Clarke.

5. , The Revised Version, margin, reads: "Or think ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain? That Spirit which He made to dwell in us yearneth for us even unto jealous envy." This rendering contains a promise of the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to resist envy.

6. "The sure way to please God is to submit to the dispen-sations of His grace and providence; and when a man acknowl-edges Him in all his ways, He will direct all his steps. The covetous man grasps at the shadow and loses the substance." — Clarke.
