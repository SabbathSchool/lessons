3. Four illustrations are given, showing the inconsistency of living such a contradictory life: (a) a fountain; (b) a fig-tree; (c) a vine; (d) salt water. A fountain can not produce sweet water and bitter; a fig-tree can not produce olive berries; a•vitie can not bear figs; the sea can not yield fresh water. According to the ordinary operations of nature, these things are iMpossible. All these illustrations are used to show the utter impossibility of depravity and virtue dwelling in the same heart, or of th_love of God dwelling in the heart when hatred and maliee are cherished.

4. Proud, haughty, disdainful, unholy persons may pass for great scholars, and have the reputation of being very learned, but such do not have true wisdom. This comes from above, and is revealed in a holy life. •

5. That "the life is the light" is. true of Christ's followers also. We are epistles known and read of men. Our words have but little weight unless they are emphasized by a consistent life.

6. "If ye be under the influence of an unkind, fierce,' and con-temptuous spirit, even while attempting or pretending to defend true religion, do not boast.... Ye have no religion, and no true wisdom; and to profess either is to lie against the truth."— Clarke. •
