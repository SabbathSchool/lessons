## Notes

2. The Lord placed a blessing on-the Sabbath day, and those who keep it find the blessing. We hear this testimony from men and women in all lands. The Sabbath is a blessed gift from God to men — something given to us, not a day taken from us, as appears to unbelief.

3. Some people object, "Do you think Sabbath-keeping will save you?" Not at all. In fact, we must be saved from sin by faith in Jesus in order truly to keep the Sabbath. So it is with obedience to all God's commandments. We are not saved be-cause we obey, but we obey because we have found the saving grace of Christ. The call to keep the Sabbath holy is in a direct way a call to holiness of life and the putting away of sin.

4. "God requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed now as in the time of Israel. The command given to the He-brews should be regarded by all Christians as an injunction from Jehovah to them. The day before the Sabbath should be made a day of preparation, that 'everything may be in readiness for its sacred hours. In no case should our own business be allowed to encroach upon holy time. God has directed that the sick and suffering be cared for; the labor required to make them com-fortable is a work of mercy, and no violation of the Sabbath; but all unnecessary work should be avoided. Many carelessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things that might have been done on the day of preparation. This should not be. Work that is neglected until the beginning of the Sabbath should remain undone until it is past. This course might help the memory of these thoughtless ones, and make them careful to do their own work on the six working-days."—"Patriarchs and-Prophets," page
