## Notes

5. While primarily the education of the child is the duty of the parent, the training of the children of the church is a part of church duty. "Feed My lambs," said Jesus to the church. "Let all share the expense. Let the church see that those who ought to receive its benefits are attending the school. Poor families should be assisted. We can not call ourselves true-missionaries if we neglect those at our very doors, who are at the most crit-ical age, and who need our aid to secure knowledge and experi-ence that will fit them for the service of God."—Idem, page

6. "It should be the great aim in every intermediate school to do most thorough work in the common branches."—"Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students," page

210. "The word of God is to lie at the foundation of all the _work done in our intermediate schools. And the students are to be shown the true dignity of labor."— /dem, page

126. "While attending school,. the youth should haVe an opportunity for learning the use of tools.. Under the guidance of experi-enced workmen, carpenters who are apt to teach, patient, and kind, the students themselves should erect buildings on the school grounds and make needed improvements, thus by practical les-sons learning how to build economically. The students should also be trained to manage all the different kinds of work con-nected with printing, such as typesetting, presswork, and book-binding, together with tent-making and other useful lines of work. Small fruits shoilld be planted, and vegetables and flowers cultivated, and this work the lady students may be called out-of-doors to do. ThuS, while exercising brain, bone, and muscle, they will also be gaining a knowledge of practical life."—Idem, page

8. "There is a dearth of educated ability among us, and we have not men who are sufficiently trained to do justice to the work."—"Christian Education," page

138. "It is fjr the honor of Christ that well-educated workers should be multiplied among us; they will be better able to com-municate the truth in a clear, intelligent way, and the truth should be presented in a way that will be as free as possible from defects."—Idene, page

138. "There is more need now than ever before that our young men and women shall be intellectually qualified for the work.... The mind receives its tone and efficiency by thorough discipline." — Ident, page
