## Notes

1. Observe in all the epistles of the New Testament, except those of John, the custom of the writer's announcing his identity at the beginning of the epistle rather than at the close, as we do now. Even John does the same in the book of Revelation.

2. Simon's step was a threefold one: (a) his adopting, as a principle of action, "At Thy word"; (b) his repentance and con-fession of sin; (c) his forsaking all, especially his bright busi-ness prospects, and following Jesus.

3. For Simon to say directly and boldly; "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," meant much when Jesus was scoffed at by the religious leaders of the people as an impostor. No other such declaration is recorded during the life of Christ on earth, except the announcement by John the Baptist. That Simon was advancing in divine life is attested by Jesus' an-swer in verse

4. Simon doubtless made this declaration sincerely. Though he failed to live up to it during his discipleship, yet during his apostleship it was fulfilled to the letter. That he should feel and express such whole-hearted consecration, marks an advance step in his Christian experience, despite the fact that he was not ready for so severe a test.

2. What is the theme of. chapter i in Peter's second epistle? • Ails.— Christian growth. (Read the chapter through, noting, the terms "multiplied," "add," "beside this," "abound," "give diligence.") Note

5. How is this "precious faith" obtained? Verse I, last part. Note

6. How are grace and peace multiplied? Verse

7. What is the measure of experimental knowledge God would have us gain? Verse

8. What is the twofold object of these wonderful gifts of divine power and precious promises? Verse

8. What is the result of having these things-"abound" (literally, increase) in us? Verse

12. What is the woful state of one who lacks these things? Verse

13. To what should the believer give diligence? Why? Verse HD.

14. What shall be added as the fruit of faithfulness? Verse i

9. Notes I. In Peter's own summary at the conclusion of this epistle are clearly seen the key words to the twofold burden that called it forth: "beware" and "grow"; in other words, warning and exhortation. In dealing with the two, Peter puts exhortation first — first in order and first in importance.

2. Peter's Christian experience had beeri an intense one. More than any other of the disciples, perhaps, he had gone to the extreme of failure at the crisis of his Master's humiliation. Now that his work is about done, Peter feels especially anxious that after his death the believers shall continue to grow in ex-perimental, knowledge of God.

6. It denotes thorough knowledge, knowing a thing as it really is. It implies expanding, added knowledge, and may properly be rendered here "knowledge upon knowledge," until it includes "all things that pertain unto life and godliness."

7. It should be noted here that after the sinner has been rec-onciled to God and has made every known adjustment with his neighbor, his Christian life has only begun. The seed of faith has 'been merely planted; he must now cultivate the plant dili-gently. He has merely cleared the obstructions to advancement in the strait and narrow way. He has only laid the foundation of the spiritual temple for God's indwelling; he must now work at his own profession and build with "all diligence."

8. FAITH: belief to the saving of the soul. Heb. lo:

9. The word "ministered" in verse II is the same word that is rendered "add" in verse.

5. Not satisfied to have his influence stop even at his death, to what end did Peter labor?

6. What reason does he give for his earnestness? Verse

7. Do we treat the truth committed to us at this time as fables to be enjoyed, or as a solemn message given to stir men's hearts to repentance and steadfastness?

2. I I. To what is prophecy compared? Verse

13. What assurance is given us about the origin of prophecy? Verse zo. Note

2. This passage is sometimes interpreted to mean, We have the word of prophecy made more sure by the witness of the eye and the ear. But it reads literally thus: And we have more sure the prophetic word. This reading, and the additional fact that Peter lays the emphasis on taking heed to the prophecy rather than depending on his personal testimony, and supports his exhortation by showing how prophecy came, seem sufficient to justify our interpreting the passage thus: And we have,' as a more sure testimony than that of one who had seen the trans-figuration and heard the voice, the prophetic word. The angel of the annunciation quoted prophecy; Simeon was waiting for its fulfilment when he recognized the child Jesus; and Peter himself had depended largely upon prophecy in interpreting the meaning of Pentecost.

3. We can appreciate the force of this figure when we consider how great a light prophecy sheds on present-day events which without it would be as dark to believers as to unbelievers.

3. What influence do their teachings have? What is the result of their course? Verse

6. What is the earliest example of God's dealing with persistent teachers of heresy? Verse

7. How did God deal justice to unrepentant sinners in the time of Noah? Verse

8. What example of the end of the ungodly did God give in the days of Lot? Verse

9. Recall in this con-nection some of Peter's own deliverances.

1. What two classes of sin are especially offetisive to God? Verse io, first part.

12. After faith has wrought reconciliation of the sin-ner to God, what is the first Christian grace to be culti-vated? i Peter i:

17. What shows that such persons boldly venture upon ground where angels fear to tread? Verse II. i

1. As the defection among-the angels in heaven, headed by Lucifer, was at first carried on by secret insinuations and covert motives, so these false teachers do their work "privily." The true follower of Jesus should ever be on his guard against sly suggestions. "confidential" tales, and skeptical intimations; for what looks innocent at first often leads to serious consequences, even to shipwreck of faith.

3. The Lord saved Noah because he was "a just man," "per-fect in his generation," and because he "walked with God." But Lot, for the sake of sordid gain, pitched his tent in the cities of the plain, dwelling among men who were "wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly." All but two of his daughters married-Sodomites and perished with them. Yet the Lord, at the earnest entreaties of Abraham, five times repeated, saved Lot by the extreme measure of sending two angels to his house, who finally had to lay hands on him and draw him out of destruction.

4. For the one who is afflicted with impure, unwholesome thoughts, this is a gospel and psychological remedy — keep the mind dwelling upon such wholesome, uplifting things as are enumerated in this verse. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."

5. Here are three steps, given in logical order, which if taken will keep a man from becoming a despiser of government or of good organization of any kind: T. Submit to God.

2. Submit to one another in the fear of God.

6. Under what figures are false teachers further de-scribed? Verse

7. What is the nature of their work?" Verse i

4. to. What does Peter say of those who "have escaped the pollutions of the world," then afterward "have for-saken the right way" and sunk again into sin? Verse

5. i i. By what homely but striking proverbs does Peter describe the condition of one who has returned to a life of sin? Verse

12. What would have been better for these who have turned from such great light? Verse

2. The cover of night is usually sought for evil excesses of all kinds. When people come to the place where they find pleasure in such indulgences" in the daytime, it indicates a repro-bate condition. The reward of such is no worse than the reward of false teachers, according to the severe arraignment of them in this chapter.

3. It is "unstable souls" that are drawn into the vortex of sin. How important, then, to give all diligence to building solid ele-ments of stability into the character, according to the outline in "Peter's rainbow" of character in chapter

5. That there is added responsibility in a knowledge of the truth, is no excuse for a man to avoid learning more of it. He is held as responsible for his opportunities to know as for his actual knowledge.
