## Notes

2. The strongest argument of last-day scoffers in their minds — is that "all things continue as they were from the be-ginning of the creation." Thus it seems to the casual observer, as he looks out on a perfect day, at the clear blue sky, the beau-tiful trees and flowers, the /terry birds and children, and as he looks further upon the wonderful progress in the arts and sciences and the spread of knowledge. Yet these fail to look upon the signs the Saviour said should appear in the heavens, the sea,-and the things of nature-and experience about us. It is only the light of the Word, as Peter goes on to show, that will enable us to interpret correctly the external, material signs given us, in addition to prophetic periods, as evidence of Christ's soon coming.

5. "By the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of Judgment." The Revised Version, margin, reads thus: "By the same word have been stored with fire, being reserved against the day of Judgment." This reading makes clearer the meaning of the whole passage,— that as the water stored in the heavens and the earth was turned 'into an element of destruction at the time of the Flood, so in the day of Judg-ment the fire stored in the heavens and the earth will be used in the destruction of ungodly men.

2. "Burned up." In the comment by Westcott and Hort on the passage, other readings are given: "shall not be found," "shall disappear." The whole passage is evidently intended to describe the natural results of intense heat.

3. The effect should not be that of stimulating to greater spiritual earnestness merely because of a "fearful looking for of indignation," but knowledge of such an end to material things ought to lead us not to put our trust in them, but to "desire a better country," a "kingdom which shall never be destroyed."

2. Notice the marginal reading of the text, "run out as leak-ing vessels." Unless the truths that we know, are kept living and bright in our hearts by daily personal experience in the Lord, the level of our "love of the truth" will be found sinking lower and lower, imperceptibly perhaps, as water sinks slowly in a leaking vessel. The Revision puts it, "Lest haply we drift away from them." No ships drift into port, but it is easy to drift with tide and current or storm out of the harbor of safety.

3. We can 'no more expect to be spiritually strong without feeding the soul upon the word of God, than physically strong without eating our daily food. Take some Scripture portion into every day's work, and let it speak to the heart again and again amidst the hurry of business. It will keep the thought of God near.
