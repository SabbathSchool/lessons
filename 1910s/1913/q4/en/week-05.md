## Notes

1. "To them."—There are two classes of persons. One class is composed of those who by patient continuance in well-doing are seeking God's glory and honor, and the immortality, or incorruption which He only can give. To all such He will give eternal life. God does this now in answer to faith. See John 3:16; 1 John 5:11, 12. In the great day of final reward He will give the believers eternal life absolutely forevermore, and make their frail bodies immortal. To the other class who have been contentious and disobedient He will render the fruitage of their doings. They have refused to obey the truth, but have followed unrighteousness. To them belongs indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish. It is at awful cost that man identifies himself with sin.


2. "Upon every soul."—To the Jew first, because his privileges have been greater, his light stronger and clearer. To the one to whom first comes the great revelation of God's grace, to him first comes judgment.


3. "Glory, honor, and peace."—God's glory of character, God's honor upon the faithful, God's peace to him who lays down his arms of rebellion. Surely this is worth striving for.


4. "Without law."—That is, without the written law. Every responsible human being has some consciousness of wrong. If followed it will lead to clearer light. If turned from it will lead to greater darkness. God watches over those whose heart (not wisdom) is perfect toward Him. 2 Chron. 16:9. Every soul is given light enough to save him if he will but follow it; and according to the light rejected will he be judged.


5. "Law unto themselves."—This does not mean that God will accept a human standard; but that the Gentile finds in his own conscience and mind all the standard he knows. God by His Spirit and providence will work all He can in such hearts and will regard the motive. One ray of light permitted to dominate the soul will bring salvation.


6. "In the day."—There is a close connection between verses 12 and 16, verses 13 to 15 being simply parenthetical and explanatory. The two classes named in verse 12 "shall be judged . . . in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel." All cherished evil, all human secrets, will be hidden no longer. The One by whom we are judged has been over the road before us. Absolute justice will then be done. It is in view of the judgment we should live, not what our neighbor may say or do.
