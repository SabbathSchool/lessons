## Notes

1. "Thou art called a Jew."—This was an honorable name. Resting in the law, and glorying in God, were good, as far as they went. But they did this only in form, and an empty form can bring only condemnation. The law referred to was doubtless God's primal law, or Decalogue, of which the apostle cites three precepts later on. Verses 21-23.


2. "Being instructed."—From the outward teaching of the law the Jew had to a great extent learned right doctrine. He approved the excellent things of the law, having learned that the law is an expression of God's will. Ps. 40:7, 8.


3. "Form of knowledge in the law."—We must not make the mistake with the Jew that the outward form is sufficient; nor should we make an equal mistake with the liberalist, or antinomian, that no form, or rule, is necessary. Paul expressly affirms that the Jew had in the law "the form of knowledge and of the truth." The form therefore was correct. The seventh-day Sabbath, observed by the Jew, was the correct form, the right outward observance. What was needed was the spirit, the life of the word in the form. A form though it be a true form, if alone, has no life.


4. A form of godliness without the power leads to all manner of sin, and brings reproach upon God's name and cause. If the life of the professed people of God is what it ought to be, we need not fear for the doctrine of truth. It is extremely sad when God's own people by unconsecrated lives dishonor His name and cause.


5. Circumcision was given as a sign of righteousness, a mark of separation from the world. Rom. 4:11. The Jew who boasted of his conformity to that rite declared in words that he was righteous. If his claim was true, the token was of great profit. It spoke of a righteous man. In other words, the profession of circumcision would have been a true token if the life was in harmony with God. If not, the circumcision was nothing. The circumcised man was a sinner the same as others.


6. The word "judge" is used in the sense of condemn. The obedient though uncircumcised condemned the disobedient though he be circumcised.


7. "Not a Jew."—Merely the name Jew could not save any one. Outward profession alone counted for nothing in God's sight.


8. The true Jew is the one who is Christ's, a true, converted Christian. The cleansed, loyal heart is alone accepted in God's sight. The true Jew is the man of faith. The true circumcision is that crucifixion with Christ which separates from sin.


9. "The Pharisees and the Pharisaic Judaizers sought to gain the praise of men by their outward show of sanctity; which is here contrasted with the inward holiness which seeks no praise but that of God. The same contrast occurs in the Sermon on the Mount."—Conybeare and Howson.
