## Notes

1. Paul, the former Saul of Tarsus, is the author of the epistle to the Romans. It is quite generally agreed that it was written from Corinth, in A.D. 57 or 58, when the apostle was about to go up to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. Conybeare and Howson say:

   "The date of this epistle is very properly fixed by the following statements contained in it:

   "(1) St. Paul had never yet been to Rome (chap. 1:11, 13, 15).

   "(2) He was intending to go to Rome, after first visiting Jerusalem (chap. 15:23-28). This was exactly his purpose during his three months' residence at Corinth. See Acts 19:21.

   "(3) He was going to bear a collection of alms from Macedonia and Achaia to Jerusalem (chap. 15:26, 31). This he did carry from Corinth to Jerusalem at the close of his three months' visit. See Acts 24:17.

   "(4) When he wrote the epistle, Timotheus, Sosipater, Gaius, and Erastus were with him (chap. 16:21, 23); of these, the first three are expressly mentioned in the Acts as having been with him at Corinth during the three months' visit (see Acts 20:4); and the last, Erastus, was himself a Corinthian, and had been sent shortly before from Ephesus (Acts 19:22) with Timotheus on the way to Corinth. Compare 1 Cor. 16:10, 11."—"Life and Epistles of St. Paul," People's Edition, pages 544, 545.

   The object of the epistle is to teach the meaning of salvation through the gospel of Jesus Christ in all its fullness.


2. "A servant."—God calls His children sons, daughters, saints, friends; but the devoted saint of God finds joy in calling himself "a servant," literally, a bond-servant, a bought slave, purchased by the blood of Christ, and bound to Him by Spirit-born love.


3. "Called to be an apostle."—The word "apostle" means one who is sent. It is a term which our Lord gave to each of the twelve, and on the failure of Judas Iscariot, Matthias was chosen and numbered with the eleven. But it is a mistake to suppose that apostleship was confined to the twelve, or that Paul was one of the twelve. The twelve were sent to Israel. Paul was an apostle—one authoritatively sent, a messenger—to the Gentiles. Barnabas, Epaphroditus, Timothy, and Silvanus are called apostles also. The first twelve apostles, bearing witness that Jesus was the living Christ, must as a necessary qualification have seen the Lord, and Paul refers to his experience to show he was not behind the other apostles in this respect (1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8). But that this is not necessary to apostleship is shown (1) in the calling of Barnabas and others, and (2) in the fact that the gift of apostleship is to be in the church to the end. "The Greek," says Vincent, "indicates that the writer was actually in the apostolate—a called apostle."


4. "Separated unto."—"Separated unto" also implies separated from, a distinct marking off, a cleavage from the mass. So Paul and Barnabas were separated unto God's work (Acts 13:2), and Paul was set apart for his work from his birth (Gal. 1:15, 16). So God calls every one to some work, and separates them to that in His own good time if they are but submitted to His will.


5. "Of the seed of David."—Christ was, therefore, of the royal line through His mother. But He was more than this; He was the same flesh as the seed of David, in and through which for generations had flowed the blood of sinful humanity,—Solomon, and Rehoboam, and Ahaz, and Manasseh, and Amon, and Jeconiah, and others. The Son of God took this same flesh in order that He might meet temptation for us, and overcome with divine power every trial we must meet. Christ is our Brother in the flesh, our Saviour from sin.


6. "Declared to be."—Jesus was the Son of God before He was born of the virgin Mary. He was the only-begotten Son of God from the days of eternity. When on earth He was divinity incarnate in humanity, clothed with its weaknesses. To the unbeliever He was but a man. Selfish hearts could not read His motives; sin-blinded souls could not see His divinity of character. Yet it was there, though the world—nay, His own people—knew it not, and crucified Him. But His resurrection from the dead declared His holiness, His power over sin, His dominion over death, His divinity. Acts 2:24.


7. "The Spirit of holiness."—The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters when the world was created. Jesus was born of the Spirit. In Him "the spirit is life because of righteousness;" and if His Spirit dwell in us there will be manifest in us the same fruits as were witnessed in the life of Jesus. Rom. 8:10, 11.


8. "For obedience to the faith."—Better as given in the American Revised Version, "unto obedience of faith." There is no other obedience acceptable to God. "Obedience of faith is the obedience which characterizes and proceeds from faith."—Vincent.


9. "Called to be saints."—The word "saints" does not necessarily imply perfect persons. "The term hagioi, saints, is applied to Christians in three senses in the New Testament: (1) as members of a visible and local community (Acts 9:32, 41; 26:10); (2) as members of a spiritual community (1 Cor. 1:2; Col. 3:12); (3) as individually holy (Eph. 1:18; Col. 1:12; Rev. 13:10)."—"Word Studies," Vincent. The saints are those who are separated from the world, and set apart to God and His service. As we are called to be saints, the lessons of this epistle are for us.


10. "Grace." God's unmerited favor; "peace." God's proclamation to us as rebels. His thoughts toward us are thoughts of mercy and peace. Jer. 29:11. If we are not at peace with God, it is because our hearts are in rebellion. All heaven desires to be at peace with us.
