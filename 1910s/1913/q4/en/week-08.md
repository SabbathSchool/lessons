## Notes

1. "To them who are under the law."—Literally, to them "within" the law, that is, subject to its jurisdiction. This would include all responsible beings in heaven and earth, for all are amenable to God. As all the world have transgressed the law, they have no defense before God, and stand guilty in His sight. A law that condemns all therefore must be universal and uniform in its claims.


2. It is quite evident to the thoughtful student that no law can justify its transgressor; it can only condemn him. No transgressed human law even can justify the criminal. It can only pronounce him guilty. No intelligent Bible student will look to the law for justification. It is by the light which shines from the law that the exceeding sinfulness of sin is made known.


3. Man is sin-sick and helpless. The righteousness which will justify must come from without the sinner, apart from his own imperfections. This is the righteousness which comes to us through the gospel (chapter 1:16). But this righteousness must be in harmony with God to be acceptable to Him. It is the gift of God, through faith, apart from works, and is the same righteousness that is in the law. But man because of his weakness and sinfulness, can not of himself attain unto this righteousness. But thanks be to God, He meets our need, and gives unto us His own eternal righteousness.


4. "All have sinned."—All have sinned, or "missed the mark." All have come short of the glory of God's character, and only the glory of His character through grace can save us, and enable those who have come short to attain unto the mark of His high calling in Christ.


5. "Set forth,"—margin "foreordained." 1 Cor. 2:7, 8. Jesus is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13:8. His suffering and death were but steps in the great plan of redemption. He was ordained to be a propitiation—a mercy-seat—where justice and mercy meet,—and the sin-burdened soul finds forgiveness through Him. But the mercy freely given of God comes only through faith in Jesus' blood as the great sin cleanser. When faith grasps Jesus as the Saviour, His righteousness becomes our righteousness, and all past sins are forgiven. Jesus was foreordained, set forth, to do this for all who believe.


6. Jesus is the Justifier of the believer. In the graphic words of Bishop Lowth's translation, He stoops and says to the hopeless sinner on his way to the judgment, "Come on now, and let us plead together." He will be our daysman, our mediator before the judge. Jesus is the Saviour who is to wash white as snow the scarlet sins, and "all the fitness He requireth is to feel our need of Him." As our Justifier He has willingly paid the penalty which was our due, and His sacrifice is acceptable with God. It is ours to accept the Substitute, and be delivered from the tyranny of sin.


7. "Establish the law."—Where is the law established? Not in God's government or plan; for His law is eternal, whether men believe or disbelieve (see verse 3; Ps. 119:89; 111:7, 8). But the law is established in the heart of the believer, and if he goes on from "faith to faith" it is then written in the heart in all its fullness forever.
