## Notes

1. "I thank God."—Paul carried a burden for souls. He was not among those who could preach a sermon and then lightly "leave it and the people with the Lord." He not only longed for the conversion of souls, but for their growth and progress as well. For this he labored night and day, that he might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. Acts 20:19, 20, 26, 27, 31. He rejoiced, therefore, in the prosperity of the church in wicked, idolatrous Rome.

   "The whole world," that is, the civilized world. Just as far as Rome's dominion extended, so far had gone the fame of the faithful in Rome. See Acts 28:22; Rom. 16:19; 1 Thess. 1:8.


2. "Some spiritual gift"—Vincent remarks that the Greek word for gift, charisma, means "gift of grace, a favor received without merit on the recipient's part. Paul uses it both in this ordinary sense (chapter 5:15, 16; 6:23) and in a special, technical sense, denoting extraordinary powers bestowed upon individuals by the Holy Spirit, such as gifts of healing, speaking with tongues, prophecy, etc. See Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 1:7; 12:4, 31; 1 Peter 4:10. In 1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6, it is used of the sum of the powers requisite for the discharge of the office of our evangelist."—"Word Studies."

   God sometimes imparted these gifts through His ministers, not to satisfy ambition, or to glorify man, but to establish the receiver in the faith. See Acts 8:17; 19:6; 1 Cor. 1:6-8.


3. "Comforted."—It has been suggested that while Paul had not seen Rome, he had met many of the disciples there. This is indicated by the names mentioned in chapter 16. In fact it is quite probable that many members of the congregation in Rome had been converted through the labors of Paul in other places, and had been brought together by a common faith, as is often the case in large, central cities. He would not have them think his previous statement was a reflection upon them, but that the impartation of the gift would be a comfort to both.


4. "Debtor."—Paul was "sold under sin," a bond-slave, powerless to help or save himself. The Lord Jesus bought him, redeemed him, purchased him with His own precious blood. Paul belonged to Christ. But Christ died for all, and made a way whereby all might be saved. Therefore Paul, the purchased, became debtor to do the work of Christ to the fullest extent of his ability and power. Being through Christ debtor to all, Paul was as ready to preach the gospel in Rome as in Jerusalem. No race or national prejudices can limit the soul which has been baptized into the life and love of Christ.

   "We owe a great debt and it is long overdue! 'I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians,' said Paul. What had he received of them?—Absolutely nothing. But he had what they needed and must have, and he had met that need. We have in our hand a pardon for a man condemned, and we are his debtor until we put it in his hand. It was for this purpose that we received it, and with it went the message, Go quick anywhere!"—"Pastoral and Personal Evangelism," page 52.


5. "Not ashamed."—There are many things for which human beings ought to be ashamed, but are not. Drinking, smoking, profanity, filthiness, gossip, talebearing, broken promises, falsehood, ill feelings toward others, malice, envy, folly, and a multitude of other sins, are things of which gospel-enlightened, judgment-bound people ought to be ashamed. Of the opposite of these one ought never to be ashamed. Who ever heard of one ashamed of being honest, upright, clean, sober, temperate, and true? But it is just such a character as this that the gospel will develop. Why should one be ashamed of the gospel? Paul was ready to preach the gospel because he was not ashamed of it.


6. "The Gospel."—The word "gospel" means "good tidings." So the angel calls it in Luke 2:10. See also Isa. 52:7. God designed that His message of salvation should ever be "good tidings" to those in sin, in helplessness, and in the shadow of death. The powerlessness of men to help themselves was seen in the wickedness of the world in the apostle's day, and set forth in this book. The gospel came with good tidings of available power, even the power of God. The whole material universe is a witness to this power. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork." Ps. 19:1. The stars rolling on their sublime courses is a manifestation of God's power. "For that He is strong in power; not one faileth." Isa. 40:26. The gospel of God is the good tidings to every soul that this same power is pledged to the salvation of the sinful, the hopeless, the helpless. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. It comes not to crush but to lift up, not to destroy but to save.


7. "To every one."—There is no exception to this. All may be recipients of God's power, if they will but believe His word and submit to His will. Those who make a free channel for His power, whether Jew or Gentile, will receive strength for every need.


8. "From faith to faith."—Faith is more than mere belief or assent to a statement. Faith accepts God's forgiveness, or God's covering righteousness, for all past sins. We are justified from sin by faith only. And the faith that accepts this renounces sin and accepts the power of the life of God for holy living, and a new heart which that life creates. The old life of the believer is changed for the life of Christ, and the Father sees upon the sinner only the righteousness of the Divine.
