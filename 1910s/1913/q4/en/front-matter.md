## Introductory Note

The epistle of Paul to the Romans is placed first of all among his writings, because of its great doctrinal importance. It probably was written in Corinth in the spring of A.D. 57 or 58. It is one of the most systematic and comprehensive of religious treatises and withal a mighty appeal. It sets forth man's sinful and lost condition, whatever his race or pretension, his hopelessness without God, and God's mercy in justification through Christ Jesus. It shows how God can be just, and yet justify the believing sinner; not that he may continue in sin, but that he may develop a sinless, Christian character. While a profound book, it is not difficult for the heart of faith to apprehend.


Study the book, its chapters, its sections, its verses, its clauses, its phrases, its words. Do not hurry. Do not seek to give a whole verse for an answer to a question when a word will suffice. Use only that part of the Scripture necessary to answer the question. Get all you can out of the words of life. Review often. Remember the "therefores" and "wherefores;" and find the reasons for their use. May the study of this wonderful epistle bring the multiplied blessings of faith to all.
