## Notes

1. "Much every way."—Surely it is of great advantage to have access to all the wonderful truth and teaching of God throughout the centuries, from the time of the Promised Seed till our Lord's first advent. But chief among these advantages to the Jews were the holy precepts and oracles of God, which were entrusted to them, all of which were inseparably interwoven with the gospel.


2. "Let God be true."—The thought of the text is not that we shall ascribe truth to God at all hazards, whether He speaks truth or not; but that God speaks truth always and forever, whatever man may say or do. The great fact should be recognized, that God is the very truth itself. Then will we discern truth in His words, righteousness in His acts, justice in His judgment.


3. All things shall work finally to God's glory. Even the wicked, by doing as God declares they will, by reaping the fruits He declares they will reap, are thus commending the truthfulness and the righteousness of God. The psalmist declares, "The wrath of man shall praise Thee." Nor is God unrighteous, who punishes the wicked. They are only reaping the fruit of that which they have sown.


4. "All under sin."—All are condemned by sin. Man, by nature and apart from Christ, is its slave. For proof of his statements the apostle quotes from the Holy Scriptures.


5. By a series of quotations from the Scriptures, which the Jews held to be sacred, the apostle proved the sinfulness, depravity, and helplessness of humanity. These scriptures speak of the world without Christ, not of God's devoted people.
