## Notes

1. "Until the law."—These words do not mean that there was no law before God spoke His law at Sinai, but "until the law" was given in written form at that time. As God imputed sin to Adam in the garden, there must have been a law.


2. "Death reigned."—That the law existed previous to Sinai is shown by the fact that death reigned from the time that Adam sinned. But sin is the transgression of God's law. 1 John 3:4; Rom. 7:7. Therefore God's law existed unchangeably from the beginning. Every commandment of the Decalogue may be traced either in its observance or transgression previous to Sinai. Apart from law there is no transgression, therefore if no law was given to man before the Decalogue was spoken from Mount Sinai, there were no sinners previous to that time, for there was no law to transgress. But death reigned, and therefore there was sin, and being sin, a law.


3. "A figure."—Adam was the head and father of the fleshly race, which follow him into sin and death. Christ Jesus is the head of the spiritual race of men, which follow Him in righteousness and life.


4. The free gift is not to be compared to the trespass. In that one trespass Satan thought to destroy the race forevermore, but the unspeakable gift of Jesus Christ, the grace of God that was manifest in Him, abounded unto the many over the trespass. The one trespass led to many sins, the one free gift brought deliverance and victory over many trespasses. The glory of God's grace is triumphant over all the multiplied powers of sin.


5. The unreserved giving of Himself by Jesus Christ involved and included in principle all His righteous life. The one giving of all things brought life and justification to all men, and it has ever been the privilege of all men to lay hold of them.


6. "Much more."—We not infrequently hear persons say, "If I but possessed the nature Adam did before he fell I might win the victory." But if we could be victorious then, we can now. God was to Adam no more than He is now to Adam's sons and daughters. Above all the abounding sin is the superabounding grace.
