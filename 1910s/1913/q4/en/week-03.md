## Notes

1. "Hold the truth in unrighteousness."—Not to hold the truth in the sense of possessing it, for no man really possesses the truth who is unrighteous. The Revised Version gives the correct sense, "hold down," that is, to hinder or repress the truth. They do not receive the truth into their lives, and by the false profession, often hinder it from reaching other lives.


2. "Manifested."—God's power and influence are manifested in men, in conscience, in judgment, in reason, in love, in a desire after holiness. His wisdom and power are manifest unto men in sun and stars, in wood and field, in sea and land, in rock and plain, in all His works. And the manifestation of His invisible power in visible things, enables thoughtful men to grasp the love, righteousness, and life of God.


3. "Invisible things."—There is always enough light and truth for one step more. All the visible things of God that are manifest to us argue for the invisible perfections of God which we can not see, even His eternal power to save, His divine, everlasting love.


4. "Heart was darkened."—Darkness does not come from God. "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all." Our path becomes darkened when we turn from the light and interpose our own shadow between our pathway and God. Those who knew God might have retained Him in their hearts, and glorified Him. But instead, by taking glory to themselves, they shut away God's glory, and their foolish heart was darkened. "He that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth."


5. "Gave them up."—When men will not have God, He permits them to have their own way; He leaves them to the power and fruitage of the sin they have chosen.


6. "Changed the truth."—The Revised Version reads, "For that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie." Godet instead of "changed" gives "travestied." Conybeare and Howson say, "This is nearly a quotation from Ps. 106:20 (Septuagint); the phrase used there and here meaning to forsake one thing for another, to change one thing against another." They utterly perverted the truth of God to degrading, debasing lies. Vincent says that "the truth of God" is equivalent to "the true God." They made of the true God a lie in their own hearts; they travestied His truth, and turned from His infinite perfections to the worship of the lowest and basest. Their gods were their passions personified. They "passed by" the Creator. The Revised Version reads they worship the creature "rather than" the Creator. They deliberately chose sin instead of God.


7. "Gave them up."—The expressions in these verses are terrible in their intensity, and ought to help us to see what it means to cast off God. Bengel remarks, "In stigmatizing we must often call a spade a spade. The unchaste usually demand from others an absurd modesty." Yet Paul's reserve is in strong contrast with the freedom of pagan writers. See Eph. 5:12. "Men gave not God thanks, gave not God reverence, gave not God obedience; therefore God gave them up to their own awful way."—Vincent.
