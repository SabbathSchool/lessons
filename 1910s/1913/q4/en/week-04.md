## Notes

1. "Gave them over."—This is the third time this expression has appeared in this chapter. God gave them up to uncleanness, to a reprobate mind, a mind void of judgment, with no power to see, or choose the right. The reprobate mind is the last stage of evil.


2. "To do those things."—Every kind of mind bears its fruitage. The reprobate mind leads inevitably to the doing of those things which are "not fitting," as given in the Revised Version.


3. "Filled with all unrighteousness."—The list of sins which are given are manifestations of unrighteousness. Study them; they may not belong to the heathen world alone. "Fornication," transgression of the seventh commandment, which may be in cherished thought. "Wickedness," dangerous, destructive sin. "Covetousness," greed, "the sinful desire which goes out after things of time and sense of every form and kind." "Idolatry." "Covetousness and impurity may be said to divide between them nearly the whole domain of selfishness and vice."—Lightfoot. "Maliciousness," baseness, badness, malice, ill will, a disposition to do evil. "Full of envy," filled with ill feeling toward those who seem better circumstanced than ourselves. "Murder," hatred cherished in the heart which leads to murder. "Debate," "to beat down," strife. "Deceit," living a lie. "Malignity," a malicious, actively hating disposition. "Whisperers," those who make trouble (Prov. 16:28), tattlers, talebearers.


4. "Backbiters,"—detractors of character, those who say evil things against the person not present. "Haters of God," not only feeling but showing hatred, hating God because of His character. "Despiteful," insolent, arrogant. "Boasters," vain boasting of shallow things, "swaggerers." "Inventors of evil things," "inventors of vices" (Rotherham), new ways of sinning. "Disobedient to parents," the beginning of a life of disobedience.


5. "Without understanding."—God gave them up to such a condition. "Covenant-breakers," those who will not keep their word. Failure to keep one's word is a marked feature in the commercial, political, and social worlds. "Without natural affection," no true love for one's own kin, affection perverted by lust and selfishness. "Implacable," stubborn in enmity, that which will not be reconciled, in need of mercy but unmerciful. What an awful list of sins,—twenty-two in number! They are descriptive of the heathen world today. But they are not confined there.


6. A similar list of sins is found in 2 Tim. 3:1-5, and is there applied to the professed children of God in the last days. These sins are but the product of the natural, unregenerate heart, and can be restrained only by the power of God. The gospel is the only remedy for this condition.


7. "They which commit such things."—Rotherham renders this verse: "Who, indeed, having acknowledged the righteous sentence of God, that they who do such things as these do practice are worthy of death, not only the same things are doing, but are even delighting together with them who are practicing them."
