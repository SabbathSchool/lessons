## Notes

1. "Hath whereof to glory."—If one is saved by his own efforts he surely can glory in himself. But the apostle adds, "but not before God," for the apostle had before proved that all, both Jews and Gentiles, are under sin. There can be no self-glorification in God's presence.


2. Though Abraham could not understand how the promise God made could be fulfilled, yet he believed the word of God. And God counted the faith he had righteousness. Abraham was therefore made righteous by faith only and not works. In like manner are all the children of Abraham justified from sin.

   "A check, though signed by the richest man, will not do any good unless one has faith to present it. The doctor can not cure a man who will not trust him enough to take his medicines and obey his directions. A guide can not lead us through the forest unless we believe him enough to follow him."—Peloubet.


3. "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope." Abraham believed God, believed His promise, His power, His love. His faith was reckoned unto him as the righteousness of God. Even so it is reckoned unto us if we believe. Abraham is set forth as an example as the father of all them that believe. By the same faith in Christ we become his children.
