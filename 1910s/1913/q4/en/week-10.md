## Notes

1. "Heir of the world."—This is the ultimate of God's promise in both type and declaration. The earth was given to man in the beginning. Gen. 1:26; Ps. 115:16. Adam lost it through sin, but our Lord bought it back by sacrifice. Luke 19:10. The holy seed are to inherit it, of whom the preeminent One is Christ Jesus our Lord. The usurper possesses it for a time, for man by transgression lost to the enemy the dominion given him in Eden. Gen. 3:6, 7; Luke 4:5, 6. But the Seed will at last crush the serpent's head and cleanse the kingdom. Gen. 3:15; Rom. 16:20. This was promised to Abraham repeatedly. After his great test he was told that his seed should possess the gate—the place of judgment and power—of his enemies. Gen. 22:16-18. And all this will be wrought out through Christ when He comes again. At the close of the 1,000 years of Revelation 20 the saints will possess the earth made new, and God's will will be done on earth as in heaven.


2. "Of the law" and "through the law" means through the works of the law. If man could earn his inheritance, what need would there be of faith? There would be no need of God's promise, if man could work out his own salvation. But man can neither work righteousness, nor earn his inheritance, for he is a sinner "without strength."


3. "Worketh wrath."—God did not give the law for this purpose; it was "ordained to life." Gravitation is a beneficent force. It holds things stable and in equilibrium on the earth. But if man should hurl himself from a high cliff, the force of gravitation would prove his destruction. Electricity in proper channels may be and is one of the most useful agents in the world today, but misdirected it proves destructive. The heart in harmony with God's law finds it a lamp to the feet and a light to the path; but the heart set against that law finds its working condemnation and death.


4. "No law—no transgression."—There has been transgression in this world since Adam sinned. There must therefore have been law. And as sin has ever been against our heavenly Father, the law transgressed must be God's law. And as the sin has been universal, so far as man is concerned, the law must be a universal law.


5. "Of faith."—The promise must be appropriated by faith. If the Jew could work out his salvation by works, he would boast in himself. The Gentile would, if able so to do, boast in himself. But faith puts all upon the same basis, both Jew and Gentile. When it is all of faith, to God will be all the glory.


6. "Who quickeneth the dead."—"Who giveth life to the dead" (A.R.V.). All that is in God's purpose is to Him a reality. All those who sleep in Him are counted as living, because in His purpose they live. He calleth things that are not as though they were, because in His purpose they are, and when He speaks they exist.


7. "Our Justification."—All the promises and blessings of the past and the present center in our blessed Lord. He died to deliver us from our sins, from our trespasses against Him. He was raised for our justification to righteousness, to life and power. All this was written for our sake, that we might hope in Him.
