## Notes

1. "We have peace."—Faith sees the holiness of God's law, sees sin as evil, denies self, and confesses and renounces sin. Faith yields all to God, and lays hold of the righteousness of God in the place of sin. Then there is peace. Peace is not merely a feeling; it is more; it is a condition. When the soul surrenders to God, there is peace. God has naught against us, and if the enmity of the carnal heart is yielded to Him, whether there is feeling or not, whether in joy or sadness, there is peace. Peace abides. It is found in Christ, and if Christ is ours we have peace.


2. "Have access."—Through faith we have entrance to the great treasures of God's grace. Faith in Christ admits us into the audience-chamber of the Most High, and introduces us, also, into God's marvelous storehouse of riches. Through Christ we may enter and partake freely of all things.


3. "Tribulation."—The English word comes from the old Latin word tribulum, a thrashing instrument, used to pound out the grain. The Greek word means to squeeze, or press. So God permits the pounding, the thrashing, the squeezing, to separate the chaff, to press out the choice wine, or oil of rich experience. Only in trial and tribulation can we obtain experience; only in the testing of experience can we obtain hope. Therefore let us rejoice in tribulation.


4. "The love of God."—The love of God is what many long for. They desire to serve God; but confess that they do not love Him nor His service. They are trying to do this by human effort, which is doomed to failure. The love of God is of heavenly birth, and must be fed on heavenly manna. Do we really desire it? It comes by the indwelling of His Spirit. Do we desire the Spirit? "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?" Luke 11:9-13.


5. There are times in the experience of every child of God when the sense of our lost, awful condition almost overwhelms us, and we are tempted to feel that there is no hope for us. But be of good courage. It was for sinners, for the most ungodly, that Jesus died, for those who are lost, who have strayed the farthest from the Father's house. Every returning prodigal will find a welcome and a father's blessing.


6. "Atonement."—"Reconciliation" is given in the margin and Revised Version. Surely there is reason to be joyful in God. It was while we were enemies that He died to save us. Much more when reconciled we shall be saved by His life. When reconciliation to Him brings all the blessings named, and gives access to all the blessings we need, why should not our hearts be filled with thanksgiving to God?
