5. "We see, from the above letter, that Titus was desired to join St. Paul at Nicopolis, where the apostle designed to winter. We learn from an incidental notice elsewhere, that the route he pursued was from Ephesus to Miletus, where his old companion Trophimus remained behind from sickness, and thence to Corinth, where he left Erastus, the former treasurer of that city, whom, perhaps, he had expected, or wished, to accompany him in his farther progress. The position of Nicopolis would render it a good center for operating upon the surrounding province; and thence St. Paul might make excursions to those churches of Illyr-icum which lie perhaps founded himself at an earlier period. The city which was thus chosen as the last scene of the apostle's labors, before his final imprisonment, is more celebrated for its origin than for its subsequent history. It was founded by Au-gustus, as a permanent memorial of the victory of Actium, and stood upon the site of the camp occupied by his land forces bfore that battle."â€”"Life and Epistles of St. Paul," Conyb. eare and Howson, People's Edition, page
