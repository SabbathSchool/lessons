# Destructive Pests; A Call to Mourning

**Lesson Scripture**: Joel 1: 1-13

## Questions

1. When, probably, did Joel prophesy? 

6. How many generations are mentioned? 

8. What would be the experience of the self-indul- gent? 

## Notes

1. There are no definite statements in the prophecy of Joel which furnish a basis for determining with any exactness the time when this book was written. The great subject of the prophecy is the "day of the Lord," an expression which is repeated several times; and although the warnings and exhortations doubtless had an application to the people of Judah at the time when they were written, yet, they look onward to the events connected with the day of the Lord. It seems altogether probable that Joel prophesied toward the end of the kingdom of Judah, when the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonish captivity were impending events. They would then serve as a sort of background for that complete destruction which awaits unrepentant sinners at the end of the world.

5. The awful desolations of a nation hostile to God's people are here vividly portrayed.
