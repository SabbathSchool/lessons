# Gathering the Nations; The Day of
AUGUST 2, 1913

**Lesson Scripture**: Joel 3: 1-10

## Questions

6. What wicked cities does the prophet mention? What would the Lord speedily bring upon these oppress-ors of His people? 

## Notes

1. "The following prophecy relates to the latter times of the world.... Since all nations are summoned to answer the im-peachment here mentioned, we may suppose the word 'Israel' to comprehend the faithful of all ages; and then we may observe that the judgments denounced against the church's enemies, are chiefly for their hatred and cruelty against His servants."— Scott.

2. ''The enemies of the Jews took them captives and enslaved them. Yet they valued them so little that they made them the stake in games of chance; nay, they used to sell a boy or girl into perpetual bondage, for the hire of a harlot, or for wine to make them drunk."— Scott.

5. The Septuagint and the German version read Sanctify war; and as will be seen by the marginal reading of the Revised Ver-sion, this is the meaning of the Hebrew original.

6. As is indicated by the marginal dates, Isaiah and Micah prophesied later than Joel. This declaration from the mouth of the Lord telling the world war was coming was given about one half a century before we were told concerning the false predic-tion of peace and safety that the people, the nations, would make while the most gigantic preparations for war are being made. The warlike preparation of the nations to-day is on so vast a scale that it can not be adequately expressed in figures. Navies and standing armies are being increased more rapidly than ever before. The nations are waking up and preparing for war. The world is one vast arsenal, and none can tell when a spark will be kindled that will result in an international explosion. All about us we see evidences that the time foretold by the prophet Joel is at hand.

7. The cry of peace, safety, and stability of the things around us is of itself a striking sign that the end is near. The people are crying peace,— the settlement of national disputes by arbitration. But the preparation for slaughter goes on, and the mustering for Armageddon is heard.
