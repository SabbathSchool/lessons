## Notes

1. Sanctify—"To set apart as holy or for holy purposes; con-secrate; hallow; as the Sabbath was sanctified by God."—" Stand-ard Dictionary."

3. "It is just with God to take away those comforts which are abused to luxury and excess, to recover the corn and wine which are prepared for Baal, which are made the food and fuel of a base lust. And to them endowments of that kind are most grievous. The more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more pressing temporal afflictions are upon them. The drinke rs of water needed not to care when the vine was laid waste, they could live as well without it as they had done; it was no trouble for the Nazarites; but the drinkers of wine will weep and howl. The more delights we make necessary to our satisfac-tion, the more we expose ourselves to trouble and disappointment." — Matthew Henry.

4. As the sounding of the trumpet anciently was a signal for the chosen people of God to move on together toward the land of promise, so now the call to "blow the trumpet" is a call to the people of God to make a mighty forward movement through all the earth with 'a warning message so solemn and terrible that all the inhabitants of the world should tremble.
