# Christian Servants; Looking for His
SEPTEMBER 6, 1913

**Lesson Scripture**: Titus 2: 9-15

## Questions

2. What further instruction is given to servants? Why should they be thus careful in their conduct? 

## Notes

1. The word here translated "answering again" is given in other passages as "contradicting," which is its true meaning. The Revised Version gives the word "gainsaying." It might be interesting to note that the word "masters" in this text is from the Greek word "despot." But this word is, in the Septuagint, sometimes applied to the Lord Himself, and does, not originally mean an oppressive ruler.

2. The expression "not purloining" is translated by Rother-ham, "not keeping [anything] back." The French version gives it, "not misappropriating anything that belongs to their masters."

6. Paul gives the same exhortation to Timothy as to Titus to let no man despise him, and he tells Timothy how to do this. It is by taking such a commendable course as to live above re-proach. "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." When teachers of religion dishonor their pro-fession by doing the things against which they warn others, they may expect to be despised. These young apostles were liable not to be fully appreciated; so Paul wrote the church, concerning this matter, that they should not despise young workers who were doing the work of the Lord the same as the older veterans. "Does any man inquire what is the duty of a gospel minister'? Send him to the second chapter of the epistle to Titus for a com-plete answer. There he will find what he is to believe, what he is to practise, and what he is to preach. Even his congregation is parceled out to him. The old and the young of both sexes, and those who are in their employment, are considered to be the objects of his ministry; and a plan of teaching in reference to those different descriptions of society is laid down before him." â€” Adam Clarke.
