2. ''Valley of• decision" is rendered in the Septuagint "valley of judgment." The German translation is the same, the valley of judgment.

4. "But amid the tempest of divine judgment, the children of God will have no cause for fear. 'The Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.' The day that brings terror and destruction to the transgressors of God's law, will bring to the obedient, 'joy unspeakable, and full of glory.' 'Gather My saints together unto Me,' saith the Lord, 'those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge Himself.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page

2. What hope did Paul cherish? According to whose promise When had this promise been made? How sure is the promise of God? Verse

5. Why had Paul left Titus in Crete? Verse

13. What should he love? What other traits of character are necessary? Verse

17. How will sound doctrine be received in the last days?

1. Paul was the servant of God, and an apostle of Christ. The former was his general character, the latter his special em-ployment. His apostolical office accorded with the faith of God's elect, and was intended to bring numbers to believe in Christ.

3. In a note on this verse "Conybeare and Howson" says, "Not simply 'set in order,' but set in order farther." Paul no doubt, so far as time had permitted, established order and system among the churches here, but desiring that this work should be perfected, left Titus to finish the work. It was the aim of the great apostle, not alone in Crete, but everywhere, to leave order and perfect organization behind him.
