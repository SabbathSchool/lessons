612. "Let Christians put away their dissensions, and give them-selves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them in faith ask for the Messing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result. But the 'latter rain' will be more abundant. "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, will be constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their com-mand. Christ gives them the breath, of His own spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and mul-tiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls."—"Desire of Ages," page

3. "The locusts in Languedoc were about an inch in length, and of a gray color. The earth in some places was covered four inches thick with them in the morning, before the heat of the sun was considerable; but as soon as it began to grow hot, they took wing, and fell upon the corn, eating up both leaf and ear; and that with such expedition, by reason of their number, that in three hours they would devour a whole field. After which they again took wing, and their swarms were so thick that they covered the sun like a cloud, and were whole hours in passing. After having eaten up the corn they fell upon the vines, the pulse the willows, and even the hemp, notwithstanding its great bitterness."— "Scott's Commentary."
