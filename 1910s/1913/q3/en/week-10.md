2. "We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of God, we must obey God rather than man. God's word must be recognized as above all human legislation. A 'Thus saith the Lord' is not to be set aside for a Thus saith the church' or a Thus saith the state.' The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly potentates. "We are not required to defy, authorities. Our words, whether spoken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place ourselves on record as uttering that which would make us appear antagonistic to law and order. We are not to say or, do anything that would unnecessarily close up our way."—"Acts of the Apos-tles," page

69. "We would also humbly represent that the only proper objects of civil government are the happiness and protection of men in the present state of existence; the security of the life, liberty, and property of the citizens; and to restrain the vicious and to encourage the virtuous by wholesome laws equally extended to every individual: but the duty that we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can only be directed by reason and conviction, and is nowhere cognizable but at the tribunal of the universal Judge. To judge for ourselves, and to engage in the exercise of religion agreeably to the dictates of our own con-science, is an inalienable right, which, upon the principles on Which the gospel was first propagated, and the reformation from popery carried on, can never be transferred to another."— From Memorial of the Presbytery of Hanover to the General Assembly of Virginia, quoted in "American State Papers," page

4. The word translated "sometimes" in the text and "once" in the American Revised Version, in harmony with former usage, here means formerly. We are to consider not only what manner of persons we ought to be, but also what manner of persons we used to be.

5. "Righteousness conies before holiness in the order of re-demption, the one being imputed to us on the ground of our faith, and the other being imparted to us by the operation of the Holy Spirit."—"The Twofold Life," page
