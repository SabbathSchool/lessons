## Note

The Levitical priesthood was not an end, but a means. There was no spiritual efficacy in the ceremonies of the ancient ritual, and salvation could not be secured by following the duties prescribed in the Mosaic law. This whole system was intended to reveal Christ and His salvation to the people. To those who discerned this purpose, and looked beyond the type to the reality, a present salvation was just as real an experience as is possible since Christ was manifested in the flesh.
