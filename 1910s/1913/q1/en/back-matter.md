# The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering

The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for this quarter will benefit two extremely needy fields.

## KOREA

A very urgent call comes from Korea for $6,500 for the school work and the building of a hospital. The present school building at Soonan, which cost about four hundred dollars, is entirely inadequate to accommodate the school. The houses that the girls live in are used for the girls' school. In a room eight by twelve feet, from six to eight girls sleep at night, and live in the daytime, eating, studying, and reciting therein. The students are limited to the number that, lying side by side, can find sleeping space on the floor. Such congested conditions are unpleasant, insanitary, and positively dangerous if a student is ill. How happy we should all be for the privilege the Sabbath-schools have of answering this call!

## THE PHILIPPINES

As more will be given on this thirteenth Sabbath than is asked for in the special call from Korea, it has been decided to place with it an imperative need in the Philippines; namely, the establishment of a mission headquarters at Manila. A little band of workers has been placed in that field, and the development and organization of the work demands a center â€” a "headquarters." The estimated cost is $4,000. Our Sabbath-schools can easily supply this.

If a larger amount is given than is needed to meet these calls, the surplus will go to the missionary work in these fields.

Let us pray for the work in Korea and the Philippines as we make this offering to the Lord's work.
