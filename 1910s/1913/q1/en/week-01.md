## Notes

1. In the first chapter of the Bible, God is revealed as the Creator. The test by which the true God may be known is here furnished, and the foundation is laid for the true gospel. This record of the creative work was not introduced into the Scriptures in order to teach physical science, but because redemption is a work of creation, and only He who created the heavens and the earth, and man in His image, in the first place, can create a new man in Christ Jesus, and new heavens and a new earth. That hope which rests upon any other basis is a false hope.

2. The gospel of the restoration which is proclaimed in Isaiah, chapters 40-66, opens with an appeal to God as the Creator, repeats this appeal many times, and closes with the prophecy of the creation of the new heavens and the new earth. It fully sets forth the gospel of the re-creation.

3. The fact that salvation from sin can be accomplished only through a new creation, is fully recognized in the New Testament; and in the closing part of the last book, a description is given of the new heavens and the new earth, and the new Jerusalem.

4. He alone can save and deliver who can create, and therefore believers should find encouragement in contemplating the creative works of God, and should put their confidence in the Creator alone. No created being can save the soul from death or send deliverance in time of trouble.
