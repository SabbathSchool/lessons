## Notes

1. All the services of the earthly sanctuary had reference to the law of God which was in the ark under the mercy-seat. The work of Christ as a priest in the heavenly sanctuary, which was foreshadowed in the earthly sanctuary and its services, was to "make reconciliation for the sins of the people," and "sin is the transgression of the law." By His death on the cross, Jesus became the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and "through faith in His blood" remission of sins is obtained. Jesus is also the Mediator of the new covenant; and through His ministry as the great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, the law of God is written in the heart; and the repentant sinner is enabled to live a life in obedience to that law. Thus the work of Christ is not to set aside the law, but to bring the life of the believer into harmony with it. This is the real gospel.

2. The covenant was not the Law of God, but it "was simply an arrangement for bringing men again into harmony with the divine will, placing them where they could obey God's law."
