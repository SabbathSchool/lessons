## Notes

1. The services of the earthly sanctuary were designed to reveal to the people the gospel of Christ, the Saviour from sin. Whenever they degenerated into mere formalism, and took the place of repentance and faith, they became an abomination in the sight of God. Nothing less than heart service was acceptable to Him. The performance of certain gospel ordinances is no excuse for sin; they are rather intended as a means of helping the sinner to lay hold upon Him who saves from sin.

2. The happiness of all God's creatures depends upon their being in perfect harmony with His will. The purpose of the gospel is to make believers "perfect in every good work to do His will." This required that Christ should "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself," and that He should become the Mediator of the new covenant in order that the law of God might be written in the heart.

3. The contrast in Heb. 10:8, 9 is between the performing of a ritual service and the performing of the will of God. This is plainly indicated in Rotherham's translation: "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin Thou willedst not. . . . Behold! I am come to do Thy will." The sacrifices and offerings for sin, which God did not design as a substitute for doing His will, constitute "the first," which was taken away; while the doing of God's will constitutes "the second," which He came to establish.

4. Christ took the flesh, and became a doer of the will of God, not in order that man should be excused from doing that will, but in order to provide a way by which it would be possible for man to do the will of God, or keep His law. Through that faith which brings one into vital union with Christ, and which accepts the blessings that come through His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, the believer is empowered to do the will of God.

5. The thunders of Sinai, and the voice which spoke the law that demanded perfection of character, meant only condemnation apart from the mediatorial work of the Son of God. The ministry of our great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary means reconciliation to God, and forgiveness through the blood of sprinkling, and the fulfilment of the new covenant promises.
