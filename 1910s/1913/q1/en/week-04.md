## Notes

1. Although the priests appointed under the Levitical system were compassed with infirmity and subject to death, yet they served "that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things," and their priesthood was typical of the priesthood of the Son of God. They did not represent any other created being, but only Him who was made a priest "after the power of an endless life," even "Jesus the Son of God."

2. Jesus did not become a priest by a merely arbitrary appointment. He could enter upon His work as priest in behalf of sinful men because He was the eternal Son of God, and the Scripture recognized this fact by making the declaration concerning His sonship the basis of the oath which appointed Him to the priesthood. When the Lord declared Jesus to be His Son, He established the basis of the priesthood.

3. From the description given in the first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, it is perfectly clear that no created being could be "a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man." Any interpretation of the Scriptures, therefore, which requires that some other person than the Son of God should at any time minister in the heavenly sanctuary, must be discarded as being untrue to the inspired explanation of the typical priesthood.
