## Notes

1. "These words ['the son of perdition'] are used as a name in one other place of the New Testament, and are applied not to an infidel power, but to a Christian apostle, Judas. John 17:12. They may therefore be fitly applied to a Christian bishop, a successor of the apostles, if he betrays Christ. And if the bishop of Rome be unfaithful to the trust he has received from Christ, they may well be applied to him."—Bishop Wordsworth.

2. "It has been said, indeed, that this description in verse 4 is not fulfilled in the papacy, and represents a degree of pride and blasphemy far beyond what can be imputed to it. This objection has arisen in a great measure from non-attention to the words of the original. They do not import that the 'man of sin' exalts himself above [as in the Authorized Version] every one that is called God, but that he exalts himself exceedingly against [as in the Revised Version] every one that is so called."—Bishop Wordsworth.

3. "That Paul's 'mystery of iniquity,' as described in 2 Thess. 2:7, has its counterpart in the Church of Rome, no man of candid mind, who has carefully examined the subject, can easily doubt. Such was the impression made by that account on the mind of the great Sir Matthew Hale, no mean judge of evidence, that he used to say that if the apostolic description were inserted in the public Hue and Cry [an English police bulletin describing criminals and calling for their arrest], any constable in the realm would be warranted in seizing, wherever he found him, the bishop of Rome as the head of that 'mystery of iniquity.'"—"The Two Babylons," Hislop, page 4.

4. In many of the prophecies symbols are employed, but here the predictions are expressed in plain and literal language. While it is evident that papal Rome is the subject of the prophecy, it is equally evident that it is papal Rome as an ecclesiastical power, rather than as a political power. There is to be "a falling away"; divine honors are to be paid to the "man of sin"; he will be enthroned "in the temple of God"; he is the revelation of the "mystery of iniquity." These expressions, taken together with the general trend of the prophecy, warrant us in expecting that a counterfeit church would arise which would substitute a false worship for the true, and exalt a man to take the place of God as revealed in Christ. This literal prophecy, standing between the symbolic prophecies of Daniel and John, points out so clearly the false system which they more fully describe, that there need be no difficulty in correctly applying them.
