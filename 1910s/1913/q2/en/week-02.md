# Lesson 2 — Ancient and Modern Babylon
APRIL 12, 1913

## General Note

The purpose of this lesson is to show that ancient Babylon is a type of modern Babylon, the papacy, and that therefore the history of ancient Babylon, as it is recorded in the Scriptures, is a prophetic history which will find its counterpart in a general way in modern Babylon, the Church of Rome. After the relation between the two Babylons has been thus established, the history of ancient Babylon will be a decided help in arriving at a correct interpretation of some of the prophecies which deal with the rise and work of the papacy. It is significant that although the first three of the four universal kingdoms are designated by their historical names in the Scriptures, the name Rome is never applied to the fourth kingdom. The explanation seems to be that the political kingdoms which followed ancient Babylon were, so far as the prophecies are concerned, regarded simply as historical links which connect ancient Babylon with modern Babylon.

## Notes

1. A woman is used in prophecy as a symbol of the church—a pure woman, of the true church; and a corrupt woman, of an apostate church. See 2 Cor. 11:2; and Ezekiel 16 and 23. In this instance, the woman riding upon the beast with seven heads and ten horns represents the apostate Church of Rome exercising a controlling influence in the Roman state.

2. "Her name 'Mystery' can imply no less than that she dealeth in 'mysteries'; her religion is a mystery, a mystery of iniquity; and she herself is mystically and spiritually Babylon the great. But the title of 'mystery' is in no respect proper to ancient Rome, more than any other city; and neither is there any mystery in substituting one heathen, idolatrous, and persecuting city for another; but it is indeed a mystery that a Christian city, professing and boasting herself to be the city of God, should prove another Babylon in idolatry and cruelty to the people of God. She glories in the name 'Roman Catholic,' and well therefore may she be called 'Babylon the great.' She affects the style and title of 'our holy mother the church,' but she is in truth the mother of fornications and abominations of the earth. Neither can this character with any propriety be applied to ancient Rome; for she was rather a learner of foreign superstitions than the mistress of idolatry to other nations."—"Newton on the Prophecies," pages 641, 642.

3. "The protest of the Reformers... was against the principle of Catholicism, which is idolatry, or the substitution of material and created things for Christ. For whether it is the mediation of the virgin and saints, or a trust in the guidance of the priesthood and in the spiritual efficacy of the sacraments administered by them, or a belief in the virtue of holy water, holy oil, images, crucifixes, relics, and other material symbols and ritual acts, they one and all combine to take the place of Christ to the sinner, and keep him from going to Him for life."—"The False Christ," Garnier, page 140.

"The holy synod enjoins on all bishops, and others sustaining the office and charge of teaching, that, according to the usage of the Catholic and Apostolic Church, received from the primitive times of the Christian religion, and according to the consent of the holy fathers, and to the decrees of sacred councils, they especially instruct the faithful diligently touching the intercession and invocation of saints; the honor paid to relics; and the lawful use of images: teaching them, that the saints, who reign together with Christ, offer up their own prayers to God for men; that it is good and useful suppliantly to invoke them, and to resort to their prayers, aid, and help, for obtaining benefits from God, through His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who alone is our Redeemer and Saviour; but that they think impiously, who deny that the saints, who enjoy eternal happiness in heaven, are to be invoked; or who assert either that they do not pray for men; or that the invocation of them to pray for each of us even in particular, is idolatry; or, that it is repugnant to the word of God; and is opposed to the honor of the one Mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus."—Council of Trent, twenty-fifth session, December, 1563.

"This representative principle, on which the image-worshiper of the popish church founds his justification, pervaded the whole system of the pagan worship. It was this which led the world astray at first, and covered the earth with a race of deities of the most revolting character. Whether it was the heavenly bodies, as in Chaldea, or a class of demigods, as in Greece and Rome, it was the great First Cause that was professedly adored through these symbolizations and substitutes. The vulgar, perhaps, failed to grasp this distinction, or steadily to keep it before them, just as the mass of worshipers in the Roman Catholic Church fail practically to apprehend the difference between praying to and praying before, or rather beyond, the image. But such was the system, and that system the Bible denounced as idolatry; and the same system stands equally condemned when found in a popish cathedral as when found in a pagan temple."—"The Papacy," Wylie, pages 356, 357.

4. "The church has persecuted. Only a tyro in church history will deny that. The Apologists in the days of Roman imperial domination inveighed against persecution, and with Tertullian declared that 'it was no part of religion to persecute religion.' But after the days of Constantine, and under the reign of that first Christian emperor, the attitude of Christians underwent a change, and persecution of pagans took place in many places in the empire. One hundred fifty years after Constantine, the Donatists were persecuted, and sometimes put to death. Against these extreme measures St. Augustine raised his voice; but he was willing that they should be despoiled of their churches and of their goods. Protestants were persecuted in France and Spain with the full approval of the church authorities. We have always defended the persecutions of the Huguenots, and the Spanish Inquisition. Wherever and whenever there is honest Catholicity, there will be a clear distinction drawn between truth and error, and Catholicity and all forms of heresy. When she thinks it good to use physical force, she will use it... But will the Catholic Church give bond that she will not persecute at all? Will she guarantee absolute freedom and equality of all churches and all faiths? The Catholic Church gives no bonds for her good behavior... She has countenanced violence, when more humane measures would have been of more avail. Her children and her clergy have often been carried away by popular passion. But she gives no bonds that such things shall not occur again."—"The Western Watchman," Roman Catholic, December 24, 1908.

5. In only one instance has a church borne the name of a city. The Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Rome are the titles everywhere applied to that apostate church represented by the woman sitting upon the scarlet-colored beast.

6. "Now, as the Babylon of the Apocalypse is characterized by the name of 'Mystery,' so the grand distinguishing feature of the ancient Babylonian system was the Chaldean 'mysteries,' that formed so essential a part of that system. And to these mysteries, the very language of the Hebrew prophet, symbolical though of course it is, distinctly alludes, when he speaks of Babylon as a 'golden cup.' To drink of 'mysterious beverages,' says Salverte, was indispensable on the part of all who sought initiation in these mysteries... Their primary object was to introduce privately, by little and little, under the seal of secrecy and the sanction of an oath, what it would not have been safe all at once and openly to propound."—"The Two Babylons," Hislop, pages 4, 5.
