## Notes

2. Paul shows clearly the two chief sources of the falling away from the purity of the apostolic faith. First, from within the church "shall men arise, speaking perverse things."

3. The Revised Version of this text reads, "He shall think to change the times and the law."

58. "Ques.—Have you any other way of proving that. the church has power to institute festivals of precept? "Ans.—Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her,—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority."— "A Doctrinal Catechism," by the Rev. Stephen Keenan, page

5. According to Justin Martyr, as early as the middle of the second century, some of the Christians, especially in the west and at Rome, were observing Sunday in commemoration of Christ's resurrection. But it was a day of festivity, and had no Sabbatical character at that time, as Sir William Domville testifies: "Centuries of the Christian era passed away before Sunday was observed by the Christian church as a Sabbath. History does not furnish us with a single proof or indication that it was at any time so observed previous to the Sabbatical edict of Constantine in A. D.

7. "Thus do we see upon what grounds the Lord's day stands: on custom first, and voluntary consecration of it to religious meeting; that custom countenanced by the authority of the church of God, which tacitly approved the same; and finally, confirmed and ratified by Christian princes through-out their empires. And as the day for rest from labors, and restraint from business upon that day, [it] received its greatest strength from the supreme magistrate as long as he retained that power which to him belongs; as after from the canons and decrees of councils, the decretals of popes, and orders of particular prelates, when the sole managing of ecclesiastical affairs was committed to them."—Dr. Peter Heylyn, in "History of the Sabbath," third edition, page
