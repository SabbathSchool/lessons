## Notes

1. "God placed man under law, as an indispensable con-dition of his very existence. He was a subject of the divine government, and there can be no government without law." —"Patriarchs and Prophets," page

2. The law which says, "Thou shalt not covet," convicted Paul of sin. The law which forbids murder and adultery was a living, active agency when James wrote his epistle. That law is the Decalogue. Christ did not annul or change it. It is just as effective for a twentieth century sinner of the Chris-tian era. "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul."

3. The work of Christ, then, was not to set aside the claims of the law, but on the contrary, to provide a way whereby the "righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us."

4. Of all known religions, the religion of Christ is the only one which furnishes power to live a righteous life. It is the only religion that is founded in love, and love is the only power that can cope successfully with sin in the life.

10. "As to the method of justification, three things are to be considered: the originating, the meritorious, and the instru-mental causes. The originating cause is the grace of God, which disposed Him, when we were exposed to death as a penalty of our offense, to provide a substitute in His Son. This substitute is the meritorious cause of our justification. What Jesus Christ did in obedience to the precepts of the law, and what He suffered in satisfaction of its penalty, con-stitute the ground of our forgiveness and justification before God. As to the instrumental cause of our justification, the merit of Christ does not operate so as to produce pardon as a necessary and unavoidable effect, but through the instru-mentality of faith."—"Binney's Theological Compendium," page
