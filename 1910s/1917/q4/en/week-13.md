## Notes

1. The true Christian will be temperate in all things. That does not mean a moderate use of that which is hurtful, as some have interpreted it, but total abstinence from those things which are injurious, and a moderate use of those things which are good.

454. ) Dr. B. W. Richardson said: "It is a fact that the large majority of people who are well to do, eat too much food of all kinds. Some eat twice as much as is necessary, and not a few eat four times as much as they really require."— "Ministry of Health," page

4. "Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator. These foods, prepared in as simple and natural a manner as possible, are the most health-ful and nourishing."—"Ministry of Healing," page

5. When there is scarcity of food, as in the days of Noah, it may be necessary to take the life of the lower animal to save the life of man; but the dangers incurred in a flesh diet are increasing rapidly. "Flesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly objectionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increas-ing. Those who use flesh foods little know what they are eating. Often if they could see the animals when living, and know the quality of the meat they eat, they would turn from it with loathing. People are continually eating flesh that is filled with tuberculous and cancerous germs. Tuber-culosis, cancer, and other fatal diseases are thus communi-cated."—Id., page

6. The words "eat in due season" suggest that some re-gard should be paid to the time of eating. "A second meal should never be eaten until the stomach has had time to rest from the labor of digesting the preceding meal." ("How to Live," page

7. When a muscle is not used, it soon becomes soft and flabby, and then wastes away. Nature abhors idleness, and will not support or nourish any organ of the body that is not used. Many beautiful, well made structures, the workman-ship of the hand divine, are literally decaying "by much slothfulness." Proper exercise stimulates the nerve centers, increases circulation, aids digestion, hastens elimination, quickens respiration, purifies the blood, strengthens the muscles, and imparts tone and vigor to the whole man. "Perspire or expire is the law of life."
