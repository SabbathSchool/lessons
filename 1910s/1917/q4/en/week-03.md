## Questions

4. What do the four and twenty elders then say? 

6. How is this anger of the nations connected with the closing scenes of this world's history? Same verse, latter part.

15. Why is the day of Judgment so long deferred? 

16. Though apparently long deferred, what is abso-lutely sure? 

## Notes

1. The vision of Joel presents unparalleled preparation for war. All available resources are taxed to get ready for the conflict. That this is a last-day prophecy, the text itself makes plain. It is "the day of the Lord;" the "harvest is ripe;" the time of the Judgment is at hand.

2. This points to a time when the nations of the world as a whole are greatly stirred. Never was this so emphatically true as at the present time.

3. We are living in the time of the sounding of the seventh angel; and we have been beholding the conditions here de-scribed, for two or three years. The evident fulfillment of this scripture is surely among the latter-day tokens.

4. That this is an age of unparalleled accumulation of wealth, no one will deny. That some of the colossal fortunes amassed in these days have been obtained by fraudulent means is also well known, and that is amply sufficient to fulfill this prophecy. But no one should hold that wealth is in itself sinful, or that all rich men are knaves. Not money, but the love of it, is "the root of all evil." The poor man may love money, and sell his honor to obtain it, as truly as the man with his millions. Another characteristic of this age is wan-tonness, a prodigal expenditure of money. This is seen in almost every department of life.

6. Many persons whose minds have been befogged by evo-lutionary hypotheses and geological speculations refuse to believe that this world was once destroyed by a flood, and so are prepared to discredit the message of Christ's soon coming, and the destruction of the present world by fire. Such will scoff at the advent doctrine. Willful ignorance of the word of God is dangerous ground.
