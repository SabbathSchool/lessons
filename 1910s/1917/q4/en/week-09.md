## Questions

5. In the light of Christ's teaching, what work is for-bidden by the fourth commandment? Ans.—"Thy work."

10. How many times is the first day of the week, com-monly called Sunday, mentioned in the New Testament? To what particular first day do six of these statements refer? 

11. Is the first day of the week ever called the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, or is any sacred title given to it in the New Testament? Does the record indicate that there was any controversy, during the apostolic age, over the day of the Sabbath? 

## Notes

1. "Jesus confirms the Sabbath on its spiritual basis. `The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sab-bath.'... Thus He at once rids it of all the false restric-tions of Judaism, and establishing it upon its primitive foun-dationS, He brought forth its higher reason in the assertion. of the relation to the well-being of man. 'The Sabbath was made for man;' not for Jew only, but for the whole race of mankind; not for one age alone, but for man universally, under every circumstance of time and place."—George Elliott, in "Abiding Sabbath," page

3. The absolute silence of the New Testament on Sunday sacredness must be a great surprise to those who look for evi-dence to justify Sunday observance. Nowhere is any sacred title whatever given to the first day of the week. No precept is given to observe it in any way. No Sabbatic observance of it is anywhere recorded. Nor is there any record of any controversy over the question of which day was the Sabbath during apostolic times. This silence is inexplicable if any such innovation as the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath was growing up in the church during that period.

5. This was not a public collection at the church, as some have conceived. "Lay by him in store, as he may prosper," is the reading of the Revised Version. The following renderings may be useful: "Let each one of you put by itself, treasuring up."—Rotherham. "Let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him."—Douay Version. "The collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, to be prepared for, in private, weekly, and to be ready for trans-mission when he comes."—"Oxford Century Bible."
