## Questions

9. Since the time of Christ, how has man treated God's holy day? 

## Notes

2. Since the apostolic period, the professed church of Christ, like its prototype of old, has substituted the tradi-tions of men for the commandments of God. It has degraded Jehovah's sacred day to a common working-day, and elevated in its place the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times."

3. While this passage applies to the apostasy in ancient Israel, it graphically describes the doings of that dominant ecclesiasticism which ruled Christendom for centuries; and it also pictures what will again take place when the same spirit of apostasy actuates the religious leaders of modern Christendom. This prophecy is rapidly passing into history before our eyes.
