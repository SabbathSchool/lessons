1. In some cases, in this and succeeding lessons, the same texts are cited again and again, as one text may contain answers to several questions. The student should seize upon that part of the text which answers the question most directly.

5. "As one of the signs of Jerusalem's destruction, Christ had said, 'Many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.' False prophets did rise, deceiving the people, and leading great numbers into the desert. Magicians and sor-cerers, claiming miraculous power, drew the people after them into the mountain solitudes. But this prophecy was spoken also for the last days. This sign is given as a sign of the second advent."—"The Desire of Ages," page
