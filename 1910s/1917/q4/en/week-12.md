## Notes

1. This account of Abraham's paying tithe is noteworthy. Before returning to the king of Sodom the spoil taken in battle, which, by common usage, belonged to Abraham as conqueror; before giving his confederates the share that was due to them; before regarding any worldly obligation, he gave to the Lord the tenth of all that had come into his hands. He recognized the priest of God as the lawful custodian of God's share of the spoil, and promptly, and without ques-tion, handed over to him the goods. Time need not be used in unprofitably discussing the ques-tion of who Melchizedek was. The Bible says that he was "king of Salem," and "priest of the most high God." We may well let the matter rest there.

3. God does not need our money, but we greatly need His blessing. We need that development of character which comes only through the cultivation of a liberal spirit. Melchizedek reminded Abraham of the fundamental truth which lies back of the tithing system,—that God is the possessor of heaven and earth. Paying tithes is our recognition of that truth.
