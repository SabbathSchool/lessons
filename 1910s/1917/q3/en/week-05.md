1. "We do not obtain a hundredth part of the blessing we

should obtain from assembling together to worship God."—

"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 362. This state-ment should lead us to a very close and careful study as to

what our conduct in the house of worship should be, in order

to secure the fullness of the promised blessing. It is the pres-ence of the Holy One that makes a place sacred and holy. It

was the presence of God in the burning bush that made the

spot so holy that Moses was bidden to take off his shoes before_

treading upon it.

2. "The church is the sanctuary for the congregation. There should be rules in regard to the time, the place, and the

manner of worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that

pertains to the worship of God, should be treated with care-lessness or indifference.... When the worshipers enter the

place of meeting, they should do so with decorum, passing

quietly to their seats.... Common talking, whispering, and

laughing should not be permitted in the house of worship, either before or after the service.... They'should remember

that heavenly messengers are in the house.... If, when the

people come into the house of worship, they have genuine rev-erence for the Lord, and bear in mind that they are in His

presence, there will be a sweet eloquence in silence. The whis-pering and laughing and talking which might be without sin

in a common business place, should find no sanction in the

house where God is worshiped."—Id., volume 5, pages 491, 492. 3. "When the minister enters, it should be with dignified, SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY 15

5. "Go early to church. Not only be punctual, but be in your place before the hour announced for the service to begin. "Go in a reverent spirit. On the way, remember whither you go. Avoid lightness of manner, and conversation on worldly topics. "Before you enter and as you enter the church, breathe a silent prayer of invocation for the influence of the Holy Spirit. "As you take your place, bow your head reverently in prayer for yourself and for all others who enter the sanctuary. "Resolve that you will foster no thought, fix your eyes on no object, utter no word, that will tend to divert your mind from the holy purpose for which you have come into this place. "As the minister enters the pulpit, offer an earnest silent prayer in his behalf. "In all the service, take an active part, as hearer, as wor-shiper. "At the close of the service, after a moment of prayerful silence, greet with quiet cheerfulness and good will all whom you happen to meet, remembering that Christian fellowship is a part of Christian worship."—Bishop Vincent.
