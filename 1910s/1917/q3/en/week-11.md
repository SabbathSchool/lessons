1. "I will make an help meet for him"-not a helpmeet nor

a helpmate, but a help meet (two words) for him; that is, fit

or suitable for him. '

"Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him, as the head, nor

to be trampled under his feet, as an inferior, but to stand by

his side, as an, equal, to be loved and protected by him. A

part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was

his second self; showing the close union and the affectionate

attachment that should exist in this relation."-"Patriarchs

and Prophets." page 46. 32 SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

4. No position in life is superior to that of the mother, no influence more potent for good or evil. "All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my... mother," said Abraham Lincoln. "All that I have ever accomplished in life, I owe to my mother," de-clared D. L. Moody. "A kiss from my mother," said Benjamin West, "made me a painter." "My mother was the making of me," declares the noted inventor, Thomas A. Edison. An-drew Carnegie, the millionaire, who gave his mother his earn-ings when a boy, adds, "I am deeply touched by the remem-brance of one to whom I owe everything that a wise mother ever gave to a son who adored her." It has been truly said that "the home is the primeval school, the best, the most hal-lowed, and the most potential of all academies, and that the mother is the first, the most influential, and therefore the most important of all teachers."
