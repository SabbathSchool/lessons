## Notes

1. "Those who empty their hearts of vanity and rubbish, through the giace of God may purify the mind, and make it a storehouse of knowledge, purity, and truth. And it will be continually' reaching beyond the narrow boundaries of worldly thought, into the vastness of the infinite."-"Counsels to Teachers," page

2. "The young man who makes the Bible his guide, need not mistake the path of duty and of safety. That book will teach him to preserve his integrity of character, to be truth-ful, to practice no deception. It will teach him that he must never transgress God's law in order to accomplish a desired object, even though to obey involves a sacrifice."-Id., page

4. David thought and purposed in his heart to build a house for God, though he was not permitted to accomplish the work. God was so pleased with David's purpose to do that good work, that He promised to establish David's house for time and eternity. God is no respecter of persons. He is looking to-day for hearts that are prompted, as was David, to do something for Him-; and every such one becomes con-nected with the "sure mercies of David."

271. , Q. "God will accept the youth with their talent and their wealth of affection, if they will consecrate themselves to Him. They may reach to the highest point of intellectual greatness; and if balanced by religious principle, they can carry forward the work which Christ came from heaven to accomplish."— "Counsels to Teachers," page
