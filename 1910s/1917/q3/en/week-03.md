## Notes

2. From the days of Moses, God had been known as the rock of refuge and the rock of salvation. God manifested in the flesh was the rock foundation for the church. The union of the divine and the human in Christ was to be brought out in the church; and through this union, the church was to tri-umph over all foes.
