## Notes

2. God might have remained alone with His Son. But, in-stead, He purposed to create other beings to enjoy His love and revealed goodness. So He chose to create other intelli-gences upon whom or to whom He could exhibit His attri-butes of holiness, justice, wisdom, goodness, and mercy. These qualities of His character must have remained forever hidden and dormant in the bosom of the eternal Father, if there had not been beings created upon whom He could pour out that wealth of divine love and mercy which was treasured in His heart from the days of eternity. Hence seraphs, angels, and men.

3. Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in the divine government, that gave occasion for the uprising of rebellion. Read "Great Controversy," chapter
