## Notes

1. The city of Athens was famed for its architecture and art, and for the education and intelligence of its people. But it was nevertheless shrouded in heathenism. Statues of gods and deified heroes were to be seen in every direction. Temples and sanctuaries with their altars and filled with idols were on every hand. There were the sculptured forms of Minerva, Jupiter, Apollo, and a sanctuary to Bacchus. There were statues of the great men of Athens, such as Solon and Demos-thenes. There were deified heroes of mythology. "Thus, every god in Olympus found a place in the Agora. But the religiousness of the Athenians went even further. For every public place and building was likewise a sanctuary. The Record House was a temple of the mother of the gods. The Council House held statues of Apollo and Jupiter, with an altar of Vesta. The theater at the base of the Acropolis, into which the Athenians crowded to hear the words of their great tragedians, was consecrated to Bacchus." But with all this "vast composition of architecture and sculpture, dedicatedâ€¢ to the national glory and to the worship of the gods," the true God was to them unknown. What a com-mentary on the worthlessness of an education outside of Christ!

3. Areopagus was "a rocky eminence at Athens, near the Acropolis, upon which a sovereign criminal court held its sittings. The judges were called Areopagites, and through a long period were greatly respected." ("Twentieth Cen-tury Dictionary.")

4. The word "superstitious" in this text seems an unfor-tunate translation. The Revised Version gives "religious." Conybeare and Howson translates the text, "I bear witness to your carefulness in religion," and in a footnote adds, "The mistranslation of this verse in the Authorized Version is much to be regretted, because it entirely destroys the graceful courtesy of Paul's opening address, and represents him as beginning his speech by offending his audience."

7. No one under sixty years of age could be a member of the court of the Areopagites. "The court had jurisdiction in criminal and political cases, as well as those affecting public morals." (See Nelson's "Teachers' Testament," note.)
