## Notes

2. Tyrannus was a "sophist or rhetorician of Ephesus, who kept one of those schools of philosophy and eloquence so common at that period." ("Popular and Critical Encyclo-pedia.") "This school `was probably a lecture room, which, as the private property of the owner, was lent or let to the apostles.' Ramsay suggests that it was the lecture room used by the professors of rhetoric and philosophy a part of the day; and Paul at other hours."—"Peloubet's Notes,"

3. "These manifestations of supernatural power were far more potent than had ever before been witnessed in Ephesus, and were of such a character that they could not be imitated by the skill of the juggler or the enchantments of the sorcerer. As these miracles were wrought in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, the people had opportunity to see that the God of heaven was more powerful than the magicians who were wor-shipers of the goddess Diana. Thus the Lord exalted His servant, even before the idolaters themselves, immeasurably above the most powerful and favored of the magicians."— "The Acts of the Apostles," page

4. Exorcism was a belief in demoniacal possessions. In some instances the gift was regarded as divine. "The epithet applied to these exorcists indicates that they were traveling mountebanks, who, beside skill in medicine, pretended to the knowledge of magic." ("Popular and Critical Encyclopedia.")

5. "And the man in whom the_ evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded." "Thus unmistakable proof was given of the sacredness of the name of Christ, and the peril which they incurred who should invoke it without faith in the divinity of the Saviour's mission. 'Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page
