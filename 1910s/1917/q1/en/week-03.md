## Notes

1. "This woman was a special agent of Satan, and had brought to her masters much gain by soothsaying. Her in-fluence had helped to strengthen idolatry. Satan knew that his kingdom was being invaded, and he resorted to this means of opposing the work of God, hoping to mingle his sophistry with the truths taught by those who were proclaiming the gospel message."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

19. This same power should attend the gospel now.

3. "The jailer fulfilled the directions of the magistrates with rigorous and conscientious cruelty. Not content with placing the apostles among such other offenders against the law as were in custody at Philippi, he 'thrust them into the inner prison,' and then forced their limbs, lacerated as they were, and beeding from the rod, into a painful and con-strained posture, by means of an instrument employed to confine and torture the bodies of the worst malefactors."-- "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page

6. In these damp, dark, pestilential cells the chains are said to have rusted on the limbs of the prisoners. The legs, arms, and neck of offenders were confined and stretched in the stocks, produc-ing excruciating torture. In such a place, their bodies lacer-ated and bleeding, the apostles were heard singing a duet of praise and thanksgiving to God. No murmuring or com-plaining. What a beautiful' esson of trust in God is here presented!

7. The law of Rome made it a crime to scourge a Roman citizen or deprive him of liberty without a fair trial. The apostles, knowing this, stood upon their rights as citizens.

8. "In Paul's time, Roman citizenship conferred freedom from, corporal punishment, the right of appeal to the em-peror against the sentences of magistrates, the right to hold office, and exemption from direct taxation."—"Te'achers' Testament," Nelson, note.
