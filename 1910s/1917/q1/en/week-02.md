## Notes

37. "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page

4. Gospel workers may learn a lesson from the watchful-ness of the apostle Paul over those whom he had brought to Christ through his ministry. Having seen the baneful fruit of apostasy, and the distracting influence of false teachers, who, not by open antagonism, but rather by clan-destine intrigue, came spying around the church to pull down what he by hard labor had built up, he bent all his energies to save the flock from being deceived. He warned "every one night and day with tears" in order that he might "present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."

5. "How could Paul consent to take with him a companion who would really prove an embarrassment and a hindrance? Such a task as that of spreading the gospel of God in a hostile world needs a resolute will and an undaunted courage. And the work is too sacred to be put in jeopardy by any experiments. Mark had been tried once and found wanting.... And Barnabas would not be without strong arguments to defend the justice of his claims. It was hard to expect him to resign his interest in one who had cost him much anxiety and many prayers. His dearest wish was to see his young kinsman approving himself as a missionary of Christ."— Id., page
