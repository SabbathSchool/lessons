## Notes

1. This council was held at a time between the first and second missionary tours of the apostle Paul in Asia Minor. While there is a difference of opinion as to the year, it prob-ably was about A. D.

3. "The Pharisees had been the companions of St. Paul's younger days. Death had made many changes in the course of fifteen years; but some must have been there who had studied with him 'at the feet of Gamaliel.' Their opposition was doubtless embittered by remembering what he had been before his conversion."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, People's Edition, page

4. "Far more was involved than any mere opposition, how-ever factious, to individual missionaries, or than the severity of any conditions imposed on individual converts. The ques-tion of liberty or bondage for all future ages was to be de-cided; and a convention of the whole church at Jerusalem was evidently called for."— Id., page

5. "Peter related the plain interpretation of these words, which was given him almost immediately in his summons to go to the centurion and instruct him in the faith of Christ. This message showed that God was no respecter of persons, but accepted and acknowledged all who feared Him. Peter told of his astonishment when, in speaking the words of truth to those assembled at the home of Cornelius, he witnessed the Holy Spirit taking possession of his hearers, gentiles as well as Jews."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

6. "This yoke was not the law of Ten Commandments, as some who oppose the binding claims of the law assert; Peter here referred to the law of ceremonies, which was made null and void by the crucifixion of Christ."— Id., page
