2. Diana was "the Roman goddess of the moon, and of field and woods, and of all forms of life and activity which were supposed to be influenced by the moon. Her image was supposed to have fallen from heaven." (Id.) Her worship was nature worship with all its abominations.

4. The Revised Version reads, "And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends." These were the officers having charge of the Roman province of Asia; and their course indi-cates that the better class of people had no sympathy with the mob, and were really Paul's friends.

6. "Coins show that in the several cities of Asia Minor the town clerk presided in popular assemblies, and was the vir-tual, or in some cases the actual, head of the municipal gov-ernment."—"A Dictionary of the Bible," Davis.
