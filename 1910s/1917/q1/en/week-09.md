## Notes

1. "From Ephesus Paul set forth on another missionary tour, during which he hoped to visit once more the scenes of his former labors in Europe. Tarrying for a time at Troas, `to preach Christ's gospel,' he found some who were ready to listen to his message. 'A door was opened unto me of the Lord,' he afterward declared of his labors in this place. But successful as were his efforts at Troas, he could not remain there long. 'The care of all the churches,' and particularly of the church at Corinth, rested heavily on his heart. He had hoped to meet Titus at Troas, and to learn from him how the words of counsel and reproof sent to the Corinthian brethren had been received; but in this he was disappointed." —"The Acts of the Apostles," page

478. "From Macedonia, perhaps from Philippi, he wrote the second epistle to the Corinthians, which he soon followed in person. From Corinth he wrote his epistle to the Romans, in order to prepare the brethren of Rome for his personal preaching. Phoebe, the deaconess, was probably the bearer of the letter. But before going to Rome he visits Jerusa-lem."—"Concise Cyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," page

5. "And strength and peace were surely sought and ob-tained by the apostle from the Redeemer, as he pursued his lonely road that Sunday afternoon in spring, among the oak woods and streams of Ida."— Id., page
