## Notes

6. Timotheus howelier seems to have rejoined Paul and Silas either at Thessalonica or Berea.

2. While it might be inferred from Paul's statement that he preached "three Sabbath days," that his stay was limited to this time, many Bible writers think that he remained a longer time.

3. Paul, as a great gospel preacher, did not dwell upon the social and ethical questions of his time, but proclaimed with power the vital truth of Christianity from the Scriptures. He preached in verity the word of God.

4. "The length of St. Paul's stay in the city is quite un-certain. From the fact that the Bereans were occupied 'daily' in searching the Scriptures for arguments to establish or confute the apostle's doctrine, we conclude that he remained there several days at least. From his own assertion in his first letter to the Thessalonians, that, at the time when he had been recently taken away from them, he was very anx-ious, and used every effort to revisit them, we cannot doubt that he lingered as long as possible in the neighborhood of Thessalonica."â€”"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page

5. Thessalonica was a seaport of great commercial impor-tance at that time. As news from there would be carried throughout a wide, area, it is quite probable that the disorderly demonstrations, as well as the miraculous demonstration in the deliverance of Paul and Silas, were very widely known.
