## Notes

1. Ephesus was about thirty-six miles north from Miletus. One can well imagine the joy of the elders on receiving a summons to meet the one to whose instruction, they had lis-tened in the school of Tyrannus.

2. Paul's work was not alone in speaking to the public con-gregation, but he combined personal work from house to house. We will do well to emphasize the methods of this great mis-sionary, and practice them in our lives.

3. Conybeare and Howson render this verse, "Testifying both to Jews and gentiles their need of repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ." This would make his work very personal in its application.

4. Conybeare and Howson translate this text, "And now, as for me, behold, I go to Jerusalem, in spirit foredoomed to chains." The aged hero of the cross seemed to see the clouds darkening, and great trials awaiting him. These things, with the burden of all the churches, weighed greatly on his heart.

13. It was not best for the churches to be free of all financial burden in this matter, neither could it have been for the apostle, who must to some extent have been hindered in the work of preaching, while earning a living.
