2. The time the ship remained at Tyre was doubtless con-sumed in taking out and receiving cargo, and perhaps wait-ing for favorable breezes. Paul improved the opportunity in strengthening and encouraging the believers. A church is said to have been established here at the dispersion conse-quent upon the death of Stephen. Some of the believers seem to have been endued with the gift of prophecy.

3. The last parting moments here, as at Miletus, were em-ployed in praying to Him who alone can give true comfort and protection. This contains a lesson we all will do well to heed.

31. It was one of the towns of the tribes of Asher. While Tyre, the seaport which formed the "burden of the sublimest prophecies in the last days of the Hebrew monarchy," and Cwsarea, founded by the family of Herod, have both fallen into decay, Ptolemais, older than either; has outlived them both.

5. This is the same Philip who preached the gospel to the Samaritans and baptized the Ethiopian eunuch.

8. Though Paul's heart was moved and almost broken by the tears, sorrow, and entreaties of his companions and friends at the prospect of imprisonment and danger before him, he was unwavering in his purpose, seeing victory through all the hindrances which were before him.

10. This was Paul's last visit to Jerusalem. Doubtless many things here stirred his memory. He moved among com-paratively few friends, and many enemies.
