1. The modern name is Malta, now a British naval station. It is sixty miles from the island of Sicily, and two hundred from the African coast. A bay on the north side of the island has been named St. Paul's Bay, where it is supposed the party landed.

2. To the Greeks, all were "barbarians" who did not speak Greek. The people were of Phoenician origin. It was prob-ably late in October, and already the chill nights and mornings of autumn had begun. The kindness shown by the islanders was repaid in blessings later.

3. Worn with watchings and exertion, the aged apostle was nevertheless not one to sit quietly while work was to be done. He was "instant in season" not only in preaching the Word, but in doing any other task.

5. November, December, and January had been spent in Malta, evidently; and with early February, the Alexandrian grain ships were again moving toward Italy. Syracuse was the great port of Sicily; and at Rhegium, at the toe of the Italian boot, the apostle first touched Italy. The company landed at Puteoli, on the present Bay of Naples.
