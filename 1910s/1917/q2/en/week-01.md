## Notes

2. "The gathering of these contributions had cost the apostle and his fellow workers much time, anxious thought, and wearisome labor. The sum, which far exceeded the ex-pectations of the elders at Jerusalem, represented many sac-rifices and even severe privations on the part of the gentile believers. These freewill offerings betokened the loyalty of the gentile converts to the organized work of God throughout the world."—`The Acts of the Apostles," page

9. In these years, the mes-sage had been carried by Paul and his associates into Europe, as well as among Greeks and others in Asia Minor. It must have been a stirring missionary report that Paul gave.

5. "The brethren hoped that Paul, by following the course suggested, might give a decisive contradiction to the false reports concerning him.... The Spirit of God did not prompt this instruction; it was the fruit of cowardice."—Id., page

6. "When we think of Paul's great desire to be in harmony with his brethren, his tenderness toward the weak in the faith, his reverence for the apostles who had been with Christ, and for James, the brother of the Lord, and his purpose to become all things to all men so far as he could without sac-rificing principle,—when we think of all this, it is less sur-prising that he was constrained to deviate from the firm, decided course that he had hitherto followed."—Id., page

8. The large gift that Paul and his associates brought from the churches in Europe was an evidence of the unity of "the organized work of God throughout the world." See Note

14. Just so our Sabbath schools and churches to-day, in all the world, unite in forward "the organized work of God throughout the world" by gifts for missions and by prayer for the fields. It is the spirit of the gospel.

22. But here he went too far. "He was not authorized of God to concede as much as they asked.... Instead of accomplishing the desired object, his efforts for conciliation only precipitated the crisis."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page

405. But it was an error of judgment in the longing to help; and the Lord never forsakes the soul who is trying to take the right course in a delicate situation. The Christian is to stand for conciliation without compromise of principle, and for loyalty to principle without uncharitable-ness or fleshly stubbornness.
