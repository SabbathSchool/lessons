## Notes

1. Tertullus. "The name is Roman, and there is little doubt that he was an Italian, and spoke on this occasion in Latin."â€” Conybeare and Howson.

3. The climax of the accusation was the charge of profana-tion of the temple. The Romans allowed the Jews to put any Dne to death who was found polluting their temple. With this, it was charged that Paul was a stirrer up of sedition, the Jews knowing well that the Roman authorities were likely to lay hands on any one raising sedition, with which they had had so much trouble.

4. Paul showed tliat he had not been long enough in Jeru-salem to be the leader of a seditious party. He challenged proof of the things charged. The Jews themselves were seditious, and plotters against the superior civil authority, which later they tried to overturn altogether. As a Chris-tian, the apostle Paul was subject to the powers of govern-ment in all things civil.

5. Temperance means self-control, chastity. Felix was liv-ing a vicious life, and the terrors of the coming Judgment made him tremble.

6. The inspired record leaves Felix in his baseness, doing injustice to Paul to please the Jews. There had been an out-break between the Jews and the gentiles in Caesarea; and on accusation of the Jews, Felix had been called to account by Nero, at Rome. He was pardoned, however, but apparently never achieved distinction again, and he had turned from life eternal. It is evident, from history, that Drusilla and her son by Felix perished in the great eruption of Vesuvius, in A. D.
