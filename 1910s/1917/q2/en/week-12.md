## Notes

1. If Paul had been teaching that the seventh day was no longer the Sabbath, he could not have said this to the Jews. How quickly such teaching would have brought the apostle into controversy!

2. Paul's appeal to Cmsar was not to accuse any, or to plead for the punishment of persecutors. He had simply used his rights as a Roman citizen to prolong his opportunity to bear witness to Christ, and to prevent his being thrown into the hands of ecclesiastics who would quickly have si-lenced his testimony.
