## Notes

1. Not as a guilty criminal cringing before the judge, but as a witness and pleader for a great cause, the apostle stood before the assembly. His hand, though possibly the one from which a chain was hanging, was stretched forth in gesture to command attention, after the manner of the practiced orator.

2. Agrippa and Bernice were wicked and corrupt, despicable in character. But the apostle respected the position of author-ity the king held; and, moreover, it was his opportunity to bear witness before a king who needed help, and before the great of earth who had seldom heard the gospel. His manner was respectful and courteous; and throughout his address, we hear him appealing to this wicked king and his wicked sister to turn to God.

4. "With you" is in the plural, taking in the whole assembly. The fulfillment of the hope of Israel was dependent upon the resurrection. Abraham and all the faithful were dead, yet God had promised an everlasting inheritance to them.

5. The Presbyterian commentator, Dr. Albert Barnes, says, "None but a madman will persecute men on account of their religious opinions."
