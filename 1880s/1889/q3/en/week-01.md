## NOTES

It is stated in answer to question 8 that man lost by the fall holiness, dominion, and life. This will be evident to all who will briefly consider the matter. 1. God created man upright and pronounced him good. Eccl. 7:29; Gen. 1:31. Man was therefore holy, not righteous; for righteousness implies a character formed in harmony with a rule of right, but holy in the sense that he belonged to God, and was wholly free from sin. He transgressed the command of God and became a sinner, or lost his holiness. 2. God gave him dominion over the earth. Gen. 1:28; Ps. 115:16. But when man transgressed he became a child of Satan, a slave of sin (Rom. 7:14); and therefore his dominion passed to Satan, to whom he had yielded. 3. If man had continued to obey God, he would never have died. Righteousness tendeth to life (Prov. 10:16, 17; 11:30); but man sinned, and the wages of sin is death. Rom. 6:23. Therefore man lost by the fall holiness, dominion, and life.

"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked." Job. 9:24. The wicked of course includes wicked men, but it does not refer to them primarily. Satan is the root of wickedness—wicked men are the branches. Said Jesus to the Jews, "Ye are of your father the devil." John 8:44. That is, as regards character, wicked men are the offspring of Satan. When man was created, God gave him dominion over the earth (Gen. 1:26); but when man turned from God and yielded to Satan, he became subject to Satan, and the world passed under Satan's control. Hence Satan is called in the Scriptures, "the prince of this world" (John 12:31), and "the god of this world" (2 Cor. 4:4); or, according to another Scripture, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil [wicked] one." John 5:19, Revised Version. Therefore when Job says, "The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covereth the faces of the judges thereof," it means that Satan and his servants so rule that the faces of the righteous judges are covered for shame and grief. See 2 Sam. 19:4, and Jer. 14:4.
