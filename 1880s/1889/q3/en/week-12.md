## NOTES

In a certain sense, everything we have and are belongs to God; but there are some things that belong to him in a special sense. Those things which he has never given to man for his own use are God's and his alone. The Sabbath, the tithe, and the first-fruits in the former dispensation, illustrate this fact. God has also permitted men to make gifts to him, and to consecrate a portion of their substance, their talents, or their time, especially to his service. This the Lord also accepts, and it becomes consecrated and holy. In the former dispensation after men had consecrated a portion of their substance, if in any way they wished to change it the Lord would have them add one-fifth to it that they might realize the sacredness of his claims. When men realize and acknowledge the importance of God's claims, he has promised to let a special blessing rest upon them. The paying of the tithe also secured the heart from covetousness; for continual giving serves to cultivate the spirit of benevolence, which is a part of the grace of Christ.

The Levitical priesthood received the tithe from the people, and they gave a tithe of what they received to the ones who had special charge of the work of God. Another tithe was taken for the poor. Thus there were two tithes, one going to the priests and the other going to the poor. The apostle, in 1 Cor. 9, teaches the duty of those who have received the gospel to support the same. He appeals to the law, and then applies it to the gospel. Men cannot give the tithe as a donation, because it never was theirs; but God has permitted them to handle the tithe, and then return it to God, that it may cultivate in them that spirit of liberality which was manifest in Christ's coming to this earth to die. The tithing system, therefore, is one of the greatest blessings to man.
