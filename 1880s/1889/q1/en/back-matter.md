## FATHERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know how to avoid error in the future, must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new phase of paganism. It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book. Fine English cloth, substantially bound, contains about 400 pages, and will be sent post-paid at the nominal price of $1.00. Address all orders to the

## THE SABBATH AND THE LORD'S DAY

The $500 and $1,000 Prize Essays

THE above is the title of a pamphlet recently issued. In its pages, the author reviews the two most recent, and without doubt the best, contributions to the defense of Sunday, popularly called the "Lord's Day." The first of these essays was written by Rev. George Elliott, and took the $500 "Fletcher Prize," offered by the trustees of Dartmouth College for the best essay on the "Perpetual Obligation of the Lord's Day."

The other Essay was written by A. E. Waffle, M. A., and was awarded a $1,000 prize by the Committee of Publication of the American Sunday-School Union.

We state thus definitely the source of the Essays reviewed that all may see their importance. Certainly if there was any argument in favor of Sunday, we should expect to find it in these prize essays. Elder Jones in his Review takes up their arguments and assertions, and shows very plainly that several times the authors have proved what they did not want to prove at all—namely: That the Seventh-day Sabbath is still as binding on all as when the law was given.

This Review will be read with interest and profit by all, and those who have friends that are interested in the Sabbath Question should see that one of these pamphlets is placed in their hands.
