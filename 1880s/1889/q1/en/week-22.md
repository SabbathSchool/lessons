### NOTE

SUCH presumptuous rebellion as was manifested by the people on this occasion, can be accounted for only by saying that it was caused by the blindness of unbelief. Their hearts had been hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, until they were ready to charge God to his face with injustice. Such Heaven-daring rebellion seems almost incredible, yet it is often equaled in our day. The Israelites had the same human nature that men have nowadays, and were not sinners above all that have ever lived.
