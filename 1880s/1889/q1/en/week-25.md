Ans.—That while those who die as a punishment for their sins, get only what they lawfully deserve, eternal life cannot be earned, but is something infinitely beyond the power of any human being to earn. God does not pay us for what we do, for we cannot do anything that is worth paying for; at the best we are but unprofitable servants. But he gives us all that we have, and all that we can ever receive, because of his own wondrous love and mercy, and the merit of Jesus Christ in whom we live.
