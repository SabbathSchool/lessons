### SUGGESTIONS FOR QUARTERLY REVIEW

[NOTE.—It is not expected that the teachers will use just these questions in their review. They are only suggestive, and do not cover nearly all the ground. Some lessons are not even referred to. It would be an impossibility for any teacher to cover in one lesson all the principal points that have been passed over during the quarter, and therefore each teacher should carefully review all the preceding lessons, and select just those points which impress him as being the most important, or containing thoughts most necessary for that special time, and confine his attention to them. Points that received insufficient attention in the first instance, may now be dwelt upon at greater length.

We would advise that the superintendent or division leader do not go over the same ground that the most of the teachers do, but take up some other portion of the review, as by so doing much more ground can be covered.]

1. BY what means was the sanctuary built?
2. Tell how it was repaired.
3. What was the result when the people gave willingly?
4. What enabled them to give so willingly?
5. In order to have our gifts of money acceptable to God, what must we first do? 2 Cor. 8:5.
6. What is the only kind of giving that God loves or will accept?
7. What was the tabernacle for?
8. In what part was God's presence specially manifested?
9. What was represented by the ark, with the cherubim of glory overshadowing it?
10. What was signified by the fact that underneath the cherubim of glory was the law of God?
11. What is sin?
12. What is indicated by the fact that immediately above the law which had been transgressed, was the mercy-seat, and the cherubim between which the glory of God appeared? Ans.—That God sits upon a throne of grace, and delights in mercy, and that wherever there is sin there is the remedy. "Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other." Where sin abounds, grace does much more abound. Whenever a sin is committed, the remedy is immediately at hand.
13. By what various judgments did God show that it is not a light thing to speak against his servants?
14. On what various instances did the Israelites show their wicked unbelief of God?
15. What is the foundation of all goodness? 2 Peter 1:5; Jude 20, 21.
16. Then what must be the universal besetting sin?
17. To what then must we take heed? Heb. 3:12, 13; 4:1, 2.
18. What evidence have we that God will not make the slightest excuse for sin, even in his most highly honored and best-beloved servant?
19. By what were the people in those days saved, when they sinned?
