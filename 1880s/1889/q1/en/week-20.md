### NOTE

THE reason why the Lord will guide the meek rather than any others, is because they are the only ones that he can guide. The proud trust to their own judgment, and will not follow the leadings of God's Spirit. And since "it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps," it follows that "pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall." But those who "have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3), are in a condition to accept the wisdom that comes from above. God desires to guide all men in judgment, and lead them in the right way; but since he will not force any to go contrary to their wishes, the meek, who distrust themselves, are the only ones whom he can guide. How much better for a man not to lean to his own understanding, when he can have the benefit of God's wisdom. Happy is the man who can say from the heart,

"I'd rather walk in the dark with God,
Than walk alone in the light."
