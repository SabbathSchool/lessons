### NOTE

THE rendering in our common version, which makes the quail to have been piled up "two cubits high upon the face of the earth," is uncalled for and unwarranted. The Revised Version gives the proper sense and rendering, by putting it, "about two cubits above the face of the earth." The Vulgate has it, "And they flew in the air, about two cubits above the earth." This is a very free translation, nevertheless it exactly expresses the sense of the original. The quails flew about breast high, and so were easily killed. Many readers of this will recall flights of pigeons in such numbers as to darken the sun, and when they flew so low as to be easily knocked down with clubs. In the case under consideration, the quails were brought miraculously, and were doubtless in miraculous numbers; but the Bible, rightly translated, gives no countenance to the absurdity of either living or dead birds being piled up three feet high for a space two days' journey in diameter.
