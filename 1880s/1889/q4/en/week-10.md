### Notes

Heb. 6:14 is an intensive form of expression not uncommon in the Hebrew. It denotes certainty. Two instances are found in Genesis 2. Verse 16 reads: "Of every tree of the garden eating thou shalt eat." It is translated, "Thou mayest freely eat." Verse 17 reads: "In the day that thou eatest thereof dying thou shalt die." Rendered, "Thou shalt surely die." These translations are literally correct, the words freely and surely representing the certainty contained in the form of the original. Again in Ex. 3:7 the Lord said, "Seeing I have seen the affliction of my people." Stephen, quoting this (Acts 7:34), expressed the intensive of the original by a repetition: "I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people." And indeed duplication is another method of expressing intensiveness in the Hebrew, as "good good," for very good. Our version very correctly translates Ex. 3:7, "I have surely seen."

As faith rests only on the word of God (Rom. 10:17), so hope rests only on the promise of God. Where God has not spoken there can be no faith. There may be opinion, or conjecture, or strong feeling, and even much confidence, but no faith. So where there is no promise of God there may be feeling, and strong self-confidence, but no true hope. And a promise fulfilled is no longer a promise—it is a matter of the past. Hope can no longer rest upon it, "for hope that is seen is not hope." Once received, it is no longer hoped for. Losing sight of this evident truth many have been led to indulge false hopes. They will profess to hope in God, while there is not a promise within their reach. For all the promises of God rest on conditions, and if we neglect the conditions, we cannot rightfully claim the promises. Claiming God's promises without fulfilling their conditions is not an indication of faith but of presumption. But if indeed we have fled for refuge to Christ, and have laid hold upon the hope set before us, what a strong consolation we have in the sure promise of God confirmed by his oath, brought near by the blood and intercession of our high priest in the heavens!
