### Note

Moses was a servant, as a testimony of those things to be spoken after. That is, Moses, in his official capacity, was a type of Christ. See Deut. 18:15. And, of course, his house, the house of Israel, bore the same relation to the household of faith that he bore to Christ. This is the second point in the apostle's argument on the Hebrew Scriptures concerning the dignity of Christ. First, he proves by the prophets that the Messiah is above the angels; that they are commanded to worship him; he is the Son of God, by whom all things were made. Secondly, being a Son, he is superior to Moses, who was but a servant. As the one by whom the worlds were made, he must have more honor than the creatures he has made. It will be seen, as we proceed, that the writer constructs his argument on the main points of the Scriptures which they knew and believed, so as to settle and establish them in the faith of the gospel; for it was to Hebrew converts to Christianity, to the brethren, that he was writing.
