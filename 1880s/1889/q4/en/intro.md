# Letter to the Hebrews

*For Senior Classes.*

Oct. 5 to Dec. 28, 1889.

## Introductory Noticeâ€”To Teachers

There is one thing I would like to impress upon the mind of every teacher; that is, the importance of knowing that his pupils understand the words of the lesson. The letter to the Hebrews is among the things of which Peter wrote (2 Peter 3:16), and not a little study is required to obtain clear ideas of these things.

I have had considerable opportunity to observe that pupils often go groping through their lessons for want of a proper understanding of the terms used. In the letter to the Hebrews are found many words not often heard by young people, the meaning of which may not be perfectly clear to them. In studying such a book as this, the teacher could not engage in a more profitable exercise than to spend a minute or two in questioning the class on the meaning of the words, before he engages in the regular class work. In most cases he will not only find that he has not lost time by so doing, but he will soon perceive that his work has been more satisfactory, the truths of the lessons being more deeply impressed on the minds of the scholars.
