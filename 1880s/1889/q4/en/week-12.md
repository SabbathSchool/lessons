### Note

We are led, by all the Scriptures, to believe that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham only in respect to his position or office as priest-king. Abraham was not a king; he was only a stranger and pilgrim in the land. The priesthood of Melchizedek and of Aaron were both typical of that of Christ; but as a type the former stood highest, because Aaron had no kingship connected with his priesthood. It is this fact that gives the priesthood of Melchizedek superiority over that of Aaron. Inasmuch as Aaron had no kingship, were it not for Melchizedek we should have but a limited and very imperfect type of the priesthood of Christ. In other respects, Abraham doubtless was not inferior to Melchizedek.
