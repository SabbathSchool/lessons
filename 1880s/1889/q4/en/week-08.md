### Notes

The apostle has now reached the fourth and final main point in his argument. After the heavenly beings, the angels, the Hebrews revered the name of Moses, their leader from the land of Egypt, through whom they received their rites, their ecclesiastical and civil laws; and Joshua, the successor of Moses, who led them into the promised land, and who so victoriously conquered their enemies; and Aaron, who was consecrated a priest to make atonement for them, and whose sons alone held that office. In this letter One is introduced of whom the Scriptures speak as receiving the worship of angels, who made all things, and who bears the name of God. He is above Moses, who was but a servant, and a witness of the things relating to Christ; above Joshua, who gave them but a temporary rest, the true rest remaining to be given by the Messiah; he is above Aaron; he is a priest after the order of Melchizedek. The difference of the two orders occupies specially the attention of the writer. The priesthood whereby comes the atonement being the central point of their whole system, is the main point of consideration in this letter.

"Thou art a priest forever." So it was said to Aaron and his sons: "Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." Ex. 40:15; Num. 25:13. This signified that the priesthood should be theirs as long as it endured. So also of Christ; he should be priest continually and without interruption or succession. For this is often the meaning of everlasting and forever. See Ex. 21:6. The servant was to serve his master forever, which meant as long as he lived. The priesthood of Christ will remain with him only, but it will also end. His priestly robes will be changed for "the garments of vengeance." Isa. 59:17. Then he will come to take vengeance on his foes. 2 Thess. 1:6-8. The day of salvation, during which he pleads for man, will be succeeded by the great day of the wrath of the Lamb. Rev. 6:16, 17.
