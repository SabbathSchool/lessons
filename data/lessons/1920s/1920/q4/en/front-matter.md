## The Fundamentals of Geology

THE reliability of the Bible account of creation is questioned by many because of its lack of harmony with the popular so-called "scientific" geological and evolutionary theories generally taught. In a clear and interesting way, Prof. George McCready Price shows, in his book "Fundamentals of Geology," that modern geological discoveries are entirely out of joint with the standard geological theories. This comparison of theory with fact is truly a revelation, and his work is heartily endorsed by leading educators. For example, Prof. George Howard Parker, of the Harvard University, writes, "I think you have brought out with great clearness the difficulties of supporting the evolution theory from the geological side." And Prof. William G. Moorehead, of the Xenia Theological Seminary, Xenia, Ohio, says: "I must confess that I have never read anything clearer and more convincing on the subject. It seems to me final, so far as the evolutionary theories and claims go."

Inasmuch as this subject of geology, rocks, strata, and formations, and the general theory of evolution, is constantly met by the advocate of the inspiration of the Bible, this book will be a very valuable reference with this quarter's lessons. It lifts the doctrine of a universal Deluge out of the obscurity into which it has fallen for nearly a century, and gives it once more a respectable standing as the most reasonable hypothesis by which to explain the facts of geology as we now know them.
