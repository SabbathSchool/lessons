## Notes

1. "The revelation of Himself that God has given in His Word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding the nature of God, but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not been given us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God. None are to indulge in speculation regarding His nature. Here silence is eloquence. The Omniscient One is above discussion."—"Ministry of Healing," page 429.

2. The doctrine that matter always existed has been taught by practically all systems of philosophy from the time of the early Greeks; but it is an essentially heathen doctrine, attempting to account for the things we see without recognizing God as their Creator. "In the creation of the earth, God was not indebted to preexisting matter. 'He spake, and it was; . . . He commanded, and it stood fast.' All things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice, and were created for His own purpose. The heavens and all the host of them, the earth and all things therein, came into existence by the breath of His mouth."—Id., pages 414, 415.

3. From these scriptures, it is plain that the means of creation was God's spoken word. He was in no sense dependent upon substances found ready to hand. Even the first plants did not grow as they did later and do now; for in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven, "no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up." Gen. 2:5, A.R.V.

4. How great is the reason for praise when all God's creatures recognize their dependence upon Him for their very existence, for the substance itself of which they consist!

5. The "heaven" here spoken of is evidently not the third heaven where God dwells. It is the "firmament," or expanse immediately above the earth. This involved the creation of air to lift moisture above the earth, thus starting the process of a mist going up from the earth to water vegetation and make the air humid, as described in Gen. 2:6. The connection shows the sense in which the word "heaven" is used.

6. The most recent discoveries in biology which have bearing upon the problems of heredity, show conclusively that each form of plant and animal life still reproduces only "after its kind." The law of heredity, often called Mendel's law, after its discoverer, shows that certain characteristics of plants and animals, such as color, tallness, and dwarfness, depend upon the presence of corresponding units of height or color in the germ cells. Commenting on this law as applied to peas, George McCready Price, in his "New Light on the Doctrine of Creation," says:

   "If we confine our study to the two contrasted characters, tallness and dwarfness, we see that just three kinds of peas exist; namely, dwarfs which breed true, talls which breed true, and talls which always give the same definite proportion of talls and dwarfs among their descendants. Innumerable experiments which have since been made with other pairs of characters have demonstrated that this same mathematical proportion holds good throughout the whole world of plants and animals; and hence this astonishing result is now called Mendel's law, and is regarded as the most important discovery in biology in several generations."—Page 85.

7. What we have in detailed account in this first chapter of Genesis, is merely the origin of the earth, and of the appearance of the heavens as seen from the earth. This expression, "He made the stars also," affirms that the Creator of our earth was also the Creator of the fixed stars, which the heathen round about the Israelites almost universally worshiped as gods and goddesses. The cloud-enveloped earth did not permit the appearance of the heavenly bodies until the fourth day. Note that the sun, the moon, and the stars were to serve as signs, as well as to mark off seasons, years, and days. See Joel 2:10; Matt. 24:29.

8. Here, as in every phase of creation, God performed the original act of existence, or life, then commanded that development and multiplication should go on by the same power that gave them being, and by fixed law determined by Himself.

9. Man and other living creatures are notable instances, in the record of creation, of God's using material already existing to perform an act of creation. Man was formed out of earth, then made alive through that same living breath which had brought all the rest of creation into existence. He is kept alive by the same means.

10. "Here is clearly set forth the origin of the human race; and the divine record is so plainly stated that there is no occasion for erroneous conclusions. God created man in His own image. Here is no mystery. There is no ground for the supposition that man was evolved, by slow degrees of development, from the lower forms of animal or vegetable life. Such teaching lowers the great work of the Creator to the level of man's narrow, earthly conceptions. Men are so intent upon excluding God from the sovereignty of the universe, that they degrade man, and defraud him of the dignity of his origin. He who set the starry worlds on high, and tinted with delicate skill the flowers of the field, who filled the earth and the heavens with the wonders of His power, when He came to crown His glorious work, to place one in the midst to stand as ruler of the fair earth, did not fail to create a being worthy of the hand that gave him life. The genealogy of our race, as given by inspiration, traces back its origin, not to a line of developing germs, mollusks, and quadrupeds, but to the great Creator. Though formed from the dust, Adam was 'the son of God.' . . .

    "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience to His will.

    "As man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of lofty stature and perfect symmetry. His countenance bore the ruddy tint of health, and glowed with the light of life and joy. Adam's height was much greater than that of men who now inhabit the earth. Eve was somewhat less in stature; yet her form was noble, and full of beauty. The sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed with a covering of light and glory, such as the angels wear. So long as they lived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued to enshroud them."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 44, 45.

Some one said to a faithful member of the Sabbath school, "How do you always happen to have money for your offering?"

"It does not happen; I plan for it," was the reply.
