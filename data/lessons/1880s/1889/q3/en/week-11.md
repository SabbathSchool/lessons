## NOTE

In the fourteenth chapter of Genesis, every principle of the tithing system is given. Abram gave a tithe of all he possessed to Melchizedek, after which the king of Sodom proposed that he should have the persons, and Abram might keep the substance. That which he had taken from the kings was his by right of conquest, therefore it was his privilege to dispose of it as he thought best. He first gave to God his portion, the tithe of all; he then assured the king of Sodom that he would himself not take anything, even to a shoe latchet; but certain individuals who went with him were to receive their portion, and the young men were to have what they had eaten, and their portion.
