## NOTE

The love of Christ flows spontaneously from the heart. It is heavenly in its nature. It labors not for a reward but it always receives a reward. It forgets itself in its labors for others' good. Angels are interested for the development of its principles. They watch its development in individuals who possess it. They know all the circumstances of their daily life. This is illustrated in the case of Cornelius. All this shows the tender care which God has for his people. An important lesson is taught in the case of Simon the leper. He loved Christ, but he never realized how much the Saviour did for him in forgiving his sins. He appreciated his blessing of health to a limited extent, but the forgiveness of sin was of far greater value. Mary realized the blessing of the forgiveness of her sins. She showed the love she had for Christ on all occasions. She was the last at the sepulcher, and the first to greet her Lord when he arose. Simon must have known Mary's character before the Saviour forgave her sins. He had suspicions of her when she came and anointed Christ. He did not appreciate her motive. But her love knew no bounds. This arose from the fact that she realized how great a sinner she had been. But she was now free from the power of Satan.

"The Saviour had observed all that had taken place and knew the motives of all who were there assembled. He read the object of Mary in her costly offering. Though she had been very sinful, her repentance was sincere, and Jesus, while reproving her guilt, had pitied her weakness, and forgiven her. Mary's heart was filled with gratitude at the compassion of Jesus. Seven times she had heard his stern rebuke to the demons which then controlled her heart and mind, and she had listened to his strong cries to his Father in her behalf. She knew how offensive everything impure was to the unsullied mind of Christ, and she overcame her sin in the strength of her Saviour. She was transformed, a partaker of the divine nature. Mary showed how highly she prized the Saviour when she accounted the most precious gift none too costly for him; but Judas valued Jesus at the price for which he sold him. His niggardly soul balanced the life of the Son of God against a paltry sum of money. The same cold, calculating spirit is manifested by many who profess Christ to-day. Their offerings to his cause are grudgingly bestowed, or withheld altogether under various plausible excuses. A pretense of wide philanthropy, unlimited by church or creed, is not unfrequently one of them, and they plead, like Judas, it is better to give to the poor. But the true Christian shows his faith by investing in the cause of truth; he is known by his works, for faith without works is dead. Jesus in mercy had pardoned the sins of Mary, which had been grievous, and her heart was full of love for her Saviour. She had often heard him speak of his approaching death, and she was grieved that he should meet such a cruel fate. At great personal sacrifice she had purchased an alabaster box of precious ointment, with which to anoint the body of the Saviour at his death. But she now heard many express their opinion that he would be elevated to kingly authority when he went to Jerusalem, and she was only too ready to believe that it would be so. She rejoiced that her Saviour would no longer be despised and rejected, and obliged to flee for his life. In her love and gratitude she wished to be the first to give him honor, and, seeking to avoid observation, anointed his head and feet with the precious ointment, then wiped his feet with her flowing hair. Her movements had been unobserved by the others, but the odor filled the house with its fragrance, and published her acts to all who were present. Some of the disciples manifested displeasure at this act, and Judas boldly expressed his disapprobation at such wasteful extravagance. Simon, the host, who was a Pharisee, was influenced by the words of Judas, and his heart filled with unbelief. He also thought that Jesus should hold no communication with Mary because of her past life. Judas, the prime instigator of this disaffection among those who sat at the table, was a stranger to the deep devotion and homage which actuated Mary to her deed of love."

We learn a very important lesson from this: First, we appreciate Christ in proportion as we realize our past sinfulness, and the blessing of pardon which has come to us; second, our offerings to his cause show that appreciation; third, consequently our offerings are a manifestation of the appreciation of the Saviour as a sin-pardoning God to us. In taking this view of the matter we might well inquire, "How much owest thou my Lord?"
