## NOTES

To wait for Christ's second coming is to occupy a position of constant expectation. It could not be said that we were in a waiting position for a train of cars unless we had reached the station, and were ready for the train when it should arrive. Some will be prepared when the Lord comes, and such only can be said to be waiting.

The parable of the unfaithful steward is one of the greatest importance. It shows that some will be teaching that the time has come to get ready for Christ's coming,â€”to sell and give alms. They urge the necessity of immediate preparation for the event, while the unfaithful servant reasons that there is no necessity of being so much stirred up about the matter. He complains of the straight testimony, and he pursues the course of those who do not profess the truth at all; yet he claims to believe the same as the others, but in his heart he does not, and he shows it in two ways: First, he says that the preaching to move at once and act as though the day of the Lord was right upon us is too strong; second, his life is the same as those who do not make any profession at all. The first is to beat his men-servants; the second, to eat and drink with the drunken.
