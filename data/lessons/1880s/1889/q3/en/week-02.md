## NOTES

Heb. 13:5 reads: "Let your conversation be without covetousness." The word conversation did not mean when the Bible was translated what it now does. It is now generally used to denote verbal intercourse between persons, familiar talks, etc., whereas it formerly meant, "behavior, conduct, deportment," and that is what it means in the above passage. The Greek word translated conversation in this text is tropos, and is defined by Bagster as "mode, manner, way;" "turn of mind or action, habit, disposition." And this is the meaning that the word conversation has in every place where it occurs in the Scriptures, with the exception of Phil. 1:27 and 3:20, in which texts it means citizenship. But these meanings take nothing from the word as applied to our verbal intercourse or the words which we speak; for "way, manner of life, behavior," certainly include our words.

Covetousness is an unlawful desire. It is classed among the worst of sins, for it is directly opposed to every principle of the gospel of Christ. The plan of salvation rests wholly on Heaven's gift to man. It was a gift of infinite love, and was at an infinite sacrifice. When there is one single prompting of that spirit in the soul, it so far makes men unselfish and generous. The two spirits are as far apart as Heaven and hell, as light and darkness. No man possessing the spirit of covetousness is fit to bear any responsibility in a work so sacred as that which is laid in such an infinite cost. Every attempt to advance it by such a person would only mar the work. Our efforts are weakened by such a spirit. It paralyzes the greatest effort. But the smallest act and the feeblest effort clothed with the spirit of appreciation of the gift of Heaven, has a power beyond description. It conquers Satan every time, and only works good. God would have his people despise covetousness, and cultivate the opposite spirit.

In 1 Cor. 5:11 we are told not to keep company or even eat with certain characters, and among others are mentioned covetous persons. The keeping company is walking in church-fellowship, and eating is at the communion table. No stronger language could be used to show how God regards that sin. The tenth verse shows that we will have to mingle with them in this world as long as we are in it. But to take them into Christian fellowship is contrary to the principles of this gospel of Christ.

Mankind are naturally selfish, but the grace of Christ is unselfish. It is a heavenly plant growing only in that heart which has been renewed. It is a jealous principle, and will admit of no rival. It makes a lovely character, admired by all. It cannot live without action, and every act increases, strengthens, and extends it. The unconverted heart cannot originate or produce this plant of heavenly growth, which lives and flourishes only where Christ reigns. If this spirit of unselfishness is nourished, it will prove an evergreen. Its branches will not decay; its leaves will not wither. It is immortal, eternal, watered continually with the dews of Heaven.

But covetousness is the reverse of all this. It withers the soul; it dries up every liberal feeling; paralyzes unselfish emotions; prevents every generous act, and while it may say, Yes, yes, to the opposite principles, there is nothing that can move the individual to action. This is covetousness. It should be hated as we would hate poison, and dreaded as we would dread the bite of a deadly viper. It should not be so much as named among saints.
