## NOTE

Christ's position with the Father, being equal to him, made him the only being who could pay the penalty of the broken law. He was first and the best that Heaven possessed. The first religious services of which we have any account were the bringing of offerings and sacrifices by man. The sin-offering was a lamb without blemish, for it represented Christ. Men were also to bring the first-fruits of everything which they received, as a wave, or thank-offering to God. By withholding these offerings, they robbed God, and showed that they did not appreciate the sacrifice that Heaven had made for their salvation. We do not read in so many words in the New Testament that men were to bring the first-fruits of all they received as an offering to God, but the apostle, in writing his second epistle to the Corinthians, referred directly to their offerings, and taught them to believe that God would help to make up their offerings if they had willing hearts, even to the working of a miracle such as was wrought in the supplying of an omer of manna to each man in the wilderness. Certainly no one can read the eighth and ninth chapters of Second Corinthians without feeling that the apostle attaches great importance to this matter of weekly offerings. More than this, it is an institution owned and approved directly by God himself; and none will be poorer in this life for following the instruction thus given; but it will secure to them promises that they otherwise would fail to receive.

Another important thought gathered from these chapters is that the apostles would not have the brethren give because they felt compelled to, but from choice. This spirit is a most precious gift of the grace of Christ. The natural feeling, to see that self is cared for first, arises from a love of self more than from a love for the cause of Christ; but to do for the cause of Christ first, arises from a heart renewed by the grace of God.
