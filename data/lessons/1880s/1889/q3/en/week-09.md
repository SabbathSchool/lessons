## NOTE

Christ's joy will be in bringing many souls into glory (Heb. 2:10); it was for this that he became obedient unto death, and it is declared (Isa. 53:11) that "he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied," and all who are saved will be partakers with him; to each one it will be said, "Well done, good and faithful servant;" "enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Matt. 25:23. But Christ labored and suffered for the salvation of souls, and if we share the glory we must also share the labor and the suffering. As it is written (2 Tim. 2:12), "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us." To deny Christ it is not necessary that we say in words, as did Peter, "I know not the man," but we may deny him by refusing to suffer hardship or self-denial for his sake or in his cause. To acknowledge Christ is to serve and obey him in all things, and this we cannot do without, to some extent, suffering with him.
