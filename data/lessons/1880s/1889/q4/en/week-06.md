### Notes

When the house of Israel is spoken of in distinction from the household of faith, we shall greatly mistake if we suppose that faith was not required of Israel. It will be seen by the whole argument in this letter that it was. There have never been two systems of salvation. As children of the covenant of Abraham, of which their circumcision was the token (John 7:22; Gen. 17:10-14), they were under covenant obligation to have the faith of Abraham.

The rest to which the children of Israel were journeying, was the land of Canaan. To the two tribes and a half who chose their land on the east of Jordan, Moses said: "The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, . . . until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath given them beyond Jordan." Deut. 3:18-20. Again: "For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the Lord your God giveth you." Deut. 12:9. The rest and the inheritance are the same. Joshua led them over Jordan, and to the two tribes and a half he said: "The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. . . . Ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them; until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them." Josh. 1:13-15. When all was accomplished, the record says: "And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. And the Lord gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers; and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them." Josh. 21:43, 44. The rest unto which the Lord was leading them, and which they who fell in the wilderness never entered into, was the peaceable possession of the land of Canaan—the land of promise.
