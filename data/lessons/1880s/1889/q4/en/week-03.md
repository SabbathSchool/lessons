### Notes

Scholars should be taught, and it should be impressed upon their minds, that, in studying the Bible, they should pay no attention to the divisions of chapters. They often break the connection in a manner to cause the reader to lose much of the force of the Scriptures.

"The word spoken by angels." It is certain that when the law was given on Mount Sinai, there were present myriads of holy ones, as it reads in Deut. 33:2. Ps. 68:17 says: "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place." The words of Stephen plainly indicate that the angels had some office to fulfill on the occasion of the giving of the law: "Who have received the law by the disposition of angels." Acts 7:53. Yet just what part they had to act, is not revealed. Professor Stuart, after noticing a number of opinions on this subject, says:—

"We may stand aloof from being thus wise above what is written, and content ourselves simply with what our author teaches us, and what the Scriptures confirm, viz., that angels did assist at the giving of the law, or were in some way employed as ministering spirits by Jehovah on the occasion of its being promulgated. This is all that the text can well be interpreted as meaning, and all that is requisite for the argument of the apostle."

These words we can adopt, and here we shall have to rest content. In this last dispensation God has spoken to us by his own Son, the Maker and Upholder of all things; and to turn away from the words of such a Being, or to hear them idly, indifferently, or carelessly, is to become guilty in the highest degree.
