### Notes

The scepter is an emblem of kingly power. A scepter of righteousness implies just what Isa. 32:1 says, "A king shall reign in righteousness." In Gal. 2:17 the apostle declares that Christ is not the minister of sin; that is, he does not serve the cause of sin; he does not advance sin. But he is the minister of righteousness, or right-doing. Compare 1 John 3:7. As the commandments of God are righteousness (Ps. 119:172), he who does righteousness keeps the law of God. See Deut. 6:25; Isa. 51:7.

Iniquity means, literally, lawlessness; workers of iniquity (see Matt. 7:23) means breakers of the law. However much we may call on the name of Christ, and profess faith in him, he will not accept us unless we also do the will of his Father; he will not accept law-breakers. While we cannot be justified, or please God, without faith (Rom. 5:1; Heb. 11:6); so faith without works is dead, being alone. James 2:17, 20. Compare Rev. 14:12.

Verses 10-12 are quoted from Psalm 102:25-27. By the reading of the psalm we could not determine that this was spoken to the Son rather than addressed to the Father. And this is the case with a number of quotations in the New Testament from the Old. We should never think of applying them to the Son of God, if Inspiration did not so apply them. And is this not an assurance to us that the Son of God occupies a much larger place in the Scriptures of the Old Testament than is generally supposed? Is it not reasonable to believe that many other texts in that book refer to him, in which he is not generally recognized? The great efforts that are being made, in these days, to do away with the Old Testament, or to weaken its authority, is a direct blow against the divinity and work of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Scriptures are not read with that carefulness and feeling of dependence on the Spirit of God that is necessary to appreciate it as a revelation of God through his Son.

"The Lord said unto my Lord." Psalm 110:1. In this text two different Hebrew words are rendered Lord. Thus the original reads: Jehovah said unto Adonai. And so in other places, as Isa. 6:3, 4, 12, Jehovah is used; in verses 1, 8, 11, it is Adonai. But this distinction is not recognized in the Greek language. As Jehovah is a proper name, and not a title, it should never be translated or rendered Lord. If it were transferred as a proper name, the distinction would be recognized in every language.

The apostle Paul tells us in Rom. 8:14 that if we are led by the Spirit of God we are the sons of God; and John (1 John 3:2) says that we are even now sons of God. The angels also are called sons of God (Job 38:7), and Luke (3:38) says that Adam was the son of God. But all these are sons in a far different sense from what Christ is. The angels are sons by creation, just as Adam was, who was created a little lower than they. But Christ is the "only begotten Son of God," having "by inheritance a more excellent name than they." We are "by nature the children of wrath" (Eph. 2:3), since we partake of the fallen nature of Adam; but we become sons by adoption, and the Spirit of God is the seal of that adoption. As adopted sons of God, we become heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. Rom. 8:14-17. We shall be allowed to share the glory and dominion of God's own Son. Well may the beloved disciple exclaim: "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God."
