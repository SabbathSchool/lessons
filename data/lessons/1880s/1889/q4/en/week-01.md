### Notes

This letter evidently was written to those who were familiar with the Scriptures—with those things which the Lord had spoken by the prophets. It is from the very beginning an argument from the Scriptures on the dignity, the messiahship, and the priesthood of Christ. It argues most conclusively the typical character of the sacrifices and services of the Levitical law, and the insufficiency of those offerings to take away sin. It was, no doubt, written "to the Hebrews," being a commentary on their laws. It contains convincing proof of the truth of the gospel as it was then preached by the apostles.

In all the other epistles, except those of John, the writers place their names at the beginning. This to the Hebrews gives no intimation of its authorship. Luther suggested that it was written by Apollos, and his suggestion has been taken up and followed by a number of writers on the continent of Europe. But we see no reason to believe that he was correct. Paul was a ready writer, having written thirteen letters under his own name, several of them of considerable length. Of Apollos as a writer we know nothing. Paul was a strong and logical reasoner. The letter to the Hebrews shows his cast of mind. Though Apollos was mighty in the Scriptures, of his style we have no possible means of judging. For ascribing this letter to Paul we have good reasons; ascribing it to Apollos is a mere conjecture without satisfactory reasons. It is a striking fact that no early writer ever suggested Apollos as its author.

This letter reminds us of the abrupt manner of the beginning of Genesis and the Gospel according to John, in announcing God and his works. It does not deal with personal, or private, or even church matters, as do the other letters. We cannot be too thankful for the instruction it contains.

The expression "these last days" does not mean the same in all places of its occurrence. When spoken before the advent of the Saviour, it generally means the last dispensation, the gospel age. Joel 2:28 is not rendered "the last days" in the English version, but Acts 2:16-20 contains an inspired comment on the text, and proves that it means the last days. The original will bear that construction. Acts 2 also shows, by the events prophesied of, that the expression there covers the entire gospel dispensation. But when spoken in this dispensation, as in 2 Tim. 3:1 and 2 Peter 3:3, it refers to the last days, or last part of this dispensation. The words of Jesus in John 6:39, 40, 44, 54, refer "the last day" to the day of his coming and the resurrection. Hence the last days of this age are the days just preceding his coming. In Heb. 1:2 the last dispensation is meant.

As God made the worlds by his Son, and all things are upheld by him, and as "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2 Cor. 5:19), it follows that we see and know absolutely nothing of God the Father, either in creation, providence, or in salvation and redemption, but what is revealed to us through his Son. The Lord Jesus Christ is, in every respect, the manifestation of God to man. "For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell." Col. 1:19.

Heb. 1:3 corresponds to Col. 1:16, 17, which says that by him, that is Jesus, "were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist." The word "consist" means, literally, "stand together;" and the text means that as Christ created all things so he preserves them; he upholds them by the word of his power—the same word that caused them to exist.
