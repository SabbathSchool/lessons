### NOTE

IN his second epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul makes the grace of Christ the grand spring of all Christian giving. Giving that is prompted by anything else is not Christian giving. As an incentive for them to give liberally, the apostle said: "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich." 2 Cor. 8:9. The plan of salvation begins and ends in a gift. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. Christ "gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Titus 2:14. And when the work of redemption shall have been completed, the saints will share a glorious immortality as the free gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

This consideration should incite to prompt and cheerful giving. Indeed, it will lead to such giving, on the part of every soul who feels the worth of the Saviour's love. Surely it is a slight thing to give the temporal riches which come from God in the first place, and belong to him, when he so freely gives to us eternal riches: "The riches of his grace" is an expression often used by the apostle Paul. But the grace of God is a gift, and consists wholly in giving; we are exhorted to be "good stewards of the manifold grace of God." 1 Peter 4:10. The spirit of willingness to give is a grace, and a manifestation of the grace of God. See 2 Cor. 8:4-7. A converted church must be a liberal church. A revival that does not increase the contributions of a church, is not the right kind of a revival; for those who, like the brethren in Macedonia, first give themselves to the Lord, will, like them, abound in liberality, even in deep poverty. See 2 Cor. 8:1-5. This is further proved by the experience of the people in the time of Hezekiah. See 2 Chron. 30 and 31, comparing especially chapter 30:18-20 and 31:4-11.
