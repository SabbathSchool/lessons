### NOTE

THE performance of any ordinance by which we are directed to show our faith in God, becomes sin whenever faith does not prompt it. Instead of then being an act of worship to God, it becomes an act of idolatry. Thus the Lord's Supper has been perverted by the Roman Catholics into the idolatrous mass, the participating in which is generally thought to secure the pardon of sin. As the Jews made an idol of the brazen serpent, which was intended as an instrument of faith, so they often, and especially in the time of Christ and later, regarded their sacrifices much as the Catholics regard the mass.
