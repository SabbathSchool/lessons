### OFFERINGS FOR SIN

1. WHAT has God represented himself as most willing to do? Isa. 55:7.
2. In what does he delight? Micah 7:18.
3. How great is his mercy? Ps. 103:11.
4. What will he do for our iniquities, and where will he put them? Micah 7:19.
5. How far does he remove our transgressions from us, if we but repent? Ps. 103:12.
6. What assurance have we of all this? Rom. 8:31, 32.
7. What is it that cleanses from sin? John 1:29; 1 John 1:7.
8. Yet what were the Israelites required to do when they committed sin? Num. 15:27, 28.
9. Tell the particulars of this sin-offering. Lev. 4:29-31.
10. In case the entire offering was burnt, what was done with the blood? Lev. 4:5-7, 11, 12.
11. What is said of the blood? Lev. 17:11, last part.
12. When only the fat of the sin-offering was burnt, what was done with the flesh? Lev. 6:26, 30.
13. In this case, what was the flesh considered as bearing into the sanctuary? Lev. 10:16, 17.
14. Was there any power in these offerings to cleanse from sin? Heb. 10:1, 4.
15. Yet were not the people actually and fully pardoned when they made these offerings? Num. 15:28; see also Lev. 4, noting especially verses 20, 26, 31, 35.
16. Then what must have been the significance of those offerings? Ans.â€”They represented the death of Christ, "who his own self bare our sins in his body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness" (1 Peter 2:24), by whose stripes we are healed. God's promise makes future things as real as though they had been already performed, and so the blood of Christ was as powerful to cleanse from sin in the days of Moses as it is now. The sin-offerings that the people brought, simply showed their faith that the Lord had laid upon Jesus the iniquity of us all, and that there is cleansing in his blood. It was by faith that all sacrifices that were of any value were made. Heb. 11:4. It was faith that made the people whole in those days, as well as in the days of Christ, or at the present time; and without faith it was as impossible to please God then as it is now.
17. If there was not true repentance, would any sacrifice avail? Ps. 66:18.
18. What does the Lord require of us? Hosea 6:6; Micah 6:6-8.
19. What are the real sacrifices of God? Ps. 51:16, 17.

### NOTE

WHEN the Lord says, "For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice," and David says, "Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; thou delightest not in burnt-offering," we must understand it as meaning that God never had any delight in sacrifices and burnt-offering unaccompanied by a contrite spirit; for immediately after David said what we have just quoted from him, he added: "Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering." The meaning is that God is not pleased with mere form and soulless ceremony. He does not desire a person to do penance, and his favor cannot be bought by any amount of treasure, or affliction of one's body. See Micah 6:6-8. But he is pleased with a broken and contrite heart; and such a heart will say from the fullness of its sense of the divine mercy, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people." Ps. 116:12-14.
