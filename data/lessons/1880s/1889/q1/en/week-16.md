9. What do we read of the real throne of God? Ps. 11:4; 99:1; see also Eze. 1.
10. Since the tabernacle was a figure of the true sanctuary in Heaven, what must have been signified by the ark with its covering, from which God spoke? Ans.—The throne of God in Heaven.
11. What was placed in the ark in the earthly sanctuary? Ex. 25:16, 21; Deut. 10:4, 5.
12. Remembering that everything about the earthly sanctuary was a representation of things in the heavens, what must we conclude from the fact that the tables containing the ten commandments were placed in the ark, from above which God spoke? Ans.—That the law of God—the ten commandments—is underneath the throne of God in Heaven.

17. To what would the abolition of the law of God be equivalent? Ans.—To the overthrow of the Government of God.
18. Then is it conceivable that the law can be abolished or changed?

### NOTE

IT is absolutely inconceivable that the law of God should be abolished, or changed in the slightest particular. It is the righteousness of God, and that cannot be different from what it is. It is his will, and God changes not. It is the foundation of his throne, his Government, and that cannot change, because he is "from everlasting to everlasting." There is just one thing that the Bible declares that God cannot do: "He cannot deny himself." He cannot be other than he is. And so it is absolutely impossible for the omnipotent God himself to change or abrogate his law, for in so doing he would deny himself; he would change his character, his will, and his Government, and would cease to be God. But this is inconceivable; and so we repeat that it is absolutely inconceivable that the law of God should be abolished or changed.
