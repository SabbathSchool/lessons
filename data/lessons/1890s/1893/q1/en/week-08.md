### NOTE

Some of the operations of the Spirit are brought out in this lesson. God's Spirit dwells in his word (compare John 3:5 with James 1:18 and 1 Peter 1:23), and it is through this agency that it reproves the world. The Spirit is an instructor (Neh. 9:23), to teach all things (John 14:26), according to the promise (John 6:45), and to testify of Christ (John 15:26). It is the agent in inspiration (2 Peter 1:21), testified in the prophets (1 Peter 1:11), and is to speak in those who are persecuted (Matt. 10:19, 20). Through the word it witnesses that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16) and lifts up a standard against the enemy (Isa. 59:19). The Spirit strives with men (Gen. 6:3), helps in prayer (Rom. 8:26; Jude 20; Eph. 6:18), and guides them in the right way (Isa. 30:21). It renews (Titus 3:5), quickens (1 Peter 3:18), and sanctifies (2 Thess. 2:13). The practical importance of receiving the Spirit is apparent, as we see the part which it acts in God's purpose concerning man.

"The Holy Spirit exalts and glorifies the Saviour. It is his office to present Christ, the purity of his righteousness, and the great salvation that we have through him. Jesus says, 'He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.' The Spirit of truth is the only effectual teacher of divine truth. How must God esteem the human race, since he gave his Son to die for them, and appoints his Spirit to be man's teacher and continual guide." â€”Steps to Christ, page 105.
