### NOTES

1. No attempt will be made in these lessons to define the Holy Spirit. The subject will be considered from the practical rather than from the theoretical side. We know that it is omnipresent. Ps. 139:7-12. We know that it is the eternal Spirit. Heb. 9:14. We know that it is the Comforter (John 14:26), and the Spirit of truth (John 15:26). These names are given because there is comfort in the truth. It is of much more importance to us that we receive the Spirit than that we try to discern what it is. "Holy Ghost" and "Holy Spirit" are from the same original words, and seem to be used interchangeably in the King James' Version. The American members of the Revision Committee desired to use in all cases the term "Holy Spirit."

2. Faith in Christ makes us children of God (Gal. 3:26), and the Spirit is given because we are sons (Gal. 4:6); and so Paul asked the believers if they had received the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:2). All things are ours (1 Cor. 3:22), but God does not give spiritual blessings against our will, and so we are to ask (Matt. 7:7) for the Spirit, with the assurance that he will give willingly (Luke 11:13). This the disciples did (Acts 1:5, 14), and their request was granted (Acts 2:4). The promise that was fulfilled to them (Joel 2:28, 29) is for us also. The possession of the Spirit indicates a union with God (1 John 3:24; 4:13), and no one can be Christ's without it (Rom. 8:9). Christ bestowed it upon his disciples (John 20:21, 22), and we are exhorted to be filled with it (Eph. 5:18). We receive it by faith. Gal. 3:2.

"Just prior to his leaving his disciples for the heavenly courts, Jesus encouraged them with the promise of the Holy Spirit. This promise belongs to us as much as it did to them, and yet how rarely is it presented before the people, and its reception spoken of in the church. In consequence of this silence upon this most important theme, what promise do we know less about by its practical fulfillment than this rich promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit, whereby efficiency is to be given to all our spiritual labor? This promised blessing, if claimed by faith, would bring all other blessings in its train, and it is to be given liberally to the people of God. Through the cunning devices of the enemy the minds of God's people seem to be incapable of comprehending and appropriating the promises of God. They seem to think that only the scantiest showers of grace are to fall upon the thirsty soul. . . . The power of God awaits their demand and reception. . . .

"The Christian must build upon the foundation if he would build a strong, symmetrical character, if he would be well balanced in his religious experience. It is in this way that the man will be prepared to meet the demands of truth and righteousness, as they are represented in the Bible; for he will be sustained and energized by the Holy Spirit of God. He who is a true Christian combines great tenderness of feeling with great firmness of purpose, with unswerving fidelity to God; he will in no case become the betrayer of sacred trusts. He who is endowed with the Holy Spirit has great capacities of heart and intellect, with strength of will and purpose that is unconquerable." â€”Mrs. E. G. White
