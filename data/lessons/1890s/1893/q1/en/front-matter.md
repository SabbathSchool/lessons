# Lessons on the Word and Spirit
FOR SENIOR CLASSES

December 31, 1892, to March 25, 1893

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The object of this series of lessons is that we may learn what the word of God is, and what blessings may come to us through it. They are not prepared in order to prove that the Bible is true, but are intended for those who believe that it is the word of God, and they are designed to bring out and illustrate what it says about itself. It is hoped, therefore, that they will enlarge the understanding, and strengthen the faith of those who do believe. We should have the same confidence in what the word of God says about itself as in what it teaches upon any other subject, and we should always remember that the Scripture is given to instruct our reason, and not to be judged by it. We are to believe what God says to us, not because we can understand it and see the reason for it, but because God says so. When we demand a full understanding of every statement before accepting it, we exalt ourselves to an equality with God, bring him down to our level, and make him such as ourselves. When the matter is viewed properly, the mysteries of the Bible are among the strong proofs that it is the word of God. Our attitude should always be, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth;" but our hearing should be with the purpose of yielding to it. God says that he looks to him who trembleth at his word. Reverence and humility should characterize us while we wait in the audience chamber of the great Creator, to hear his word.

The plan of developing the lesson differs somewhat from that which has heretofore been adopted, and this is done with a purpose. The design is to encourage the study of the scriptures used as the basis of the lesson, and others related to them, for spiritual benefit, rather than merely to learn the lesson to recite it. One who gets the subject in mind will have no difficulty in answering any question properly connected with it. Each teacher can make such use of the notes as he wishes. Questions can be framed covering the thoughts presented if that is deemed to be desirable. The "suggestive questions" will open the way for further work when it may be thought profitable.
