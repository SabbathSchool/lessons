### NOTE

It is worse than useless to speculate on the process of the new birth. It is our privilege, however, to know the fact. "Like the wind, which is invisible, yet the effects of which are plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon the human heart. That regenerating power which no human eye can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new being in the image of God." To know God (John 17:3), or to be known of him (Gal. 4:9), involves that idea of that generative power of the Holy Spirit which creates a new heart (Ps. 51:10). The birth of Christ, in whom God was manifested (2 Cor. 5:19), and who is God with us (Matt. 1:25), was due to the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35); so we are begotten of God through his word (James 1:18), are born of his Spirit (John 3:3, 5), are sons now (1 John 3:1, 2), receive power by the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8). Religion is not a mere sentiment, but a life; and the mystery of godliness (or the "secret of piety") is that as God dwelt and worked in Christ (John 14:10), and in him condemned sin in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), so Christ shall dwell in us (Eph. 3:17), and live in us (Gal. 2:20), being with us always (Matt. 28:20), enabling us to do all things (Phil. 4:13). All this new life and power come through the Holy Spirit (Eph. 3:16), which is to dwell in us (John 14:17). Thus it was that after Christ left his disciples, "their union with him was closer than when he was personally with them." Thus we become a habitation of God (Eph. 2:22), a spiritual house (1 Peter 2:5; Heb. 3:6), a temple of God in which he dwells (2 Cor. 6:16).
