### NOTE

The Revised Version of 1 Peter 4:10 reads: "According as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." God's grace is here said to be manifold, because manifested in so many ways in the church of God, even as the many angled glass object reflects the light shining upon it and through it. This grace comes through the gracious Spirit of God (Eph. 4:7; 1 Cor. 12:4); these gifts of God's Spirit are given to everyone who is Christ's (Rom. 8:9; Eph. 4:7), to profit, or increase (1 Cor. 12:7), divided not according to the will of the man, but the wisdom of the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:11); these gifts were bestowed upon the church when Jesus left this world (Eph. 4:8), for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body, or church of Christ (verse 12); and these gifts will continue according to the measure of faith and consecration of the church till the perfect day, or till Christ comes (1 Cor. 13:8-10; Eph. 4:13). Some of these gifts are mentioned in Rom. 12:6-8; 1 Cor. 12:8-10, 28; Eph. 4:11.

In Luke 19:12-17 these gifts are by our Lord called pounds (the highest denomination of Roman money); in Matt. 25:14-30 they are called talents (the highest denomination in Jewish money), thus showing their great value. These talents and pounds are given by the same one that gave the gifts, to the same ones, at the same time, for the same purpose, to continue the same length of time; they are therefore the same. The solemn importance of this stewardship is given in these parables; they should be studied in connection with this lesson. Does anyone think he has no gift? Let him be assured if he is the Master's "own servant," he will be given according to his ability to use. Matt. 25:14, 15. Ours is the consecration; God is the giver.
