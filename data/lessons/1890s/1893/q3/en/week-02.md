### NOTES

1. Have Inquired.—The holy men of old certainly knew the salvation of Christ personally. (See Gen. 49:18; Ex. 15:2; Ps. 9:14; 51:12.) In fact, the whole inspired psalmody of Israel breathes of the salvation of God, both present and future. Yet they did not understand the plan of salvation in its fuller development, as did and do those of the Christian era. This is expressly declared in the scripture (verse 12), in the prophets themselves (Dan. 12:4, 9), by Christ (Matt. 13:16, 17), by the apostles (Rom. 16:25, 26; Eph. 3:5); but this understanding was not necessary, for God by his Spirit spoke through them things which they did not know nor understand. They were the instruments; it was the Spirit of Christ which was in them that testified, not the prophets themselves. The Spirit of God knows the mind and thoughts of God (1 Cor. 2:11), and therefore it was necessary that the Spirit of God must give the words which should convey the thoughts of God to future generations (2 Sam. 23:2; see also 1 Cor. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Peter 1:2).

2. The Revised Version gives a thought in the rendering of this verse which ought to be considered in its study; it reads: "Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is being brought [marginal, Greek] unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." Note, the "girding" is not a single act, but a constant work, a binding up with the truth of God (Eph. 6:14), as that truth is constantly revealed in the onward path of the Christian (Phil. 3:15, 16). And note also that this grace is not all future, but is constantly flowing from a full fountain to which we have access by faith (Rom. 5:2), as Christ is revealed to us more and more in his word; for to the faithful Christian student of the word is constantly revealed new manifestations of the glory of the Master (2 Cor. 4:6), which will increase from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18), until the day of the revealing of the glory of his presence (2 Thess. 1:7, 10; 2:8), when his people shall be made like him (Phil. 3:20, 21; 1 John 3:2).
