### NOTES

1. Wives, Husbands.—Such instructions as are here given are frequently laughed at or sneered about even by those who profess the name of Christ. An unwise, overbearing husband has pressed them too far, or an obstinate, self-willed, worldly-minded wife has rebelled against them; but it is well to remember that these words are the words of God, to be listened to or studied with reverence, knowing that we must meet them in the judgment. Subjection to a husband does not mean slavish homage, but the simple respect due to him whom God and nature has placed first as head and protector of the family. The very name husband—house-band—indicates a binding together, not a lording over. Husbands should love their wives as their own selves (Eph. 5:25, 28), and should not be bitter against them (Col. 3:19), dwelling with them not as objects of lust, or slaves to their passions or whims, but according to the knowledge revealed in the word of God and the condition of the wife, giving them honor (1) because they are the weaker sex, (2) because they are heirs together of the grace of life. Wives are to submit to their husbands as is fit in the Lord (Col. 3:18), to defer to them in matters that do not violate conscience or cause the wife to dishonor God, never disparaging them in the eyes of their children or others. She should be modest, prudent, economical. If these feelings and affections exist, God will be honored, and their united prayers put up to him for their children and various blessings will not be hindered.
