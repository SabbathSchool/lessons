### NOTES

1. The practical duties enjoined in this lesson are those which are very apt to be overlooked. Honor All Men.—"Some are not worthy of honor," says one; neither are we. We are by nature the same as they (Eph. 2:3; Ps. 51:5); all were made originally in the likeness of the same God as much as we (James 3:9); all are bought by the same precious blood of Christ (1 Tim. 2:6); all are therefore for Christ's sake entitled to the same esteem and honor. Love the Brotherhood.—A closer, deeper affection than for all men, bound together by the life and presence of Christ (John 17:23). Fear God.—The fear of the Lord, not cringing or slavish fear, but loving reverence, is the foundation of wisdom. He who knows God most, fears and loves him most. Honor the King.—Under God he is your ruler; honor his office and respect his authority. See verse 15 of the lesson chapter.
