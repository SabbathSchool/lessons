## NOTES:

1. VERSES 26-29.—Paul warned the church of future trouble (Acts 20:29), and this apostasy began in his day (2 Thess. 2:7). Jude writes very strongly concerning these deceivers (Jude 4, 10-13), who abounded before John's death (2 John 7). The Holy Spirit, which was promised by Christ (John 16:7), and had been poured upon them (Acts 2:33), would teach them the truth (John 16:13), and would protect them from deceivers (Acts 10:19, 20). Jesus says, "Abide in me." These words convey the idea of rest, stability, confidence. See the lesson in John 15:4-7. Such a life brings conformity to the divine character (2 Cor. 3:18) and confidence at his coming (Isa. 25:9). "God is righteous. . . . And if so, then the source of righteousness. When, therefore, a man doeth righteousness, we know . . . that the source of his righteousness is God: that in consequence he has acquired by new birth from God that righteousness which he had not by nature. We argue from his doing righteousness to his having been begotten of God. . . . The whole mass of Socinian and Pelagian commentators have reversed the members of the argument, and made it conclude that doing righteousness is the condition, on our part, of becoming a child of God. Roman Catholic expositors . . . go equally wrong, in understanding hath been begotten, not as the statement of a past abiding fact, but as the ground of a confidence as to the future." —Alford, Lee & Shepard, edition 1883.

2. VERSES 1-3.—"It would require the language of the Infinite to express the love that has made it possible for us to be called the sons of God. Faith makes us children of God (Gal. 3:26), and this is a present experience. The Holy Spirit belongs to the sons of God (Gal. 4:6), who are also heirs (Rom. 8:17) of the inheritance. In fact, "all things" belong to them (1 Cor. 3:21). The world knew not Christ (John 1:10) nor the Father (John 17:25), and for this reason (John 16:3) will persecute true Christians (John 15:18-20).

This present life is the time for the perfect character. "If you give yourself to him and accept him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for his sake you are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in the place of your character, and you are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned." The character is fixed at the coming of Christ (Rev. 22:11), who "shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory" (Phil. 3:21, R. V.), and thus shall we "appear with him in glory" (Col. 3:4). So shall we be satisfied. Ps. 17:15. Holiness is required of those who shall see God (Heb. 12:14), and this privilege is promised to the pure in heart (Matt. 5:8); but "who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?" Prov. 20:9. It is by faith (Acts 15:9) which works (Gal. 5:6) in obedience (1 Peter 2:22) that we are purified. "He who hath this hope in him learns from the Scriptures that he must be a worker together with God."
