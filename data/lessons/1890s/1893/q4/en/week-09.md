## NOTES.

1. VERSES 7-11.—"Whenever the life of God is in the hearts of men, it will flow out to others in love and blessing." "Of God he hath been begotten and doth know God," is Dr. Young's rendering of the last clause of verse 7. The new birth is a past experience, but knowing God is always a present experience. It is not only true that God loves and is the source of love, but "God is love," and this is the essence of the whole gospel. There can be no discord in the home, the church, or the community when the love of God abides in all hearts. God's love to us is not simply an abstract thing, but it was shown in a most practical way. John 3:16. Man lost his life by sin (Gen. 2:17), and Christ came to restore life (John 10:10), which is wholly the gift of God (Rom. 6:23). "Had not God specially interposed, Satan and man would have entered into an alliance against heaven, and, instead of cherishing enmity against Satan, the whole human family would have been united in opposition to God." "The reconciliation of mercy and justice did not involve any compromise with sin, or ignore any claim of justice; but, by giving to each divine attribute its ordained place, mercy could be exercised in the punishment of sinful, impenitent man without destroying its clemency or forfeiting its compassionate character, and justice could be exercised in forgiving the repenting transgressor without violating its integrity." "Said the angel, 'Think ye that the Father yielded up his beloved Son without a struggle? No, no. It was even a struggle with the God of heaven, whether to let guilty man perish, or to give his beloved Son to die for him."

2. VERSES 12-14.—Men cannot see God with the natural eye, but they ought to see his character wrought out in Christians. "Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through his works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of his goodness, and be won to love and serve him." The Spirit is given to those who ask for it (Luke 11:13), but the asking must be in the name of Jesus (John 16:23, 24). "But to pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a mere mention of that name at the beginning and ending of a prayer. It is to pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe his promises, rely upon his grace, and work his works." The purpose of Christ in coming to this world was to save (Luke 19:10), not to judge (John 12:47); but rejection of his work results in condemnation (John 3:18). The price paid was sufficient to redeem the world, but no man is saved contrary to his own will and choice. We can do nothing without him (John 15:5), and he will do nothing without us. Christ sends his followers on the same errand which brought him to earth (John 20:21), and has promised his presence to them (Matt. 28:20). "As Jesus has revealed to us the true character of the Father, so we are to reveal Christ to a world that does not know his tender, pitying love."
