### NOTES

1. "Those who would have destroyed Christ and his faithful people, now witness the glory which rests upon them. In the midst of their terror they hear the voices of the saints in joyful strains exclaiming, 'Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us.'" —Great Controversy, page 644.

2. It would be impossible to have a literal reward if Christ's coming was secret. If no one knew when he had come, they would not know whether they had the reward or not.

3. "The King of kings descends upon the cloud, wrapped in flaming fire. The heavens are rolled together as a scroll, the earth trembles before him, and every mountain and island is moved out of its place." Ps. 50:3, 4; Rev. 6:15-17; 2 Thess. 1:7, 8. "The derisive jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed into silence; the clash of arms, the tumult of battle, with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood (Isa. 9:5), is stilled. Naught now is heard but the voice of prayer and the sound of weeping and lamentation. The cry bursts forth from lips so lately scoffing, 'The great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?' The wicked pray to be buried beneath the rocks of the mountains, rather than meet the face of Him whom they have despised and rejected." —Great Controversy, page 642.
