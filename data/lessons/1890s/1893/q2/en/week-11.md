### NOTES

1. The word "Babylon" is from Babel, which means confusion. When applied to a body of professors, would signify that they were not united in the faith they held. By studying Rev. 14:6-12 it will be seen that the term is applied to a people that live just before the Lord comes. See verse 14. They have not only become confused as to what the true faith is, but, by unlawful connection with the world, they have fallen from what they know to be right. Dr. Adam Clarke expresses their condition in his comments on 2 Tim. 3:5, when he says, "Who have all their religion in their creed, confession of faith, etc., while they may be destitute of the life of God in their souls." There are several hundred denominations in the land that profess to take the Bible as the foundation of their faith; yet each one condemns all the rest, showing a state of confusion that turns sinners from the word of God. With their confusion they have so far retrograded from their original that it can be truthfully said, "Babylon is fallen."

2. Although the world denounces the fallen state of the church in the last days, God has not yet taken his Spirit wholly from them. He at one time blessed them, because they were living up to the light they had. Then they brought sinners into the fold and were blessed in their work. But in turning to the world, the honest-hearted ones are still there, but do not enjoy the state of things they see. Finally the Spirit will be withdrawn.
