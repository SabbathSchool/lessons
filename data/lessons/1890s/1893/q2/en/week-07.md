### NOTES

1. There have been a great many tribulations through which God's people have had to pass. If the Saviour had only spoken of a tribulation, we should have been at a loss to know which one he meant. But he connects with it three specifications that locate it beyond a doubt; first, it is a great tribulation; second, there never was one like it before, nor ever will be another like it again; third, there is a certain time called "days" allotted to it.

2. There is one persecution, and only one, that meets the demands of the Saviour's words, and that is found in the papal persecution, from A.D. 538 to 1798. It was great in extent and severity. There never was a time when so many of God's people sealed their testimony with their blood. About fifty million people suffered martyrdom at the hands of this power. According to other prophecies it was to have authority over the saints for "time, times, and dividing of times" (Dan. 7:25; Rev. 12:14); twelve hundred and sixty days (Rev. 12:6); or forty-two months (Rev. 13:5), which literally signifies twelve hundred and sixty years. See "Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation."

3. The days began with the subjection of the Ostrogoths in A.D. 538, and, continuing twelve hundred and sixty years, would close A.D. 1798, when the Papacy as a persecutor was overthrown.

4. The empress of Austria was the first European ruler to issue an edict of tolerance to Christianity, which took place in A.D. 1776. Owing to the work of the reformers, persecution ceased in the other States about the same time.

5. "In the month of May, 1780, there was a terrific dark day in New England, 'when all faces seemed to gather blackness,' and the people were filled with fear. There was great distress in the village where Edward Lee lived, 'men's hearts failing them for fear' that the judgment day was at hand; and the neighbors all flocked around the holy man, who spent the gloomy hours in earnest prayer for the distressed multitude." —American Tract Society, Tract No. 379, Life of Edward Lee. "Candles were lighted in many houses, birds were silent and disappeared, fowls retired to roost. It was the general opinion that the day of judgment was at hand." —President Dwight, in Connecticut Historical Collection.

6. The evening that followed the dark day which should have had the light of a full moon, was shrouded in inky darkness. In the latter part of the night, the moon was visible, but had the appearance of blood. See Rev. 6:12.
