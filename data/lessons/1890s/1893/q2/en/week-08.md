### NOTES

1. "This language of the prophet (Rev. 6:13) has always been received as metaphorical. Yesterday it was literally fulfilled. The ancients understood by 'aster' in Greek and 'stella' in Latin the smaller lights of heaven. The refinement of modern astronomy has made the distinction between stars of heaven and meteors of heaven. Therefore, the idea of the prophet as it is expressed in the original Greek, was literally fulfilled in the phenomena of yesterday." —Henry Dana Ward, in Journal of Commerce, November 15, 1833.

2. "The meteoric phenomenon which occurred on the morning of the 13th of November last, was of so extraordinary and interesting a character as to be entitled to more than a mere passing notice... The lively and graphic descriptions which have appeared in various public journals do not exceed the reality. No language, indeed, can come up to the splendor of that magnificent display, and I hesitate not to say that no one who did not witness it can form an adequate conception of its glory. It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon, and yet they were not exhausted, thousands swiftly following in the track of thousands, AS IF CREATED FOR THE OCCASION." —Christian Advocate and Journal, Dec. 13, 1833.

3. There is a record of not less than sixteen star showers between 902 and 1868 A.D. None of those previous to 1780 could be the one referred to by the Saviour. Since that date we have a record of six of these showers that have been noticed in different parts of the world. The skeptic may ask, "How can you know which of these is the fulfillment of the prophecy?" This is easily determined by reading Rev. 6:13. It is the one in which the stars fall as untimely figs. This was true only of the one in 1833. The astronomers speak of the shower of 1833 as the most important one that has yet been seen.

4. We have a record of more disastrous storms and fires, extraordinary sights in the heavens, and famines and pestilences within the last half century than has ever been seen in the same length of time before. There may have been times when some ONE of these may have been greater, but, taking the combination, it can be truly said that there has never yet been a half century that contained so many destructive agencies which were at work at the same time to bring distress upon the earth. See "Facts for the Times," pp. 134-136.

5. "The tidal disturbances are the most remarkable and extensive of which there is any record. It is said their velocity was about ONE THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR. Both the great ocean waters of the Atlantic and Pacific have been agitated in their whole extent. We mention in particular the tidal waves at St. Thomas and all the neighboring islands, which were FULL FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT... It is said by those who have witnessed these waves that the ocean's ROAR IS EXCEEDINGLY FRIGHTFUL." —New York Tribune of Nov. 12, 1868. See "Facts for the Times," pp. 149, 150.

6. "In the education of the intellect mankind has made great strides since the birth of this century. Whether we regard the number taught or the knowledge imparted, the progress made has been marvelous." —Horace Greeley.

7. REAPER and mower, 1833; telegraph, electrotype, and phonography, 1837; photography, 1839; electric light and sewing machine, 1846; submarine cable, 1851; telephone, 1876; phonograph, 1877; audiphone, 1881.

8. From the record in Matthew 24, it might be inferred that the period spoken of as "this generation" might begin with the darkening of the sun; but when we compare this with the record of Luke 21, we see that the generation must begin later than the darkening of the sun. He mentions the sun, moon, and stars, then adds, "And upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things that are coming upon the earth." Then he says, "When ye see these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh." The beginning of the signs was seen in the sun, moon, and it may be the falling of the stars. After speaking of the figure, he says: "So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."
