NOTE.â€”If this lesson were entitled "Paul's First Missionary Tour," it would more nearly express the fact in the case than it now does. That would not be really correct either, for when Paul went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, preaching the word, he was just as truly on a missionary journey as at this time. Those who, after the death of Stephen, went everywhere preaching the word, were on a missionary journey just as surely as Paul and Barnabas were. Philip was on a missionary journey when he came to Samaria, and it was when he was on a missionary trip that the eunuch was converted. All these men were Christians, and were preaching Christ. And it was before Paul was even converted. So it is evidently a misnomer to entitle this lesson "The First Christian Missionaries."
