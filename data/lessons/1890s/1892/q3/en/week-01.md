# Lesson 1 - July 2, 1892
## The Ascension of Christ
### Acts 1:1-12 (Memory Verses, 8-11)

**Golden Text**: "When he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight." Acts 1:9.

1. To whom was the book of the Acts of the Apostles addressed? Acts 1:1.
2. What previous treatise was addressed to Theophilus? Luke 1:3, 4.
3. Then who was the writer of the book of Acts?
4. What does Luke say his former treatise contained? Acts 1:1, 2.
5. What ground does this allow for the supposition that there were some things that Jesus communicated to his disciples, which are not recorded?

**Note**: The writer of the book of Acts says that in his previous treatise he recorded all that Jesus began to do and teach, up to the very day that he ascended. This does not mean that he recorded every word and act that Jesus said and did, for that would have been impossible. See John 21:25. We have not every thing that Jesus said in regard to any doctrine, but we have every doctrine that he taught. Of course the assumption that Jesus taught certain things that are now held, which are not contained in the New Testament, is folly. For if a thing is not recorded, nobody can know anything about it; but this text expressly tells us that no truth that Jesus gave utterance to has been omitted by the evangelists. As Paul afterwards said of himself (Acts 20:20), they kept back nothing that was profitable.

6. How long was Jesus with his disciples after his resurrection? Acts 1:3.
7. What did he do in this time? Ib.
8. While they were together, what command did he give them? Verse 4.
9. To what promise did he refer? Verse 5.
10. What record have we of their having had this promise? John 14:16, 26; 15:26.
11. At the close of the forty days, when the disciples met with Jesus, what did they ask him? Acts 1:6.
12. To what was this question equivalent?

**Note**: In the beginning God created man to have "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Gen. 1:26-28; Ps. 8:6-8. The whole earth, therefore, was his kingdom, but when man fell he lost his dominion, so that, as the apostle says, "Now we see not yet all things put under him." Heb. 2:8. This inheritance was promised to Abraham and his seed (Rom. 4:13), and also to David, whose throne God said should endure forever. The one through whom David's throne is to be perpetuated is Christ (see Luke 1:31-33; Acts 2:29, 30), whose possession is to be the "uttermost parts of the earth." Ps. 2:7, 8. Because of the wickedness of David's successors, the kingdom (that is, the whole earth) was given to Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 27:2-7), and after him to other people, no more to be controlled by David's line until the coming of Christ, to whom it rightly belongs. See Eze. 21:25-27. The control of the earth by heathen kings, and the taking of it by the Lord Jesus Christ, are described in Dan. 2:37-44. This kingdom is received from the Father by Christ while in heaven, for he likened himself to a nobleman going into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return after having received the kingdom. Luke 19:12-15. So when he comes the second time he comes in his kingdom. Matt. 25:31; 2 Tim 4:1. He subdues it by destroying the wicked from out of it (Ps. 2:9; Matt. 13:41, 42), and then the righteous inherit the dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, and delight themselves forever in the abundance of peace (Dan. 7:27; Ps. 37:9-11; Matt. 13:43). So when the disciples asked if Christ would at that time restore the kingdom of Israel, they were asking if that was the time when they should be taken to reign with him in glory. From the prophets they knew that glory was to follow the suffering of Christ (1 Peter 1:11), but how long after the suffering before the glory would follow, even the prophets themselves did not know. That time is in God's own power, and he has not revealed it to any. What he says to all is, Watch.

13. What reply did Jesus make? Acts 1:7.
14. What did he say they would receive when the Holy Spirit came upon them? Verse 8.
15. In this strength what were they to do? Ib.
16. When did this conversation take place? Luke 24:49, 50.
17. What did Jesus do when they reached Bethany? Verse 50.

19. While the disciples were looking toward heaven as Jesus went up, who stood by them? Verse 10.
20. What did these angels say to them? Verse 11.
21. Since a cloud received Jesus when he ascended, and he is to come again as he went, how must he come? Matt. 24:30.
22. Since the cloud that received Jesus, diminishing in size as it receded, was the last thing seen by the disciples, what must be the "sign of the Son of Man in heaven?"
23. Did Jesus ascend secretly or openly? Acts 1:9.
24. Then, since he is to come "in like manner" as he ascended, how must it be when he comes? Rev. 1:7.
25. Did the angels leave it doubtful as to who would return? Acts 1:11.
26. What testimony is borne by the apostle Paul? 1 Thess. 4:16.

29. With what feelings did they return? Luke 24:52.
30. How will those who love the Lord always regard his coming? Rom. 5:2; Titus 2:13.
