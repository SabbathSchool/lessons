**Note**: In this lesson we have a notable example of the working of faith. Similar ones may be found in Matt. 9:2-8; 15:21-28; Luke 8:43-48; 18:35-43. Note the statement concerning these cases, that it was faith that healed them. In each case it was utterly impossible for the afflicted one to do anything for his own recovery. The only way they could even show their good will to be better was to submit to the power that could make them better. The same faith that restored these afflicted ones to health will make men righteous; and nothing else will. What the Lord requires of us is to walk humbly with God. Micah 6:8. But we are "without strength" (Rom. 5:8) and cannot walk. So God in his mercy lifts us up out of the pit, and sets our feet upon the Rock, and establishes our goings. Ps. 40:1-3. He makes us to walk in the way of his commandments; and the righteous acts done by faith are as real as were the steps taken by the man in the temple.
