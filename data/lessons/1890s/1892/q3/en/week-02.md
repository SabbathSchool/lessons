# Lesson 2 - July 9, 1892
## The Descent of the Holy Spirit
### Acts 2:1-21 (Memory Verses, 1-4)

**Golden Text**: "When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth." John 16:13.

1. To what place did the disciples return after the ascension of Christ? Acts 1:12, 13.
2. What command had Jesus given them? Verse 4.
3. How many of them were gathered together? Verse 15.
4. At what time was the promise fulfilled? Acts 2:1.
5. How long had they been praying together?

**Note**: Pentecost was the fiftieth day from the day that Jesus lay in the grave. As he was seen after his resurrection for forty days, the disciples must have been praying together about ten days.

6. In what way did the Spirit come? Verses 2, 3.

**Note**: Note that the text does not say that there came a wind from heaven, but that there came a sound as of a rushing, mighty wind. Notice also that it is not stated that fire sat upon the disciples. There was no fire, but the appearance of fire,â€”cloven tongues, "like as of fire." Since it was only like fire, it could not have been fire. This, therefore, has no connection with the baptism of fire spoken of by John the Baptist. Matt. 3:11.

7. What special gift did it impart? Verse 4.
8. What purpose do tongues serve? 1 Cor. 14:22.
9. Who were in Jerusalem at that time? Acts 2:5, 9-11.
10. How were the multitudes affected when the sound drew them to the place where the disciples were, and they heard the uneducated disciples speaking in every language? Verses 6-8.
11. What did each man hear in his own tongue? Verse 11.
12. What question did they ask? Verse 12.
13. What did the undevout ones say? Verse 13.
14. With what simple statement did Peter repel the mocking charge? Verses 14, 15; compare 1 Thess. 5:7.
15. Of what prophecy did he say that this wonderful manifestation was a fulfillment? Acts 2:16.
16. Give the substance of the prophecy. Verses 17-21.
17. For what purpose are the gifts of the Spirit bestowed? Eph. 4:11-13; 1 Cor. 12:7.
18. How long is the gospel to be preached? Matt. 24:14.
19. Will it meet with greater opposition, or less, as the end approaches? 2 Thess. 2:9, 10; 2 Tim. 3:13.
20. Then since the Spirit was needed in such power for the success of the gospel eighteen hundred years ago, how must it be now?
21. When Jesus promised the Spirit, how long did he say it should remain in the church? John 14:16.

**Note**: Jesus told the disciples that they should receive power after the Holy Ghost came upon them, and that by this power they should be witnesses for him unto the uttermost parts of the earth. The commission to preach the gospel to every creature has not yet expired, for the gospel is to be preached as a witness until the end comes. Matt. 24:14. Therefore the Spirit of power, with its gifts, must remain until the end. In every age wherever the gospel has gone with power, some of the gifts of the Spirit have been manifested. This must of necessity be more marked as the end approaches. Satan will work "with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish." 2 Thess. 2:9, 10. But he will not have the field all to himself; for God, by his Spirit, will work with all power and signs and wonders of truth in them that believe. On the day of Pentecost only one gift of the Spirit was manifested; consequently that did not exhaust Joel's prophecy. Others have been exhibited at different times since, and as the end draws near all the gifts will be manifested at once. All the believers will not have all the gifts, but everyone may have at least the gift of helping or ministering.

22. How many members of the church of Christ are to receive the Spirit? 1 Cor. 12:7-13.
23. Will all receive the same gifts? Verses 11, 28-30.
24. Which one of these last-mentioned gifts may everyone possess? See note under question 22.
