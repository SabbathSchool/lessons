# Lesson 6 - August 6, 1892
## The Apostles' Confidence in God
### Acts 4:19-33 (Memory Verses, 29-31)

**Golden Text**: "They spake the word of God with boldness." Acts 4:31.

1. What bold reply did Peter and John make to the command of the council that they should not teach any more in the name of Jesus? Acts 4:19-21.
2. When they were let go, what did they do? Verse 23.
3. When the brethren heard their story, what did they do? Verse 24.
4. In putting their trust in God, what power to help did they recognize him as having? Ib.
5. In what does the Psalmist say our help is? Ps. 124:8.
6. In the last announcement of the gospel to what is our attention especially directed? Rev. 14:6, 7.

**Note**: The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Rom. 1:16. The power of God is the power to create. Verse 20. The men who know the most of the gospel are the men who know most of the power of God. The men who preach the gospel with the most power are those who have felt in themselves the creative power of God, making them new creatures. Consequently, they trust that power to carry on the work, and to deliver and protect them from the rage of the enemy. So the disciples put their trust in the God who can create. The Sabbath is the memorial of God's creative and sanctifying power. Ex. 20:8-11; Eze. 20:12. Therefore those who are carrying the gospel, with that which is the badge of its power, ought most of all men on earth to trust the Lord. He who puts his trust in man, instead of God, has but a poor knowledge of what the Sabbath is.

7. From what psalm of David did the disciples quote? Acts 4:25, 26; Ps. 2:1, 2.
8. Were these David's words, or the Lord's? Acts 4:24, 25.
9. How had they been fulfilled? Verses 27, 28.
10. What did the disciples ask, in view of the threatenings of the Jews? Verses 29, 30.
11. What assurance did they receive that their prayer was answered? Verse 31.
12. Did they abate any of their activity and boldness in declaring the truth?

**Note**: The disciples had no thought of working any the less because they were threatened. They were in the Lord's hands, and upon him rested the responsibility of caring for them. But they would not even trust themselves not to be afraid; so they committed themselves to God, that he who made the earth might by the same power keep them from being moved by fear.

13. What characterized the believers? Verse 32, first part.
14. What exhortation is given in the name of the Lord Jesus? 1 Cor. 1:10.
15. How only can this be? Phil. 2:5.
16. What was the mind of Christ? Phil. 2:6, 7. Read Revised Version.
17. How was his grace shown? 2 Cor. 8:9.
18. How did the disciples manifest the same unselfish spirit? Acts 4:32, last part.
19. When the believers were in this condition, what characterized the preaching? Verse 33.

**Note**: "And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all." It is worth while to note that this was when the multitude of believers were of one heart and of one soul, and no one called anything that he had his own, but held it ready to bestow where there was need. In short, there was perfect unselfishness, and only the Spirit of Christ ruled.
