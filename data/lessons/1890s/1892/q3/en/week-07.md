## Ananias and Sapphira
### Acts 5:1-14 (Memory Verses, 9-11)

**Golden Text**: "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Gal. 6:7.

1. How did the early disciples regard their possessions? Acts 4:32.

7. Was Ananias obliged to sell his land, or to bring the money to the apostles? Verse 4.
8. What motive must have actuated him?

**Note**: While the other disciples were honestly giving their means to help the cause and the poor, Ananias and Sapphira were wholly selfish. They wanted to be thought poor, so as to be supported from the treasury, and at the same time they secretly kept a good sum to use as they pleased. They had a right to keep it all if they wished. There was no compulsion. They were not punished for keeping back the money, but for hypocrisy,â€”for lying to God. The Holy Ghost, to whom they lied, exposed them.

15. Who were added to the church? Verse 14.

17. How is it, then, that Christ's church is to be kept free from those who would bring a reproach upon it? Isa. 5:7, first part; 27:2, 3.
18. Why is it that we do not see it so kept now?

**Note**: When Christ is followed as the only leader, and he is allowed to control the church by his own word, he will keep it clear of hypocrites. There is a great temptation, when the church is in the condition that the early church was, for designing men to seek to come into it for their own pecuniary advantage. Sometimes this is used as an argument against doing the same now that the early church did. But see how Christ protected his church then, and by the prompt judgment upon the hypocrites caused others to fear to join. Yet believers were added every day.
