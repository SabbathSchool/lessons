# Lesson 2 - April 9, 1892

## The King in Zion

### Memory Verses: Psalm 2:10-12

**Golden Text**: "Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him." Psalm 2:12

**Note**—The psalm under consideration is divided into four parts, as follows: 1. A prediction of the efforts of the rulers of the world against Christ when he was manifested as the Anointed of God, and, hence, against God, who sent him, and the result of their efforts. 2. The address of the Father to the nations. 3. The address of the Son. 4. An appeal of love and warning to the people.

### The Prediction

1. What is said of the nations at the first advent of Christ? Ps. 2:1.

2. What did they do against Christ? Verses 2, 3.

   **Note**—"Messiah," in Hebrew, and "Christ," in Greek, mean "anointed." See John 1:41, margin. The Anointed of Jehovah is Christ the Lord. That anointing took place when he was manifested to the world as the Messiah. It was effected at his baptism, when the Holy Spirit, like a dove, rested upon him. Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38.

3. What would their counsel against God prove to be? Ps. 2:1, last clause.

4. What did their counsel really result in? Acts 4:25-28; Rev. 12:10.

5. Of what great truth is this a confirmation? 2 Cor. 13:8.

### The Address of the Father

6. How did God regard their rage? Ps. 2:4.

7. Because of their thus rejecting God what will he do? Verse 5.

8. When and by whom will this wrath finally be executed? 2 Thess. 1:7-9.

9. What has God done for that Son whom his people thought to destroy? Ps. 2:6.

10. Where is this hill of Zion? Heb. 12:22.

11. What position does Christ occupy there? Heb. 8:1; Zech. 6:13.

### The Address of the Son

12. What does Christ say he will declare? Ps. 2:7, first part.

13. What is this decree of God? Verse 7, last part.

14. To what time does this refer? Acts 13:33; Heb. 5:5.

15. What did the resurrection show Jesus to be? Rom. 1:3, 4.

16. What assurance does God give him? Ps. 2:8.

17. What promise and oath of God will then be fulfilled? Gen. 22:16-18.

18. At what time will this be fulfilled? 1 Cor. 15:24-28.

    **Note**—That the student may not be misled, we give the following paraphrase of 1 Cor. 15:24-28: "Then cometh the end [of Christ's reign on his Father's throne as priest, Zech. 6:12, 13; Rev. 3:21], when he [the Son] shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he [the Father] shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he [the Son] must reign [as priest], till he [the Father] hath put all enemies under his [the Son's] feet [as the Father promised in Ps. 110:1]. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he [the Father] hath [in purpose, Rom. 4:17, last part] put all things under his [the Son's] feet. But when he [the Father] saith all things are put under him [the Son], it is manifest that he [the Father] is excepted, that did put all things under him [the Son]. And when all things shall be subdued unto him [the Son], then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him [the Father] that put all things under him [the Son], that God may be all in all." Then Christ takes his own throne. Matt. 25:31; Rev. 3:21.

19. What will he do to those nations who at that time know him not? Ps. 2:9; Matt. 13:39-42.

### The Loving Appeal

20. Before that great day of wrath comes, what appeal does God in mercy make through the gospel? Ps. 2:10, 11.

21. Instead of meditating evil against the Son, what does he entreat them to do? Verse 12.

    **Note**—The word translated "kiss" is evidently used in the sense of receiving, embracing, accepting. Some ancient authorities render, "Lay hold of (or receive) instruction," others, "Worship in purity." See margin of Revised Version.

22. In what time alone have we assurance? 2 Cor. 6:2; Heb. 3:13.

23. What gracious assurance does God give to all? John 6:37; golden text.
