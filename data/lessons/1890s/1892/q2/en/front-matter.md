## THE SABBATH-SCHOOL WORKER

A sixteen-page monthly journal, devoted to the interests of the Sabbath school work, published by

THE INTERNATIONAL SABBATH SCHOOL ASSOCIATION, OAKLAND, CAL

In addition to general articles upon the various phases of the Sabbath school work, the following departments will be kept up:—

**SPECIAL MENTION**—This department of the WORKER is conducted by the Executive Committee of the International Association, and will contain information concerning the progress of the work in different parts of the field, as well as valuable suggestions in regard to the best methods to be employed in carrying it on.

**TALKS WITH CORRESPONDENTS**—Under this heading will appear extracts from letters of general interest, answers to questions, and suggestions in regard to the manner of organizing and conducting a Sabbath school, etc. It is hoped that those in perplexity in regard to any branch of the work will communicate with the editors of the WORKER. All such letters will be answered in this department of the WORKER, or privately as may be thought best.

**HINTS ON TEACHING**—As the heading would indicate, this department will contain special help for teachers. Notes which are not found in pamphlets or lesson papers will be prepared for the senior, intermediate, and primary divisions. From these, teachers may obtain valuable suggestions and illustrations, which will assist them in their work.

**THE MISSION FIELD**—This department will be one of special interest to all. It will contain articles on different missions and missionary enterprises, giving special attention to those to which our Sabbath school contributions have been or are soon to be devoted.

In addition to the above the tabulated quarterly reports from all our Sabbath schools will appear each quarter.
