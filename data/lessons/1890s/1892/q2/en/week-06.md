## Delight in God's House

### Memory Verses: Psalm 84:9-12

**Golden Text**: "Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house." Psalm 84:4

**Introduction**—This psalm is divided into three parts, of four verses each, the first four verses referring to God's house, the second to the source of strength, the third the blessings of God's presence.

1. How did the Psalmist regard the tabernacle of the Lord? Ps. 84:1.

   **Note**—The term "tabernacle" means "dwelling place of God," and generally applies to the sanctuary in the wilderness, or the temple at Jerusalem, where the Presence of God dwelt in the earthly tabernacle. Inspiration uses it as a type of the spiritual house of God.

2. How great was his longing for the house of God? Verse 2.

3. Why did he long for the courts of God? Last part of verse 2.

4. By what example does he illustrate the tender love of God? Verse 3.

   **Note**—Boothroyd gives an altogether different rendering of this verse, which he contends the original justifies, and which considerably changes the meaning: "Yea, as the sparrow findeth a house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young, so I seek thine altars, Jehovah, God of hosts, my King and my God." The thought is that just as the sparrow and swallow make it their first business, when the season comes, to build them a nest, a home, so the child of God seeks the altars of God, where he may dwell in the presence of his King. The sense is clearer than is expressed in the common version. If the idea expressed in our text is correct, it would illustrate the peace and safety of the house of God, even to the birds, whose instinct led them there. If instinct, how much more faith.

5. What does the Psalmist say of those who dwell in God's house? Verse 4.

   **Note**—The Psalmist could not have had reference to living in the literal tabernacle or temple, for this fact of itself did not change the character. For the iniquity committed by those connected with the literal temple see Ezekiel 8, and the case of Eli and sons, 1 Samuel 2 to 4. The literal temple of God would be too narrow a meaning. The spiritual house of God, the church, the temple, built by Christ is evidently meant. Zech. 6:13. The word "Selah" occurs some seventy-four times in the Bible. The rabbins held it to mean "forever," but it is generally considered as indicating some change in the music.

6. In what house of God may we abide and be blessed? Eph. 2:19-22; Heb. 3:6.

7. How should we regard the assembling together of the people of God? Heb. 10:25; John 4:24.

8. What alone makes the meeting-place of God's people precious? Matt. 18:20.

9. What does the Psalmist say of those who are strong in the Lord? Ps. 84:5.

   **Note**—Boothroyd renders the last part of the verse, "Confidence reigns in the heart." The Revised Version, "In whose heart are the highways of Zion."

10. What does even the desolate land of weeping (Baca, a place of weeping), become to them? Verse 6.

    **Note**—"Though they pass through the desolate valley, yet shall they drink from a fountain; yea, the [early, R. V.] rain shall cover it with blessings."—Boothroyd. See Jer. 17:8.

11. What is this fountain, or well, from which they drink? John 4:13, 14.

12. What marks the course of those who thus trust God? Ps. 84:7.

13. By what power do they make this progress? Rom. 1:16, 17.

14. What petition does the Psalmist make for such attainments? Ps. 84:8.

    **Note**—His petition is to the Ever-living One, the God of Hosts, who is abundantly able to help, the covenant God, who cannot break his promise.

15. By what term does he show that he trusts in God? Verse 9, first clause.

16. Whom does he present before God in his behalf? Same verse, last clause. God's Anointed is the Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ. See John 1:41, margin.

17. What comparison does he make between God's house, the time spent there, and those places and times when God's presence is not manifested? Verse 10.

18. What does he say that God is to his people? Verse 11, first part.

    **Note**—The sun gives light, the shield protects. Such is God to his people. He is a light in darkness, he protects in danger. His light leads in duty; his strength or shield defends in the conflict.

19. What will he give to his people? Verse 11, second clause.

20. Into what will God's grace ripen in the hearts of those who receive it? Rom. 5:1, 2; Eph. 1:6, 18.

21. How are the gifts of God summed up to us? Ps. 84:11, last clause. See Rom. 8:28; 1 Cor. 3:21-23.

22. What does the Psalmist conclude in view of God's goodness and power? Ps. 84:12.
