# Lesson 9 - May 28, 1892

## Nebuchadnezzar's Dream

### Memory Verse: Daniel 2:44

**Golden Text**: "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do." Hebrews 4:13

1. By what means did God trouble the mind of Nebuchadnezzar when he was established in his kingdom? Dan. 2:1.

2. What success did he have in learning by his wise men the dream and its interpretation? Verses 10-12.

3. When the news came to Daniel, what did he do? Verses 14-16.

4. Of whom did Daniel seek counsel? and what was the result? Verses 17-19; 1:17, last clause.

5. To whom did Daniel give all the glory? Dan. 2:20-23.

6. For what purpose was the dream given? Verses 28-30.

7. Relate the dream. Verses 31-35.

8. What did Daniel interpret the head of gold to mean? Verses 36-38.

   **Note**—This is an unequivocal starting-point. Nebuchadnezzar, not as a single king, but as representing the Babylonian dynasty, was the "head of gold." This is shown by another "kingdom," not king, following. The word "king" is used as representing kingdom all through the book of Daniel.

9. What was represented by the breast and arms of silver? Verse 39, first part; 5:30, 31; 8:20.

10. What is represented by the belly and thighs of brass? Dan. 2:39, last part; 8:21.

11. What did he say of the fourth kingdom? Dan. 2:40; see 7:7.

12. Of what kingdom have we next a record in the word of God? Luke 2:1. Caesar was an emperor of Rome.

13. What prediction of this power did God give nearly a thousand years before Daniel's time? Deut. 28:49, 50.

14. What was indicated by the mixture of iron and clay? Dan. 2:41, first part.

    **Note**—It is well to mark that the division of the empire is not indicated by the toes, as stated by some commentators, but by the mixture of iron and clay. As the feet and toes were part of clay and part of iron, so the kingdom was to be divided.

15. What would be the characteristics of the kingdom? Verses 41, 42.

    **Note**—Great strength and great weakness. Strong to resist any other power, as represented by the iron; so weak as never to become united, because of the intermingling of the clay. The iron well represents imperialism, that which seeks to dominate all, the strongest government among men, while clay represents the republican element, weak in cohesive power, tending always to division. These characteristics have been most prominent in European powers.

16. What effort would these divisions make to unite or amalgamate? Verse 43.

    **Note**—This is generally understood to refer to intermarriages among royal families, in order to unite governments; but all efforts of man are futile. One line of God's word is mightier than all the powers of earth.

17. What did the prophet declare would occur in the last days of this divided kingdom, as represented by the "stone cut out without hands"? Verse 44.

18. How will that kingdom be set up? and how long will it endure? Verse 44; Ps. 2:8, 9; Luke 1:32, 33.

19. What did the prophet of God say of the dream and its interpretation? Dan. 2:45.

20. What did Daniel's revelation bring him and his companions? Verses 46, 48, 49.

21. But to whom, as the Revealer of secrets, did the great monarch give the glory after all? Verse 47.

22. What great truths may we learn from this lesson? Golden text; Isa. 46:9, 10; Rom. 15:4.
