# Lesson 4 - April 23, 1892

## The Lord My Shepherd

### Memory Verses: Psalm 23:1-6

**Golden Text**: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." Psalm 23:1

1. Who does David say is his shepherd? Verse 1, first part. The word "Lord" comes from "Jehovah."

2. Through whom was Jehovah especially manifested in such a tender relation? John 10:11, first clause; Heb. 13:20.

   **Note**—It has been well remarked that if we would appreciate the infinite trust and tenderness expressed in this psalm, we must take into consideration the life of the Syrian shepherd. He was constantly with his sheep, nearly always alone. However large his flock, he knew every sheep by name, and every sheep knew him. In the cool, frosty nights, in the fierce heat of the noonday sun, in the storm and tempest, in the rocky, rugged way as well as in the green pastures, he was identified with his flock, leading them to pastures of plenty, or imperiling his life for their safety. All this was known to David, to Moses, to Jacob, and others. 1 Sam. 17:34-36; Ex. 3:1; Gen. 31:38-40.

3. What assurance may we draw from the fact that the Lord is our Shepherd? Ps. 23:1, last clause.

4. What basis have we for such assurance? Col. 1:19; 2:9.

5. What does Jesus say of the relation between him and his people? John 10:14, 15.

   **Note**—The Revised Version reads thus: "I am the Good Shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father." They are all united by the same bond of union, namely, the "life that is in God."

6. How great is the love which Christ bears for his sheep? John 10:11, last clause.

7. Is such love manifested only toward the faithful? Isa. 53:5, 6.

8. What contrast does he draw between the true and false shepherds? John 10:11-13.

9. How do his sheep regard his voice? Verses 2-4.

10. How do the sheep of the Lord regard the voice of strangers? Verse 5.

11. What blessing does he bestow upon them? Ps. 23:2.

    **Note**—The life of the Christian is not all conflict. God gives the precious privilege now and then of quiet, refreshful resting-places, where the soul may feed on the bread of life, and rest while it partakes; where the longing heart may wander beside "the waters of rest," the waters which bring rest, the communion of the Spirit of God. Thus it is that we are prepared for the conflict, just as such quiet and abundant feeding restores the lean and fainting sheep, and fits them for enduring long and tiresome journeys.

12. What is the effect of these restful blessings of God? Ps. 23:3, first part.

13. How is the soul kept in this condition? Verse 3.

14. For whose sake does God grant all these blessings to his people? Same verse.

    **Note**—This is a thought which should be ever kept before us. God grants us no blessings because of our worth to him. It is wholly by his grace, wholly for his name's sake. It is often pity for the lost sheep which moves the true shepherd to go forth, frequently periling his life for its rescue; it was unmerited pity and boundless love alone which moved the heart of the Great Shepherd to give his life for the sheep.

15. How fully may we expect the Shepherd's presence in the journey of life? Verse 4, first part. The expression, "valley of the shadow of death" denotes the profoundest darkness, but Christ will be with us, even in the greatest trial.

16. What comfort has the Christian in this darkness? Verse 4; Isa. 41:10.

    **Note**—"Rod" is used to denote a kingly scepter, a symbol of power, an instrument of correction and guidance. It would fitly symbolize God's law, which, like the shepherd's crook, brings the straying back to the path of safety. See our last lesson. "Staff" denotes a stay or support, a means of defense, and would fittingly represent the gospel, the aggregation of all God's promises, the only hope and stay of the people of God. In Zech. 11:7 the shepherd had two staves; the name of one was "Beauty" (margin, "Graciousness"); the name of the other was "Bands" (margin, "Binders" or "Union"). See Revised Version. These would fittingly represent in the Great Shepherd the gospel and law, the fullness of God's word, but, unlike the earthly shepherd's staves, they can never be broken. "Comfort" does not simply mean to console, but to strengthen and establish. And that soul who trusts in the gospel of Christ, whose feet are set in the way of his commandments, is indeed comforted and established.

17. What triumph does God give his servant in the midst of his enemies? Ps. 23:5; Rom. 8:35, 37.

18. What is always the result of one's cup running over with God's blessings? Ps. 40:3.

19. From the Psalmist's confidence in God, what does he conclude? Ps. 23:6.

20. In what house of God did the Psalmist expect to dwell? Eph. 2:19-22.
