    **Note**—First of all, Daniel was God's servant, he was not, therefore, the servant of men. 1 Cor. 7:23. He knew that right was of God and right would win. He knew that to deny his faith in face of the law was to deny God, was to show to his enemies that he did not believe that God would help him in time of trouble. Note that he made no display of his faith or lack of faith; he did not defy the unjust law nor show that he despised it; neither did he cringe or compromise; he simply did as he had always done. His purpose to do God's will was not affected in the least by the law. He was living the heavenly life.

    "Count me o'er earth's chosen heroes,—they were souls that stood alone  
    While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone,  
    Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline  
    To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,  
    By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design."
    —Lowell.

15. By what means and power are the people of God kept from the superabounding evils of the last days? 1 Peter 1:5.

16. How did the lions treat the accusers of Daniel? Dan. 6:24.

17. How did this experience result for Daniel? Verse 28.

18. How did it result for the cause of God? Verses 25-27.

    **Note**—There is no reason to suppose that Daniel expected great results to flow from his simple faith in God apart from his own connection with God. But such are the acts which God uses to advance his kingdom. Most of his people had departed from him and were in captivity. A new empire ruled the world. The world must be enlightened even if God's people would not do it. God so overruled here, as in the case of Daniel's companions, that the head of the government issued a decree which promulgated the name and somewhat of the character of the true God to the entire empire. That very proclamation must have given opportunity to many honest hearts to find the true God. We will never realize the fruits of Daniel's faith till we see the redeemed souls in the kingdom of Christ. God makes the wrath of man to praise him.
