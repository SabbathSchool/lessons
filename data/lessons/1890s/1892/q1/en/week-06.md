13. Why would men run after Christ? Isa. 55:5. Because God had glorified him in his sufferings for the world (John 3:31), in his resurrection from the dead (Eph. 1:19, 20), in the effectual power of his priesthood (Heb. 5:5); he is glorified in his people (1 Peter 4:14), and glorified with his people when he comes again (Rom. 8:17, 18).

*NOTE* - There could be no more beautiful figure of the power of God's gracious mercy upon the heart of the sinner than is contained in the two verses above. Just as the snow and rain, to the human eye of little worth, falling upon the dry and barren soil, causes to spring forth the grass and herb, so God's grace and mercy will soften the hard, barren heart of the sinner and make it fruitful. This is the promise, it will never return void to the heart of faith.

20. What does he say of the way, the joy, and triumph of him who accepts of this mercy? Verses 12, 13; Isa. 61:10, 11; 54:13-15.
