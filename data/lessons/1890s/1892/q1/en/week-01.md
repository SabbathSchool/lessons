*NOTE* - The prophet presents the character of Jesus as it would be manifest in his entire work: (1) As man's Example; (2) as the wise Teacher; the Wisdom of God; (3) as Judge; (4) as King. The Spirit of God rested upon him at the time of his baptism (John 1:33); the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might and knowledge, was manifested repeatedly in his marvelous teaching, in his knowledge of men's hearts, in his replies to his adversaries, in his speaking the dead to life, and the stormy sea to a calm (see Luke 4:22; Matt. 13:54; 7:28, 29; Luke 20:26, 40; John 11:43, 44; Mark 4:39); and his fear of the Lord was shown in that he, as our Example, kept his Father's commandments (John 5:30; 12:49, 50; 15:10). Between his first and second advent Christ is a kingly priest upon his Father's throne. Heb. 8:1. During this time he is developing out from among all nations a people for his kingdom. Isa. 11:10 applies to this time.
