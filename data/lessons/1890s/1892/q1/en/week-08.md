1. Who was Jehoiakim and when and how did he come to the throne of Judah? See note.

*NOTE* - Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, his name by birth, was the oldest son of Josiah, king of Judah, who died B.C. 610. The people made Josiah's second son king, which displeased the king of Egypt, under whose yoke they were. He deposed Jehoahaz, after a reign of only three months, and put Eliakim in his place, changing his name to Jehoiakim. This was probably in 609 B.C., the same year of Josiah's death. See 2 Kings 23:29-36.

2. What was his character? 2 Kings 23:37.

3. Who prophesied against his wickedness? and what did the king do unto him? Jer. 26:20-23.

4. What other prophet faithfully warned Jehoiakim against his coming doom, his overthrow by Nebuchadnezzar? Ans.—Jeremiah. He exhorted him to turn from his iniquity, that the Lord might repent him of the evil.
