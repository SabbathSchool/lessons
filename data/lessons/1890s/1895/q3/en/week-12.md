### NOTES

1. THAT is, there is no record of his genealogy. He had no successor or predecessor in the priesthood; and Christ is a priest after the order of Melchizedek, because He did not belong to a priestly line, with a predecessor and successor in the same line.

2. THE force of this scripture will be seen and realized more fully when we remember that Christ's teaching during His public ministry was designed especially for what is generally called the Christian dispensation. This is conclusively shown by the language used in the great commission. Christ gives explicit instruction to the apostles to teach "all things whatsoever I have commanded you." See Matt. 28:19, 20.

3. **Ought.**—"Was or were under obligations to pay; owed. To be bound in duty or moral obligations."— Webster. While it is proper to instruct the people from the word of God in the duty of paying tithes, each individual should be left free to decide for himself how much he will pay. No one should try to be conscience for another in the matter.

4. To live on the things of the temple was to live on the things brought into the Lord's storehouse. This consisted principally of the tithe. See Mal. 3:10; Num. 18:20-24; 2 Chron. 31:4-12.

5. "EVEN so" means in like manner. As the priests and Levites were supported by the tithes brought into the storehouse by those who recognized and responded to God's claim upon them, "even so" God's ministers now are supported by the tithes brought into the Lord's treasury by those who believe and obey the gospel.

6. THE Lord has made ample provision for the support of those who labor in His vineyard. He has reserved the tithe for this purpose; it is the Lord's. He uses His own means to recompense His laborers.
