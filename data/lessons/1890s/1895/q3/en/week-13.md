### NOTES

1. As the Lord created us, and has given us life and breath and all things (Acts 17:24-28), we belong to Him, and all we have belongs to Him. The One who freely gives us everything certainly has a right to reserve to Himself a portion of our time and a portion of our means as a test of our love and worship. Such a claim is manifestly just.

2. As the tithe is the Lord's, and rightfully belongs to Him, we have no right to use it for ourselves, or appropriate it in any way; if we do, we are guilty of robbing God. Our duty is simply to place it in the treasury of the Lord, that it may be used to pay His servants.

3. MALACHI 3 so clearly applies to the Christian dispensation that no argument is necessary to prove it. A careful reading of the chapter, in connection with chapter 4, is sufficient to convince the candid seeker after truth that it belongs to the present dispensation, and especially to the last days.

4. WHEN we seek our own ease and comfort, and do not respond to God's claims upon us, and yet know what they are, God's curse will surely fall upon us.

5. THIS language necessarily implies the precious promise that if we bring all the tithes into the storehouse, and thus prove Him, as He asks us to do, He will pour us out a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it. Those who prove or test the Lord always find him true to His promise. We are not to conclude, however, that the Lord will necessarily shower temporal blessings upon us because we are faithful in paying tithes. He will give us just such blessings as He sees will be for our best good and for His glory.
