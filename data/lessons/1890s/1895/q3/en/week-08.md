### NOTES

1. A SEAL used in connection with a legal document is a device by which a document is so stamped as to show it to be authentic or genuine. By reference to Esther 8:8; 1 Kings 21:8, it will be seen that a law must be sealed to be authentic. In the matter of a law the seal must show the name of the ruler who gave the law, the position he occupies, the authority he exercises, the extent of his dominion—in brief, the name, the authority, the territory. If any of these are lacking, the law would not be valid or the document authoritative. The seal of God must be connected with His law, the only document He ever wrote, and must contain these three characteristics. When placed upon God's servants, it is His mark, or seal, stamps them as His, and His alone.

2. THE work of sealing predicted in Isa. 8:16 is a work that pertains to the Christian dispensation (verse 14), and undoubtedly refers to Christ. See references from verses 15, 17, 18 to the New Testament, where this scripture is applied to Christ and His work and His disciples. Verses 19-22 refer to the last great deception of Spiritualism and the blackness of darkness which will come upon the wicked. The plans, schemes, confederacies, and associations of man to put off the evil day, so manifest at the present time, are referred to in verses 9-12. The sure refuge is pointed out in verse 13, the Lord of hosts in the heart. Compare with 1 Peter 3:15. And finally verse 17 shows that the sealing work is carried on when Christ's disciples are waiting for His coming in glory. 1 Thess. 1:10; Isa. 25:9. Then those who bear His seal will say, "Yea, in the way of Thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for Thee; to Thy name and to Thy memorial [the Sabbath] is the desire of our soul." Isa. 26:8, Revised Version. Then will the testimony, the witness, the attestation of God's law, be restored.

3. THE prophecy of Rev. 7:1-4 also refers to the last days. It is a work which takes place under the sixth seal before God's judgments are manifest. It comes in between verses 13 and 14 of Revelation 6. They are those who are redeemed from the earth when the Lord comes. Rev. 14:1-5. They are called Israel in the primary meaning of the term, those who have prevailing faith with God. See Gen. 32:24-28. All the redeemed host of God will be called Israel. They will enter the glorious city of the redeemed through one of its twelve gates, which are named after one of the twelve tribes. Rev. 21:12. They have upon them the name of Jerusalem, their mother. Rev. 3:12. This company, the redeemed as a whole, are not among the numbered tribes of earth, but all are numbered in the records on high, children of God. They are those who have had sincere repentance, and who weep over sin (Eze. 9:4), who are Christ's disciples indeed (Isa. 8:16; John 8:31, 32). They are the true Israel of God by faith. Rom. 2:28, 29; Eph. 2:12, 13, 19, 20.

4. IT is the meek and humble that God will teach and guide; it is the submissive He will mould and purify and refine through trial by His word. The dross will be burned away till the pure metal reflects His image. The stubborn clay will be beaten and moulded and softened, if possible, till God can stamp it with his own seal. The stamping, the sealing, is the finishing part of the work. The soul is tried, and is not found wanting. The law is written in the heart, and the seal of that law, the fourth commandment, which reveals to us the fullness of Christ's power and character as the only living and true God, which reveals to us in that character that "name above every name," is the last work of the Spirit of God prior to the coming of Christ. That seal will be placed upon no one who loves sin. It will be impressed upon everyone who hates sin and loves Christ, or chooses Christ above all things else.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS
The Spirit of God—what is its work in the heart of the believer? What is its attitude toward God's law? Does the Spirit lead us contrary to the law? What is that spirit which would lead us contrary to God's law? Is Rev. 7:1-3 now being fulfilled? What is the character of those sealed? Rev. 14:1-5. Over whom do they obtain victory, and through whom? Rev. 15:2.
