### NOTES

1. In the plan of God the typical services and offerings of the former dispensation were to extend to the death of Christ, which took place at the close of His earthly life. He placed before us in His spotless example "the way, the truth, and the life;" but He could not minister His blood before it was shed, and He could not officiate as priest at that time, because He was not of the tribe of Levi. Heb. 7:12-14.

2. The typical service which was performed in the worldly sanctuary was a shadow of a service which was still future. Type reaches antitype, but cannot exist at the same time. The shadow is past when the substance is reached. They cannot occupy the same space; hence Christ's ministration in the heavenly temple could not begin while the earthly sanctuary and its typical services was being carried forward under the divine sanction. It is also evident that the Lamb of God must first be slain before His precious blood could be ministered in our behalf. This did not prevent those who lived before Christ died from being benefited by His sacrifice, because by faith they grasped the saving truth that Christ was a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13:8.

3. From the Scriptures we learn that God will finally dwell with men indeed, not as in the days of ancient Israel, by a symbol — the shekinah — in a temple made with hands, having in it furniture which reminds of sin, and a service performed for its removal; but He will actually dwell with men by His personal presence, in the New Jerusalem, "our Father's house," with many mansions, all prepared for the eternal home of the redeemed by the One who will soon come again to receive us to Himself. John 14:1-3.
