### NOTES

1. There is great comfort and encouragement in the lesson taught in this verse; and in Ex. 31:1-6, for those who are called to do the work of God. He gives them the wisdom and skill which they need to do the work acceptably. "The meek will He guide in judgment; and the meek will He teach His way." Ps. 25:9. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." James 1:5.

2. "Over the ephod was the breastplate, the most sacred of the priestly vestments. This was of the same material as the ephod. It was in the form of a square, measuring a span, and was suspended from the shoulders by a cord of blue, from golden rings. The border was formed of a variety of precious stones, the same that formed the twelve foundations of the city of God. Within the border were twelve stones, set in gold, arranged in rows of four, and, like those on the shoulder-pieces, engraved with the names of the tribes. The Lord's direction was, 'Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually.' So Christ, the great High Priest, pleading His blood before the Father in the sinner's behalf, bears upon His heart the name of every repentant, believing soul. Says the Psalmist, 'I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me.'

"At the right and left of the breastplate were two large stones of great brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and Thummim. By them the will of God was made known through the high priest. When questions were brought for decision before the Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone at the right was a token of the divine consent or approval, while a cloud shadowing the stone at the left was an evidence of denial or disapprobation." — Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 351.
