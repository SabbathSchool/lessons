### NOTES

1. There has been much speculation concerning Melchisedec, especially as to who He was. This has been wholly unnecessary. The sacred record is clear and explicit. It says that he was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. Some have contended that he was Shem. But this view contradicts the testimony of Scripture, for that says that he has no genealogy (Heb. 7:3), and Shem's genealogy is plainly stated (Gen. 5:32). If the genealogy of Melchisedec can be traced, or ascertained, then the truthfulness of the Scripture record would be disproved, for that declares that he has none, and, besides, Christ would not then be a priest after the order of Melchisedec. All should be satisfied to leave the matter where the Scriptures leave it, and not be wise above what is written.

2. The fact that Christ differed from the priests in the former dispensation in no way militates against the truth that their ministration as priests was an example of His. Christ was a priest after the order of Melchisedec, that is, He had no predecessor, and will have no successor. "He ever liveth to make intercession." Heb. 7:25.

3. Christ's sacrifice and ministration are so efficacious that with each it is "once for all." One sacrifice on Calvary was sufficient, and He ministers in each apartment of the heavenly sanctuary "once for all."
