### NOTES

1. "The daily ministration embraced the regular morning and evening burnt offering (Ex. 29:38-43), the burning of sweet incense on the golden altar of incense every morning when the high priest dressed the lamps, and every evening when he lighted them (Exodus 30), the additional work appointed for the Sabbaths of the Lord, and the annual sabbaths, new moons, and feasts (Numbers, chapters 28, 29), besides the particular work to be accomplished for individuals as they should present their offerings throughout the year." — The Sanctuary and Its Cleansing, p. 203.

2. "In the sin offerings presented during the year, a substitute had been accepted in the sinner's stead; but the blood of the victim had not made full atonement for the sin. It had only provided a means by which the sin was transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering of blood the sinner acknowledged the authority of the law, confessed the guilt of his transgression, and expressed his faith in Him who was to take away the sin of the world; but he was not entirely released from the condemnation of the law. On the day of atonement the high priest, having taken an offering for the congregation, went into the most holy place with the blood, and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, above the tables of the law. Thus the claims of the law, which demanded the life of the sinner, were satisfied. Then in his character of mediator the priest took the sins upon himself, and, leaving the sanctuary, he bore with him the burden of Israel's guilt. At the door of the tabernacle he laid his hands upon the head of the scapegoat, and confessed over him 'all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.' And as the goat bearing these sins was sent away, they were with him regarded as forever separated from the people." — Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 355, 356.

3. The seventh month, Jewish time, comes in the autumn of the year, because the sacred year, as reckoned by the Jews, began in the spring.

4. When Christ, the Lamb of God, died on Calvary, the earthly sanctuary and its service had fulfilled its purpose. Type had reached antitype, and "the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom." Matt. 27:50, 51. This miraculous token was to signify that the temple at Jerusalem was no longer to be considered as the center of acceptable worship to God, although the temple service was kept up by the Jewish people until the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans under Titus, in A.D. 70.
