### NOTES

1. Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), and he who transgresses the law is a sinner. But when a man not only sins himself but by his influence and power leads millions of others to sin, how fitting that he should be called "the man of sin"! So the Papacy, under the symbol of the little horn in Daniel 7, is said to have "eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things" (verse 8), and he thinks to change times and the law (verse 25), and hence the Lord appropriately calls him "the man of sin." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.

2. In view of the fact that the judgment is now in session, and that the law of God is the rule of judgment, it surely is the duty of those who have the light that shines from the sanctuary, to proclaim the great truth that "the hour of His judgment is come," and plead with the people to turn from all false worship and "keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus," that they may stand in the judgment and be accounted worthy of everlasting life. This is the message which is now due, and which must be given to the world, according to the prophecy. Rev. 14:6-12.

3. Man, in his fallen condition, is so blinded by sin that he cannot see the holiness and perfection of the divine law. Our eyes need to be anointed that we may see. Hence the Psalmist prays, "Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law." Ps. 119:18. The gospel reveals the law in all its perfection and beauty in the person of Jesus Christ. In Him all fullness dwells. Col. 2:9. Therefore in receiving Christ and beholding Him the righteousness of the law is revealed to us and fulfilled in us. Rom. 8:3, 4.

4. Babylon, from Babel, which signifies confusion, is a very appropriate symbol of the church of to-day with its multitudinous sects and jargon of conflicting creeds. The truth of God for these last days would have healed Babylon (Jer. 51:7-9), but she rejected the light from heaven, and teaches fables and false doctrines, to turn the people away from the truth and work of God. Thus she makes the nations drunken, and suffers a moral fall.

5. In her fallen condition, having separated herself from the Lord, her source of strength, she seeks the help of earthly powers, and unites with them in order to secure it. Thus she commits fornication and fills up the cup of her iniquity. Soon the plagues described in Rev. 18:8-24 will overtake Babylon, and hence it behooves God's people to come out of her, and not partake of her sins and receive of her plagues. Verse 4. The Babylon here brought to view evidently includes the mother and the daughters of this great family, viz., the Church of Rome and all those churches that unite with the world and reject the Lord by refusing to obey His word and by teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
