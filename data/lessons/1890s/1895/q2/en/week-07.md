### NOTES

1. It is the privilege of the children of God to have the same character that Daniel had, so that their enemies can find no accusation against them, except concerning the law of their God, or, in other words, in regard to their religious faith. Our course should be faultless before the world, then our influence will tell most powerfully in favor of the religion which we profess. If we do unto others as we would that others should do unto us, this will be the case. We will be kind, generous, forgiving, gentle, honest, and truthful.

2. Daniel was not ashamed of his religion, neither was he afraid to have it known that he prayed to God, even when he risked his life by continuing his devotions, as was his custom. Daniel was not defiant in his attitude toward the king. He only prayed as aforetime. If he had begun this manner of praying after the decree was issued, he would have shown a defiant spirit, which is never proper for the Christian to manifest. The people of God should be loyal to Him, whether human laws are liberal or oppressive, whether they are framed in the interests of liberty and equality, or of a religious despotism. And, however unjust and oppressive, human laws should be obeyed by the Christian unless they conflict with the law of God or our duty to Him. To this rule there is no exception.
