# APPLES OF GOLD LIBRARY

This is a little monthly publication, designed especially for use in personal correspondence. Each number contains from four to sixteen pages of a size convenient to go into a No. 6 envelope without folding. It is printed on thin paper, and one or two numbers can be put in with an ordinary letter without increasing the postage.

It is the object of the publishers to present in this Library the leading themes of the gospel in such a way as to arrest the attention and create a desire to read more, and thus lead souls to Christ and his salvation. They are to be used by the gospel workers in their daily correspondence. A package should be kept on hand, and when writing to a friend, inclose one or more copies, and thus "sow beside all waters."

The following numbers have already been issued:—

| No. 1. | Looking to Jesus | 1 cent |
|--------|-----------------|------:|
| No. 2. | The Christian's Privilege | |

Five copies for one year, postpaid, 50 cents; or 12 copies for $1.00. Single subscriptions are not desirable, for two reasons: (1) The numbers being so small they are liable to be lost in the mails. (2) If they are used in correspondence, as recommended, more than one copy would be necessary.
