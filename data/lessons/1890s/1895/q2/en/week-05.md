### NOTES

1. The counsel given the king by Daniel was clearly the counsel of God, for in another scripture the Lord gives the same counsel when He says, "Cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow." Isa. 1:16, 17. The same thought is also expressed in James 1:27. We are enabled to break off our sins by securing the righteousness of God by faith. Rom. 3:21, 22, 25.

2. It is generally agreed among Bible scholars that a "time" in the book of Daniel and in the Revelation means a year. Josephus says that the seven "times" were seven years, and it will be noticed that the same expression, "seven times," is used by the Lord when He tells Nebuchadnezzar plainly and in literal terms what his experience will be. (See verses 29-33.)

3. The chastening of the Lord in Nebuchadnezzar's case proved of great value to him. So far as the Scripture record is concerned it indicates that he proved loyal to God ever after. This case is certainly a very instructive one.
