### NOTES

1. The Chaldeans tried to make it appear that the king's request was not reasonable; but, as they pretended to communicate with the "gods whose dwelling is not with flesh," the king's request was very proper.

2. The king did not suspect Daniel of trying "to gain the time," as he suspected the wise men, for Daniel promised to show the king the interpretation of his dream; he only wanted time to seek his God for a knowledge of the secret, while they confessed that they could not interpret the dream unless the king would first tell them what it was.

3. Daniel called the brethren together to seek Him who is the Source of all wisdom, believing that the Lord would reveal the matter to him. His faith was so strong that he promised to show the king the interpretation of his dream. If all would seek the wisdom which is from above as did Daniel, they would have the knowledge of God. James 1:5.

4. In making known to Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days, or hereafter, as it is expressed in verse 45, he gave him a brief but comprehensive history of the world from his own time, till the kingdoms of this world would be overthrown by the kingdom of God. There are two important lessons that we may learn from this scripture. One is that the Lord sometimes reveals His truth to those not directly connected with His people and work, and the other is that He delights to honor His faithful servants before the great men of earth, and also deliver them from danger and death if His name can be honored thereby.
