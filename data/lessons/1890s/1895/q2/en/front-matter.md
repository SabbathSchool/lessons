# LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL

For Senior Classes

APRIL 6 TO JUNE 29, 1895

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The lessons that have been prepared for this quarter do not purport to include the entire book of Daniel, but only such portions of it as are thought to be most profitable for study in our Sabbath schools, and which can be covered by one quarter's lessons; hence we use the title, "Lessons from the Book of Daniel."

The portions of the book which have been examined contain the great lines of prophecy and prophetic periods with which all our people ought to be familiar. Some of the lessons will review a few points in the lessons of the previous quarter. This will be a decided advantage in fixing in the mind some of the great fundamental truths which make us a peculiar people.

The great importance of the careful study of these lessons, and all our Sabbath school lessons which discuss the reasons of our faith, is very forcibly set forth in Testimony No. 33, p. 236. We quote the language, and trust that it will be carefully read and faithfully heeded:â€”

"Many who profess to have a knowledge of the present truth know not what they believe. They do not understand the evidences of their faith. They have no appreciation of the work for the present time. When the time of trial shall come, there are men now preaching to others who will find, upon examining the positions they hold, that there are many things for which they can give no satisfactory reason. Until thus tested, they knew not their great ignorance. And there are many in the church who take it for granted that they understand what they believe, but, until controversy arises, they do not know their own weakness. When separated from those of like faith, and compelled to stand singly and alone to explain their belief, they will be surprised to see how confused their ideas are of what they had accepted as truth.

"God will arouse His people. If other means fail, heresies will come in among them, which will sift them, separating the chaff from the wheat. The Lord calls upon all who believe in His word to awake out of sleep. Precious light has come, appropriate for this time. It is Bible truth, showing the perils that are right upon us. This light should lead us to a diligent study of the Scriptures, and a most critical examination of the positions which we hold. God would have all the bearings and positions of truth thoroughly and perseveringly searched, with prayer and fasting. Believers are not to rest in suppositions and ill-defined ideas of what constitutes truth. Their faith must be firmly founded upon the word of God, so that when the testing time shall come, and they are brought before councils to answer for their faith, they may be able to give a reason for the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear."
