## NOTES

1. "The utmost that severity can do is to make men hypocrites; it can never make them converts." — Dr. John Moore.

2. Faith cannot be forced, neither can the conscience be guided or controlled by an appeal to arms. Any attempt, therefore, to compel men who have the courage of their convictions to do differently from what they believe, must necessarily result in persecution. It cannot result otherwise.

3. Like everything else, when Church or State is turned from its proper course, it is on the road to destruction. The truth is well stated in the following words:

"When religion and civil government are legally united, neither derives any benefit from the union; both are seriously damaged by it. The most characteristic feature of such a union is that of a bad religion and a bad government at the same time, each being harmed by the other." — Samuel T. Spear, D. D., in Religion and the State.

"Injustice and oppression are not made tolerable by being in strict accordance with the law. Nothing is surer, in the end, than the reaction of such a wrong, to break down the most perfectly constituted government." — Fairchild's Moral Philosophy, p. 186.

"Secular power has proved a Satanic gift to the church, and ecclesiastical power has proved an engine of tyranny in the hands of the State." — Dr. Phillip Schaff.
