## INTRODUCTORY

No attempt has been made in this series of lessons to treat the subject exhaustively. This would be an impossibility in so small a compass. The subject of religious liberty is a great subject, we might say, an almost inexhaustible one. Neither has any attempt been made to make an application of even all the principles brought out to the present-day movements, and bring matters, so to speak, "up to date." The idea has been rather to set forth clearly the principles themselves from a Bible standpoint, thus giving the student a good foundation upon which to build. The application of a principle is not difficult after the principle itself is once thoroughly understood.

The student will find it highly profitable and greatly to his advantage during the study of these lessons to read the work by Elder A. T. Jones entitled "The Rights of the People; or Civil Government and Religion." This is "Civil Government and Religion" revised and much enlarged.
