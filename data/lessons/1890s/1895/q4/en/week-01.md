## NOTES

1. The inordinate love for that which we may think will be of profit and pleasure to us is the cause of all the trouble there is in the world. But this is simply covetousness, and covetousness, therefore, is that which lies at the bottom of every sin. Before any other of the ten commandments can be broken, the tenth must first be transgressed. Covetousness is simply selfishness, or a desire to gratify and please self, regardless of the rights of others. This was the cause of Satan's fall in heaven (Isaiah 14:13, 14), and man's on earth (Genesis 3:4-6). And this is the ruling spirit of the Papacy, or man of sin. 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4. It is that which rules sinful men everywhere.

2. The rights of all men are equal. One man has no more inherent or natural rights than another. The framers of the Declaration of Independence enunciated a great truth when they said, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." And Christ also set forth this same principle of equality to govern in His church, when He said, "Be not ye called rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren." Matthew 23:8.

3. It is not so much by the number or length of prayers offered, or by the amount of religious ceremonies performed, that God estimates our religion, as by the way we treat our fellow-men. They are His creatures, beings whom He has made in His image. Genesis 1:27. We are to see the workmanship of God in each human being, and recognize and treat each individual as God's property. The soul of every other person is as precious in the sight of the Lord as is our own; for the same price has been paid for its redemption as for ours. Therefore, when we mistreat our fellow-men, and look down upon them, we are doing despite to God. It is a principle clearly laid down in the Bible that as we treat others God will treat us. Matthew 6:14, 15; 7:1, 2.
