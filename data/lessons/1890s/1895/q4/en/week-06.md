## NOTES

1. The complement of master is servant. Christ is the rightful Master, or Head, of every man; for He has paid the redemption price for every soul. It is therefore but a "reasonable service" that we render obedience and loyalty to Him. Romans 12:1, 2. But He forces none to serve Him; and recognizes none as His servants but those who willingly offer themselves and take the freedom He purchased for them. Isaiah 1:19; Revelation 22:17.

2. Religion — "The recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience." — Webster. Another definition quite as good is, "Man's relation of faith and obedience to God."

3. While we are to regard Christ as our Master, we are to treat our rulers with respect and recognize their authority in civil things, for they are divinely ordained to exercise such authority. We are to do this, therefore, because it is the will of God (verse 15), and we are to do this as the servants of God (verse 16). This is the proper exercise of our liberty as God's free men. There will be no conflict of authority unless men and rulers undertake to exercise authority in religious matters, and then "we ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

This is forcibly illustrated by memorable examples in Bible history, such as Daniel, the three Hebrew children; the apostles of Christ, and in later times by the martyrs of Jesus who sealed their testimony with their blood. The words of the apostle in Hebrews 11:32-40 and 12:1-3 should be a source of strength and encouragement to God's remnant people, who are soon to feel the dragon's wrath in the closing conflict of the great controversy between Christ and Satan. Christ is our Master; let us be loyal to him, and we shall surely be delivered and stand at last upon Mount Zion. Revelation 14:1.
