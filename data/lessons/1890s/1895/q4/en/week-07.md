# LESSON 7 — November 16, 1895

## THE TWO REALMS

1. WHAT is vested in the king of any kingdom? — The supreme power of that kingdom. Ecclesiastes 8:4.

2. Who is supreme in civil affairs? (See note 1.)

3. Who is supreme in religious matters?

4. What statement of Christ's shows that He distinctly recognized these two realms? Matthew 22:21.

5. When men become Christians, or subjects of God's kingdom (Romans 6:22), does God require them to cease to render to Caesar those things which belong to Caesar, and render them to Him? — No; the instruction given in Matthew 22:21 and Romans 13:1-7 forbids this.

6. On the other hand, when men become citizens of another State or civil government has the government a right to require them to render to it those things which belong to God? — No; debts cannot be discharged in this way, by paying to one what we owe to another.

7. How many are commanded to be subject to the higher powers? Romans 13:1.

8. Does this include Christians?

9. To whom are we commanded to render tribute? Verse 7.

10. To whom is tribute due? — Caesar, or earthly rulers. Why? Matthew 22:17, 21; Romans 13:4-6.

11. To whom are we to render honor? Romans 13:7.

12. What is duty toward kings? 1 Peter 2:17. (See note 2.)

13. To whom are we to pay the vows we have made to the Lord? Psalm 50:14; 76:11.

14. To whom do the tithes belong? — The Lord. Leviticus 27:30.

15. What infallible rule did the Saviour lay down by which we are to be governed in determining to whom we are to render any service or obligation? Mark 12:17.

16. How does Paul state the same principle? Romans 13:7.

17. In any case, therefore, what is the only question necessary to be decided in order to know to whom an obligation of any kind is to be rendered? — Whose is it? To whom does it belong? See Matthew 22:20.

18. Although commanded of God, why has not the State a right to compel men to pay tithes?

19. Prayer is likewise a duty enjoined in the Scriptures (Luke 18:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18; 1 Timothy 2:8); why has not the State a right to command men to pray?

20. Why not to be baptized, attend church, and partake of the Lord's Supper? (See note 3.)

21. Why has not the State a right to compel men to observe the Sabbath? (See note 4.)

22. Why has not the State the right to teach religion or to perform any religious act or ceremony? (See note 5.)

## NOTES

1. In 1 Peter 2:13, 14, Peter recognizes the king as "supreme" in the realm of earthly governments. And this realm is confined strictly to this world, to the ordinances of men, and the relations which they sustain to each other as citizens, which are civil. The ordinances of God belong to another realm. In this God is supreme, as Peter and the other apostles very plainly declared. See Acts 4:19; 5:29.

2. We are commanded not only to "honor the king," but to pray "for kings, and for all that are in authority." 1 Timothy 2:1, 2. Acting in their sphere, they are "God's ministers" (Romans 13:4, 6), ordained by Him to promote peace among men by being a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do well, and we are to respect that which God has ordained.

3. Baptism is religious. It is for the remission of sin, which is a transgression of God's law, and hence belongs to God. To Him it should be rendered. To attend church is likewise an act of religion, and should therefore be rendered to God. The Lord's Supper, as its nature indicates, belongs to God, and this determines to whom it should be rendered. Any supper the State might command men to eat would be a State supper, and not the Lord's Supper at all.

Civil governments have, however, interfered in all these matters. Justinian, in the year 533, issued a decree giving all men within the Roman Empire three months in which to be baptized and embrace Christianity, under pain of the loss of office, property, or the rights of inheritance. Bower's "History of the Popes," vol. 2, p. 334.

The Sunday law of Charles II., of England, enacted A.D. 1677, and still in force in England and many of the English colonies, provides that — 

"All the laws enacted and in force [in England] concerning the observation of the Lord's day and repairing to the church therein be carefully put in execution."

It further provides:

"That all and every person and persons whatsoever shall, on every Lord's day, apply themselves thereon in the duties of piety and true religion publiquely and privately."

This would, of course, include the celebration of the Lord's Supper, prayer, and all other like duties.

The Sunday law of Massachusetts, passed in 1782, says:

"That each person being able of body and not otherwise necessarily prevented, who shall for the space of one month together absent him or herself from the public worship of God on the Lord's day, shall forfeit and pay the sum of ten shillings, provided there be any place of worship in which they can conscientiously and conveniently attend."

The ancient Sunday law of Virginia, passed in 1610, was still more strict in this respect. It reads as follows:

"Every man shall repair in the morning to the divine service and sermons preached upon the Sabbath day, and in the afternoon to divine service and catechising, upon pain for the first fault to lose their provision and the allowance for the whole week following; for the second to lose the said allowance and also to be whipt; and for the third to suffer death."

4. Whose is the Sabbath? To whom does it belong? The settlement of this question must determine to whom the keeping of it is to be rendered, and therefore who alone has the right to command its observance. The fourth commandment does not say the seventh day is the English Sabbath, or the Dutch Sabbath, or the Puritan Sabbath, or "the holy Sabbath of America." It says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Therefore, in accordance with the command of Jesus Christ, our Saviour, to render to God the things that are God's, we are to render all our Sabbath observance to the Lord our God, to whom the Sabbath belongs. The Sabbath is the Lord's own day (Exodus 20:10; Isaiah 58:13; Mark 2:28; Revelation 1:10), and hence should be rendered to Him. Were Sunday the Lord's day, as many erroneously hold, the principle would apply just the same; the keeping of it should be rendered to the Lord and not to the State. Therefore, the State has no business whatever with the enforcement of any Sabbath keeping whatever.

5. Governments were ordained to keep men civil, and not to make them religious. While a thing may be admirably adapted to meet certain ends; it may be wholly unsuited to accomplish certain other ends. Because civil governments, through their laws and schools, do not make Christians, is no more an occasion for just complaint than the fact that a bake shop does not make pianos instead of loaves of bread. They were not established for that purpose.
