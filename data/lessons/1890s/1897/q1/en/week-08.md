### NOTES

1. "There is a terrible danger—a danger not sufficiently understood—in delaying to yield to the pleading voice of God's Holy Spirit, in choosing to live in sin; for such this delay really is.... Many are quieting a troubled conscience with the thought that they can change a course of evil when they choose; that they can trifle with the invitations of mercy, and yet be again and again impressed. They think that... in a moment of terrible extremity they can change their course. But this is not so easily done. The experience, the education, of a lifetime, has so thoroughly molded the character that few then desire to receive the image of Jesus."

2. "It is not the plan of God to compel men to yield their wicked unbelief. Before them are light and darkness, truth and error. It is for them to decide which to accept. The human mind is endowed with power to discriminate between right and wrong. God designs that men shall not decide from impulse, but from weight of evidence, carefully comparing scripture with scripture. Had the Jews laid by their prejudice, and compared written prophecy with the facts characterizing the life of Jesus, they would have perceived a beautiful harmony between the prophecies and their fulfillment in the life and ministry of the lowly Galilean."

3. "These things said Isaiah, because he saw His glory." R. V. The wonderful view granted to Isaiah was but a foreshadowing of the outshining of His glory (Heb. 1:3) as it would be revealed in Christ, and the prophet saw that such an exhibition of the glory of the Lord would simply blind the eyes of those who had persistently refused to receive the light as it was gradually revealed, and as they were able to bear it. One who persists in living in a dark cave is blinded when a bright light suddenly breaks upon his vision.

4. Men of influence were convinced that Christ's claims and teaching were true, but refrained from acknowledging them and Him for fear of losing their standing in society and the church; "for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God." R. V. The glory of fellowship with God was quite eclipsed by the glory of living in the eye of the people as wise and estimable persons.

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. Who is the Arm of the Lord? Why so called? Compare Jer. 23:6 and Rom. 1:16, 17.
2. What relation is suggested between conversion and healing? Compare Ps. 103:3.
3. What principle of true religious liberty is taught in verse 47?
4. In the judgment the believer is acquitted by the law, and the gospel witnesses to the righteousness of the acquittal; the sinner is condemned by the same law, and the same gospel witnesses to the justice of the condemnation.
5. What law of life for the Christian is suggested in verse 49?
