### NOTES

1. "Lest they should be defiled." The accusers of Jesus considered the touch of a Gentile to be a source of defilement, and on this occasion they were so afraid of being polluted that they would not enter the house of a Gentile. They could cherish malice and murder in their hearts, and imbrue their hands in the blood of Jesus, but they were exceedingly careful to avoid defilement by touching a sinner. This shows how much more concerned men will often be to avoid the violation of mere forms of religion than to have the heart pure and the life holy. Some will endeavor to quiet their consciences amid their deeds of wickedness, by the observance of the ceremonies of religion.

2. Jesus had foretold how He would be put to death, and who would do it. Matt. 20:19. He was to be crucified by the Romans, as that was their manner of executing criminals at that time. This explains the statement made in verses 31, 32. Of course the Jews secured His conviction, and were therefore held responsible for His death. John 19:11; Acts 4:10; 7:52.

3. "My kingdom is not of this world;" that is, of this world in its present state; is not given by this world, neither is it of the same nature as earthly kingdoms. They are ruled by force, and their subjects fight to defend them. Not so, however, with Christ's kingdom. He says, "If My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews." Verse 36. The Christian is not to fight with carnal weapons to defend his Master or his cause. Christ's reign now is spiritual. His dominion is over the heart, subduing evil passions and corrupt desires. Love, and not force, is the ruling principle; and while there is a warfare to be waged, the weapons are spiritual and not carnal. See 2 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 6:10-17.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. Why did Jesus answer some questions at His trial and refuse to answer others? See verses 19, 23, 33-37; 19:11; Matt. 27:11-14, and Mark 14:60-62.
2. Was it the Church or the State that put Christ to death?
3. Was there a union of the Jewish Church and the Roman State? See Mark 3:6; 12:13; Luke 20:20; Matt. 22:16. Who were the Herodians?
