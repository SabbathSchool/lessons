### NOTES

1. "That we should not be offended." "Offended" here means caused to stumble, the same as in Matt. 11:6; 18:6-9; 26:31, and many other New Testament passages. It does not mean angry, as we might be led to conclude from the use and meaning of the word in our day.

2. "It is expedient for you that I go away." It would be better for God's people for Christ to go away, and send them the Comforter, because Christ could only be present in person in one place at the same time, whereas the Comforter could be present everywhere at all times, to convict, convert, and sanctify the people. Hence, in order to have the gospel do its work in every part of the world it was necessary for Jesus to go away, and for the Comforter to come.

3. "Reprove" is translated from a word which includes the meaning of the words "convince" and "convict." The work of the Comforter relates to sin, righteousness, and judgment. He convicts us of sin and cleanses us from it. He convinces of Christ's righteousness and brings it to us. He convinces us of a future judgment and prepares us for it. He convicts the world of sin "because they believe not on Me." That is, without faith in Christ, condemnation still rests upon them. "Of righteousness, because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more." That is, as the Saviour was going away, the Comforter would manifest, or reveal, God's righteousness, teach its principles, and implant them in the hearts of men. Verses 12-15. "Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged." That is, as Satan, the prince of this world, was judged or cast out (see John 12:31; Rev. 12:7-13), at the close of the Saviour's work on earth, so the Comforter would convince and convict the world of a final judgment, when all must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.

4. "He will show you things to come." Thus our Lord clearly taught His people that the Holy Spirit would move upon the hearts of His servants in this dispensation and reveal to them future events, as well as in ancient times; in other words, that the gift of prophecy would be exercised in the Christian church. See Acts 2:38, 39; Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:1, 7-10, 28; Eph. 4:11-13.

5. By comparing verse 16 with John 14:1-3, it is evident that Jesus is referring to his going to heaven to prepare a place for His people.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. Why did none of them ask Christ, "Whither goest Thou"?
2. What work upon the heart does the Spirit of God perform? See 2 Cor. 3:3; Heb. 8:10.
3. How was the "prince of this world" judged?
4. How does the Spirit of God show us things to come?
5. Are there any other parties to the partnership mentioned in verse 15?
