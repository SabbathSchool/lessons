### NOTES

1. "They will keep yours also." Those who are acquainted with the Lord's sayings (the Word of God), and keep them, will always have ears to hear His servants, and hearts to keep their sayings. Those who know the voice of the Good Shepherd will be able to distinguish between the voice of the false and true under shepherds, not only because they are acquainted with God's Word, but because they are so fully acquainted with the Spirit of God in their own experience. They will not believe every spirit, but they will try the spirits (1 John 4:1), and thus be able to discern who are the servants of God, and who are the "false apostles, deceitful workers" (2 Cor. 11:13-15). Thus those who keep Christ's sayings will keep the sayings of His true servants.

2. "They had not had sin." An important truth is taught in verse 22. Jesus said, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin." That is, their guilt was proportionate to the light given them. This was not only true of the Jews then, but it has always been true of all classes, and it is true today. It is a truth of general application. The light we have determines our responsibility. Christ did not mean that the people would be sinless if He had not come with greater light, but that with the greater light they would be left without excuse for sin. The law entered—was spoken—that the offense might abound (Rom. 5:20), and that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful (Rom. 7:13). The Lord gives light and instruction, not to increase our guilt, but that we may sense our guilt, and thus be led to accept Christ and receive His abounding grace. See Gal. 3:24; Rom. 5:20. Those who sin without law—without light and instruction—shall also perish without law. Rom. 2:12. Christ came to give light, not to condemn the world, but to save the world. John 3:16, 17. Without light and salvation through Christ all would perish (Acts 4:12); for all have sinned (Rom. 3:10, 23; 5:12, 21).

3. "From the beginning." That is, from the commencement of His public work. Luke uses the same expression (Luke 1:2), and refers to the same time in verse 3, when he says "from the very first," and in Acts 1:21, 22. Paul also mentions it, using the expression "at the first" (Heb. 2:3).

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. When did Christ give His life for man? See Rev. 13:8. What was the nature of the life which He gave?
2. What is meant by the expression in verse 16, "and that your fruit should remain"?
3. Why are God's people persecuted? Is it because they are good, or is it because their persecutors are bad? Verses 18, 19, 21, 25, and John 16:3.
