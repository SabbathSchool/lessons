### NOTES

1. When Pilate asked Jesus the question, "Whence art Thou?" Jesus gave him no answer. Verse 9. "Pilate was vexed at the silence of Jesus, and haughtily addressed Him: 'Speakest Thou not unto me? knowest Thou not that I have power to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee?' Jesus answered, 'Thou couldest have no power at all against Me, except it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered Me unto thee hath the greater sin.' Jesus here laid the heaviest burden of guilt upon the Jewish judges, who had received unmistakable evidence of the divinity of Him whom they had condemned to death, both from the prophecies and His own teachings and miracles. What a scene was this to hand down to the world through all time! The pitying Saviour, in the midst of His intense suffering and grief, excuses as far as possible the act of Pilate, who might have released Him from the power of His enemies."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 145.

The Saviour's answer shows that no power can be exercised against the cause or people of God, except what the Lord permits, and the Lord will permit that only which will be for the good of those who love Him. This should be a source of great comfort to the tempted, buffeted, persecuted child of God as he battles with Satan and the powers of darkness.

2. The statement made in verse 14, that it was about the sixth hour when the trial closed and the decision was made to crucify Jesus, presents a chronological difficulty when compared with the statements made in the other Gospels. Various theories or ideas have been advanced for the purpose of removing the difficulty. The one most generally adopted is that there was an error in transcribing the numeral in verse 14. This would not be a strange mistake, because it has been proven that it was common at that time to use letters to indicate numbers, instead of writing them out in words, and that the letters which were used to represent the numbers three and six might easily be mistaken for each other. Therefore the conclusion is reached that the numeral letter in John 19:14 should have been transcribed third instead of sixth, and thus it would harmonize with the statements in the other Gospels.

3. The great lengths to which people will go in wickedness and oppression when they reject light and close their minds and hearts against the evidences of truth, is illustrated in the cases of Pilate and the chief priests. "Pilate had taken step after step in the violation of his conscience, and in excusing himself from judging with equity and fairness, as his position demanded he should do, until now he found himself almost helpless in the hands of the Jews." "His wavering and indecision proved his irredeemable ruin. How many, like Pilate, sacrifice principle and integrity, in order to shun disagreeable consequences! Conscience and duty point one way, and self-interest points another; and the current, setting strongly in the wrong direction, sweeps away into the thick darkness of guilt him who compromises with evil."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 142, 147.

But, as before shown, Jesus laid the heaviest burden of guilt upon the Jewish judges, because they had greater light, both from the prophecies and Christ's teachings and miracles.

### SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS

1. What relation did the crown of thorns which Jesus wore bear to the curse mentioned in Gen. 3:17, 18?
2. Pilate said, "Behold the man;" John the Baptist cried, "Behold the Lamb of God;" what think ye of Christ?
3. Read John 11:47-50. They started out to save the nation by crucifying Christ. What were they finally willing to do to compass His death? (See John 19:15.)
