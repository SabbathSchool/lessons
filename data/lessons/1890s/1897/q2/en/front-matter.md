"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." Deut. 6:6, 7.

## PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS.

**SABBATH.**—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, or repeating the lesson scripture. Read the lesson for the intermediate division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.

**SUNDAY.**—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:

1. Assign a verse to each member of the family.
2. Then read the lesson scripture, carefully considering what each verse says before reading the next. Be sure to have each member of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each verse.
3. Select two verses to be committed to memory during the day.
4. Repeat the memory verse.

**MONDAY.**—Review the portion of the lesson already studied.

1. Give each an opportunity to repeat the two verses that were to be committed to memory the previous day.
2. Let one ask the questions from the LESSON QUARTERLY, and others answer in turn in the words of the Scripture.
3. Study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the first half was studied on Sunday.

**TUESDAY.**—Repeat the verses already committed to memory, and ask the questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand the questions and the meaning of the words used in them.

Select two more verses to be committed to memory during the day.

**WEDNESDAY.**—Repeat the verses committed to memory, and review the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY, the Instructor, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. The number and age of the children would usually indicate, which would be best.

**THURSDAY.**—Read the lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in the Sabbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and review the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the LESSON QUARTERLY. Repeat the verses committed to memory.

**FRIDAY.**—Thoroughly review the entire lesson in the following manner:

1. Ask the questions as found in the LESSON QUARTERLY.
2. Call upon different ones to give a synopsis of the lesson or the lesson story in their own language.
3. Let each one repeat as much of the lesson scripture as possible.
4. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson.

**SABBATH.**—Review practical truths of the lesson, and relate personal experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been found helpful.

(This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of thorough, regular, systematic study of the Scriptures as given in our Sabbath-school lessons.)
