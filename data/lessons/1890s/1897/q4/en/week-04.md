## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. With the first part of this lesson, and the preceding one as well, the first chapter of Galatians may profitably be studied. Read also 2 Cor. 11:32, 33.
2. Verse 23 says that "after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took council to kill him;" how long a time does this cover? Where did Saul go in this time?
3. How long did Saul stay in Jerusalem on his first visit after his conversion? With whom did he dwell?
4. When miracles were wrought by the hand of Peter, to whom did the people turn? On whom did they believe? When Simon the sorcerer did great works, to whom did the people turn? Is there anything in this that will help us to discern between the work of the Lord and the work of Satan?
5. Why was the healing of Aeneas recorded? John 20:31. What lesson does it contain for us? What significance in the fact that Peter uses the present tense, "maketh," instead of the future, "will make"?
