### NOTES

1. "Unlearned and ignorant men." The Greek word is idiotes, from which comes our word "idiot." Its primary meaning, however, is "common people," or, as the German and Danish have it, "layfolk." The idea of ignorance is a secondary one derived from the Pharisaic notion that common people could not be expected to know anything. It was the common people, however, who gladly listened to Jesus, and the common people who are taught by Him "in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Colossians 2:3), have more true wisdom than all those who profess themselves to be wise. Compare Proverbs 2:1-9; Psalm 119:99, 100; Romans 1:21, 22.

2. The disciples said, "We cannot but speak the things that we have seen and heard." Would it have been as well if they had said, "We will not cease preaching," or, "We have a right to preach the Gospel"? What would have been the difference?
