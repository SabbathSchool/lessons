## WISE COUNSEL
(Chapter 5:33 to 6:15.)

### QUESTIONS

1. Repeat the substance of the words spoken to the Jewish council by the apostles.
2. What effect did this talk have upon the council? What did they plan to do?
3. Who then came forward? What was his standing among them? Before he began to speak about the case, what did he command?
4. When the apostles had been removed, what did he say to the council?
5. What two examples did he cite of men who had started fanatical or seditious movements?
6. What was the result in each case?
7. In view of those things, what was Gamaliel's advice concerning the apostles? What did he say would become of their work if it was of men?
8. But if it were of God, then what would opposition avail? Against whom would opposers be fighting?
9. What did the council think of Gamaliel's advice? Nevertheless, what did their rage impel them to do? What did they again command the apostles?
10. With what spirit did the apostles leave the judgment-hall?
11. How did they regard the injunction of the council?
12. What was the natural result of such zealous and faithful witnessing? What took place when the multitude of believers became very great? What was the cause of the complaint?
13. What did the twelve then say of their own work?
14. What measure did the apostles propose in order to relieve them of the burden of looking after financial matters? What kind of men did they say should be chosen to attend to the business?
15. What did the apostles say that they themselves would do?
16. How did this proposal strike the brethren? Whom did they choose?
17. How were they set apart? What followed this division of labor? From what class of people were many converts made?
18. Who seemed to be the most prominent among the seven men who had been chosen by the church? What did he do besides attending to the distribution of funds?
19. Who set themselves against his work?
20. What could they not do?
21. When they could accomplish nothing by argument, what did they do?
22. Having stirred up a feeling among the people, what charge was brought against Stephen before the council?
23. What did they declare they had heard him say?
24. What effect did these violent proceedings have upon Stephen's peace of mind?

### NOTE

It is a point worthy of note, that these seven men were not appointed to raise money, but to distribute it. When the believers are all of one heart and soul, being filled with the Holy Ghost, and are bearing their testimony with the power of the Spirit, the question is not how means shall be obtained, but how to distribute the abundance that flows in. Notice also that the men who have to do with the financial part of the work of the Lord, need to have as much of the Holy Ghost as those who preach the Word.
