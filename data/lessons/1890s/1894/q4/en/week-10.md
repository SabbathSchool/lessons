## NOTE

1. One malefactor said in derision, "If thou be Christ, save Thyself and us." He had no confidence in Christ's claims. In common with all the people, he had a vague expectation that Messiah would come, but he, like the others, looked for a mighty warrior, who should deliver them from merely temporal ills. What the malefactor asked was impossible. Christ could not save Himself and them. He could save men only by the sacrifice of Himself. "With His stripes we are healed." The words of the malefactor that first spoke showed that he had no conception of the character and work of Christ. But into the mind and heart of the other one, the light of faith had dawned. He saw in Christ the Deliverer from sin and death. His request was, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom." This prayer was answered. Christ promised that the thief should be with Him in Paradise. When He comes in His kingdom, an event still future, the thief will be remembered. He could not be with Christ before, for none can be taken to be with Him until He comes the second time, to take them to Himself. See John 14:1-3. The circumstances under which the promise was made necessarily called forth an emphatic declaration, "Verily, I say unto thee to-day."
Christ could not save Himself from the cross, but, hanging on the cross, with all men reviling Him, and even the heavens seemingly against Him, He could speak salvation to the believing sinner.
