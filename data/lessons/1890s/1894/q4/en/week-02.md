# LESSON 2 - October 13, 1894

## CHILDREN OF THE RESURRECTION
### Luke 20:27-47

There are three distinct topics in this lesson. Read the verses carefully, note the topics and the verses occupied by each, and see in how few words you can name each topic. Review the entire chapter, and then see how many of the particulars of each topic you can recall in their order.

1. In what two ways, as already learned in this chapter, did the chief priests and the scribes seek to entrap Jesus?
2. Who next sought to entangle Him?
3. What was one peculiarity of the Sadducees?
4. What case did they lay before Jesus?
5. What was the problem which they asked Him to solve?
6. Whose writings did the Sadducees profess to believe?
7. What did Jesus say to them? Of what were they ignorant?
8. What did He say about the marriage relation in the world to come?
9. Unto whom are the children of the resurrection equal? In what respect?
10. Whose writings did Jesus quote as teaching the resurrection of the dead?
11. Quote the scripture and tell where it is found.
12. Of whom does the Lord declare Himself to be the God?
13. What did the scribes say to this answer?
14. What effect did these answers of Jesus have upon those who wished to entrap Him?
15. What question did Jesus then put to His adversaries?
16. Were they able to answer it? See Matt. 22:46.
17. Against whom did Jesus then warn His disciples?
18. What traits were there about them that should be avoided?

## NOTES

1. The Sadducees rejected all the Scriptures except the writings of Moses. Jesus showed that they did not know and accept even his writings. If they had, they would have believed the resurrection. At one time He said, "Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me; for he wrote of Me." John 5:46. Moses wrote the gospel, just as surely as did Luke and John.

2. "Now that the dead are raised," or, as in Mark 12:26, "As touching the dead, that they rise," "even Moses showed at the bush." The Lord is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He called Himself their God, many years after they were dead. That cannot be taken to mean that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were not really dead, for then they would not need a resurrection, and there would be no point in Christ's reference to it as proof of the resurrection. But God "quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were." Rom. 4:17.

3. "Beware of the scribes," etc. The reason why they were to be avoided was because of their pride and selfishness. Therefore it was their characteristics rather than their persons that Jesus warned His disciples against. Consequently, we shall receive the most benefit from the Lord's words if, instead of being on the watch against persons with the character that He describes, we keep on our guard against such traits in ourselves.
