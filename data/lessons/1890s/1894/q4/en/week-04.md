## NOTES

1. "Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at His word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for My name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but He shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed." Isa. 66:5. The coming of the Lord is a joyful event to His people. Therefore when they see the signs of His coming, they will rejoice. While the hearts of men are failing them for fear, for looking after those things that shall come on the earth, their hearts will be filled with joy.

2. "As a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth." The coming of the Lord will be at a time when men would not naturally expect it, when the world has no thought of it. But it will not take the people of God unawares. See 1 Thess. 5:1-5. They are not dwellers on the earth, but only sojourners. They are strangers and pilgrims. People may have their portion as dwellers on this earth, and be ashamed at the coming of the Lord, or they may be content to be strangers, and rejoice in that day.
