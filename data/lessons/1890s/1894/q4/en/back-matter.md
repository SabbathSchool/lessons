# Apples of Gold Library

## ENVELOPE SERIES:

This is the title of a little monthly publication recently started by the Pacific Press Publishing Co., and is designed especially for use in personal correspondence. Each number will contain from four to eight pages of a size convenient to go into a number six envelope without folding. It is printed on thin super-calendered paper, and one or two numbers can be put in with an ordinary letter without increasing the postage.

It is the object of the publishers to present in this Library the leading themes of the gospel in such a way as to arrest the attention and create a desire to read more, and thus lead souls to Christ and his salvation. It is not intended that these leaflets shall take the place of the Bible Students' Library or any other publication, but they are to be used by gospel workers in their daily correspondence. A package should be kept on hand, and when writing to a friend, inclose one or more copies, and thus "sow beside all waters."

The following numbers have already been issued:

| No. 1. | Looking to Jesus. |
|--------|-------------------|
| No. 2. | The Christian's Privilege. |
| No. 3. | The Sure Promises of God. |
| No. 4. | How to Get Knowledge. |
| No. 5. | The Church and the World. (Poetry.) |
| No. 6. | The Elect of God |
| No. 7. | How Esther Read Her Bible. |
| No. 8. | The Thief on the Cross. |
| No. 9. | The Eleventh Hour. |
| No. 10. | Benefits of Bible Study. |
| No. 11. | Righteousness: Where Is It to Be Found? |
| No. 12. | The Power of Forgiveness. |
| No. 13. | Responsibility of Parents. |
| No. 14. | Choose Ye This Day. |
| No. 15. | The Cross of Christ. |

5 copies for one year, postpaid, 50 cents; or 12 copies for $1.00. Single subscriptions are not desirable, for two reasons: 1. The numbers being so small they are liable to be lost in the mails. 2. If they are used in correspondence, as recommended, more than one copy would be necessary.

Single or assorted numbers of the Library will be mailed in quantities at the following rates: 50 cents per hundred, $4.00 per thousand copies. Always order by the NUMBER.
