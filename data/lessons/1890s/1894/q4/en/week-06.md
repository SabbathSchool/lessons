## NOTES

1. It was necessary that Christ should suffer for man; for "without the shedding of blood there is no remission." But it was not necessary that any man should betray Him. "God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." This gift was made in the beginning, and not simply when Christ hung on the cross. The plan of salvation was ample enough to embrace every man born into the world. It was not necessary that a few men should be left out, in order that Christ should be betrayed and murdered. Even with all the hatred that men manifested to Him, they did not take His life. He laid down His own life. No man could take it from Him. John 10:18. Christ could have laid down His own life as a sacrifice for man, if every soul had loved and obeyed Him. So, although it was determined that Christ should suffer and die, and it was foretold that men should betray Him and crucify Him, they did it of their own free will.

2. In the church of Christ, there is to be no lordship. That is left for the world. It is true that the apostate church modeled itself after the fashion of the world, and worldly methods have been brought into the church. But that is not according to Christ. He came as a servant. Matt. 20:25-28; Phil. 2:7. The greatest in the kingdom of God will be Christ, and He is the One that will have performed the most and the lowest service. Exaltation is found only in serving.
