# A STUDY OF THE BOOK OF LUKE

## THIRD PART

### To be Thoughtfully and Carefully Read

THOSE who have been studying the book of Luke diligently for the past six months have doubtless gained, besides a pretty thorough acquaintance with the first eleven chapters, considerable experience in study. It will not be necessary therefore, in the remaining lessons, to note the analysis so closely, neither will so many notes be given to aid the student, as heretofore. A few suggestions here may serve for every lesson. At the same time recall the suggestions made in previous lessons. They are of a general nature, and are adapted to all Bible study.

1. Do not get the idea that any given analysis of a chapter is the analysis. That which will best serve to bring the contents of the chapter to your mind is the best for you. The essential thing is to master the contents of a book, chapter by chapter. It is obvious that no one can be said to be familiar with the Bible, or with any part of it, unless he knows definitely what is in it, and where to find it.

2. Think as you read and study. The inspired direction is, "Consider what I say," and the promise that follows is, "for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things." 2 Tim. 2:7, R. V.

3. Do not, therefore, try to find out what somebody else thinks. Another's thoughts may be all right, but if you take another's thoughts, he does the thinking, and you do not, and he gets the benefit, while you do not. The injunction, "Consider what I say," is to each one.

4. Remember that no man's opinion about the Bible is of any value. Even a very good man may be mistaken; but the Spirit of the Lord is never mistaken. It is given to teach us all things, and to reveal to us the deep things of God. Learn to ask wisdom from the Source of Wisdom (see Col. 2:2, 3; James 1:5, 6), and to expect an answer. This is not saying that any one of us is independent of others, and can receive no help from them; but whatever help comes to us must be the word of God, and not human opinions. Other people are of no help to us if they give us their opinions instead of the word of God.

5. Never guess what a text means, and don't adopt somebody else's guesses. If the meaning of any text is not obvious, meditate on it, compare it with other texts, and do not be impatient in your study. Do not expect to know everything at once. Learn to wait on the Lord. If in this study you make it your principal object to get an intimate acquaintance with the facts recorded, and the place where each event is recorded, you will gain as much as can possibly be expected.

6. Finally, do not argue or debate over Scripture. To do so is fatal to an understanding of it. You cannot study the Bible in a crowd. Study must be done alone. "Be still, and know that I am God." Ps. 46:10. It was not in the tempest, but in the still, small voice that the Lord was revealed to Elijah. Noise and clamor are incompatible with efficient Bible study. Study in silence with the Lord. Jesus is just as able to open the Scriptures to you, and to open your understanding, as He was when on earth in the flesh. See Luke 24:32-45. Go to Him and let your faith make Him a real Presence near at hand, and you will find that the opening of His "words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple." Ps. 119:130, R. V. "For the Lord giveth wisdom; out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding." Prov. 2:6.
