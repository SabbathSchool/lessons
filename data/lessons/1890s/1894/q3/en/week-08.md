# LESSON 8 - August 25, 1894
## GIVING NO OFFENSE AND GLORIFYING GOD
### Luke 17:1-19

The sixteenth chapter of Luke includes two parables,—the unfaithful steward, and the rich man and Lazarus. The chapter is not omitted from detailed consideration in this study because it is unimportant, but because it is thought better not to open the way for the speculation and controversy that would inevitably arise in a class study of the two parables. Each one would have a theory as to the meaning of the parables, and the time of the class would be worse than wasted. It is evident from verses 14 and 15 that the entire chapter is directed against covetousness. Let each one meditate upon the parables more than he ever did before, but forbearing to speculate or to indulge in any fancies as to what they mean. In the meantime, the continuity of this study of the book of Luke will be unbroken if you remember that the sixteenth chapter is devoted to the two parables.

In the lesson before us we have a warning against causing any to stumble; an illustration of the fact that we have nothing by which we place God under any obligation to us; and the account of the healing of ten lepers, only one of whom thanked God.

9. If one has a servant, what will be expected of him?
10. When the servant waits upon his master, what only does he do?
11. What might be said of us if we had done all that is commanded us?

18. What did one of them do when he saw that he was healed?
19. Who was this one?
20. What did Jesus say about it?

### NOTES

1. "Offenses." The Revised Version has "occasions of stumbling." The Greek word is skandala—scandals. The idea is not of things by which one may be personally affronted, but of sin of any kind—things whereby one stumbles.

2. "Take heed to yourselves." Compare Gal. 6:1. "If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted." The Revised Version omits the words "against thee." "If thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him." This removes the personal element, which should not appear in any case. Our duty to restore a brother is as great if the offense be against somebody else as though it were against us, and we are to have no more feeling over the matter because our personal rights have been interfered with than though the offense was against a stranger.

3. In the fourth verse we have offenses against the individual referred to. If a brother trespass against us seven times in a day, and seven times turns and says, "I repent," we are to forgive him. We cannot suppose that this limits the number of times we are to forgive; for he who would keep count of the number of times that he was trespassed against, and the number of times that he had forgiven, so as to be sure not to overstep the number, would thereby show that there was no real spirit of forgiveness in him. The idea is that there is to be nothing but a spirit of forgiveness all the time. "And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another; even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." Eph. 4:32. How does God forgive?—"All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ. ... As though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." 2 Cor. 5:18-20. Notice that if the brother shall say, "I repent," we are to forgive him. We are not to inquire into his motives nor his sincerity.

4. "And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith;" literally, "add to us faith." Whether the apostles really asked for an increase of faith, or that they might have faith, makes no difference; for the Saviour's answer shows that if one has faith at all it is sufficient. Faith cannot exist with doubt. If one has faith as a grain of mustard seed, he has no doubt whatever; and therefore he can do all things that may be done by faith. Such forgiveness as is here enjoined cannot be done without faith; for we are to forgive as God forgives, and that can be done only with His Spirit, which is ours only by faith.

5. Eph. 6:5-9 shows the proper relation between masters and servants, as also in Matt. 20:25-28. No one is to exhibit a lordly disposition toward any other. All are brethren, and there is no respect of persons with God. Therefore Luke 17:7-9 cannot be construed as teaching that employers need not be grateful for services rendered by employes. Jesus took the ordinary condition of things as an illustration. The lesson that we are to learn is not to expect that whatever we do we are adding anything to the Lord, so that He is under obligation to us. Let no one think that in a few short years he can earn an eternal reward. "The gift of God is eternal life."
