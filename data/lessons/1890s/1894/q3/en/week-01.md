### NOTES

1. With verses 2 and 3 may be compared Eccl. 12:14; 1 Cor. 3:18; 4:5. The hypocrite hides his real character from a few, only to have it fully exposed to the multitude in the judgment.

2. "You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." Col. 3:3. "In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind." Job 12:10. God can utterly destroy, while man cannot, though he burn the body to ashes and scatter them to the four winds. Therefore the righteous need never fear what man may attempt to do.

3. "Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered." Some choose to believe that this is figurative, and not an actual fact. They think so because of the seeming impossibility of the thing; but that is measuring God by man. "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God." Luke 18:27. Compare Ps. 139:1-6. God even remembers every sparrow. With confidence then can we trust ourselves in His hands, when we are assured that He not only knows, but that He cares for us. 1 Peter 5:7.

4. Without trying to define just what constitutes blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, it is sufficient to note one or two points. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9. This assures us that everyone who wants forgiveness is sure to receive it. Therefore it is certain that no matter how grievously one has sinned, he has not committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, if he desires forgiveness. No repentant soul is rejected by the Lord. "Him that cometh to Me, I will in nowise cast out." John 6:37. This should be sufficient to comfort the hearts of those who tremble lest they have committed the unpardonable sin. The man who has committed that sin is not troubled over it.

5. "For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to speak." Still more emphatic is the instruction in Luke 21:12-16. But one who receives the Spirit's aid at such a time must have formed an acquaintance with the Spirit before that time. He must previously have learned to depend upon the Spirit for guidance in speaking. The one who has never dared to speak God's message without settling beforehand just what he would say, will not be likely to begin in the greatest emergency of his life. But not taking thought what one shall say, or how he shall speak, does not mean neglect of preparation. The word of God must be meditated upon day and night. "Meditate on these things; give thyself wholly to them," is the instruction of Paul to every servant of God.

6. "Thou fool." The fool is the one who says in his heart, "There is no God." Ps. 14:1. This was just what the rich man in the parable said. Every man whose soul is absorbed in amassing wealth for himself and for his children, as well as the poor man whose anxiety day and night is how he can make a living, really says in his heart, "There is no God." He acts as though God were not in existence, and everything depended on himself. Life is something besides eating and drinking and having plenty of clothing. Life, indeed, is rest in God, and trust in His care. "He that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." 1 John 5:12.
