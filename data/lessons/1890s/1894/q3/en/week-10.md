### NOTES

1. Too many people make a mistake in reading the parable of the unjust judge. They seem to think that it is an illustration of how God deals with men, and an indication that we shall receive notice only by long effort. We should remember that the judge was unjust, and that God is just. There is no comparison, but contrast, between the judge and God. God is listening to hear before we ask. 1 Peter 3:12. He has provided the way for us to come to Him, and asks us to come boldly. He delights in mercy. Micah 7:18. The reason why we are to be encouraged to continue instant in prayer, and not to faint, is that God is so kind and ready to give. "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Rom. 8:32.

2. The best rendering of the latter part of verse 7 is, "And He is long-suffering with them." The idea is not that God will finally listen to the cries of His people, although He will hold them off for a long time, but that He will do just the opposite of the unjust judge, because He is long-suffering with them. God will not make His people wait long for an answer to their prayers. "I tell you that He will avenge them speedily." But note that this is when His people are so much in earnest that they cry day and night unto Him, and not only occasionally.

3. "Why callest thou me good? None is good, save One, that is God." As shown by the texts referred to in the questions, and by many others not referred to, Christ is absolutely good. "There is no unrighteousness in Him." What then did He mean by what He said to the young man? It is evident that He could not have meant anything else than to impress upon his mind the fact that He Himself was God. See John 1:1-14. If the young man had but recognized that, he would have had an answer to His question; for "this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." John 17:3. If the young man had kept all the commandments, what could he lack? Are there duties that lie outside the range of the ten commandments? "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13. But the result showed that the young man was deceived. He had not kept all the commandments. Indeed, he had not kept any of them. He was covetous; he loved himself better than he did his neighbor. Thus we have the second great principle of the law violated. But to break the second principle means the violation of the first. "For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen." 1 John 4:20, Revised Version.
