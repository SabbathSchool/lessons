# THE SABBATH QUESTION
## IS THE LEADING SUBJECT OF THE DAY

THE GREAT DEMAND OF THE HOUR, FROM THE PULPIT AND THE PRESS, IN SOCIAL CIRCLES AND IN LEGISLATIVE HALLS, IS

That the Sabbath be more strictly observed. To assist the intelligent-minded of our land to have correct views of this important question, a book has been prepared which thoroughly discusses the Sabbatic institution in every conceivable phase. Such is the valuable work entitled

"History of the Sabbath and the First Day of the Week."

By ELD. J. N. ANDREWS.

This great and exhaustive work is the result of ten years' hard labor and historical research. The book contains 548 12mo pages, and is printed in clear type, on good paper, and is well bound. Price, post-paid, $2.00.
