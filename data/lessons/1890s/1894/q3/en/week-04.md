### NOTES

1. We may learn from the parable of the barren fig tree that those who bear no fruit will be cut off. Compare John 15:1-6. But we may also learn the long-suffering of Christ, and be encouraged. We well know that one who had taken great pains with a tree, cultivating and dressing it carefully, without seeing any fruit, would not cut it down the fourth year, if it bore but a little fruit. "Every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit." "He which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ." Phil. 1:6.

2. Jesus said, "It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days." Matt. 12:12. To break the power of Satan is always a good thing, and work most appropriate for the Sabbath day. See Luke 4:18 for a statement of the special work of Christ. We must not fail to note the ease with which Christ breaks the bonds of Satan. His power is no less now than it was then; and He is present with us no less really than He was then. And the Sabbath day is most appropriate for such deliverances, for it was given for the express purpose of teaching us God's power to save. See Eze. 20:12; Ps. 92:1-4.

3. Notice that Jesus did not give a direct answer to the question of curiosity, "Are there few that be saved?" He told us, indeed, that the multitude will go the broad way, but we are not therefore to boast, as though we were better than they. We are not to indulge in speculations as to who will or will not be saved. When one said to Jesus, "Are there few that be saved?" He replied, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate," as much as to say, "Look out for yourself, and don't speculate about somebody else." When Peter was curious as to what was to become of John, Jesus said to him, "What is that to thee? follow thou Me." John 21:21, 22.

4. "Strive to enter in." People misuse this text in two directions. Some say, "I have striven with all the power I had, and it is of no use, because I failed every time; I might as well give up; I am too weak to do anything." Others will think that it means that the power is in themselves, and that they are required to do it all. They have made failures, but they attribute them to the fact that they did not strive hard enough. Jesus says, "Without Me ye can do nothing." John 15:5. This shows that there is no power in man. All power in heaven and earth belongs to Christ. Matt. 28:18. It is His Spirit that supplies the power with which we are to strive. See Eph. 3:16; Col. 1:11-13; Zech. 4:6. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure." Phil. 2:12, 13. The apostle Paul said, "I labor, striving according to His working, that worketh in me mightily." Col. 1:29. Remember that, although Jacob wrestled all night, he gained no victory until his strength was gone, and he had to throw himself upon the Lord for support.
