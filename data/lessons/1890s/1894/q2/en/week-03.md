# LESSON 16 - April 21, 1894

## SAVED BY FAITH
### Luke 7:36-50

This lesson contains only one subject,â€”the anointing of Jesus by the sinful woman, in the house of Simon the Pharisee, and her forgiveness. Study the story well, until you are familiar with every detail. Then you can feed upon the comfort that there is in it. An analysis of this entire chapter may very readily be made, sufficient to bring it before the mind. Thus: Healing of the centurion's servant; raising the son of the widow of Nain; inquiries of John the Baptist; extolling him and upbraiding the Pharisees; forgiving the repentant woman in the house of Simon.

### NOTES

1. "This man, if He were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him; for she is a sinner." So spake the Pharisee within himself. He didn't know the Lord, and there are many today who are just as little acquainted with Him. Christ came to save sinners. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners." 1 Tim. 1:15. That which the Pharisee thought would be the reason why Jesus would not receive the woman, was the very reason why He did.

2. The woman knew the Lord better than the Pharisee did. His frowns could not deter her from coming to Jesus. Whenever a sinner seeks to come to Jesus, the devil undertakes to keep him away. He says to the sinner, "You are too vile to approach so pure a being; you are not fit to associate with him." And then he quotes Scripture to the sinner. He says that the Lord is "of purer eyes than to behold evil" (Hab. 1:13), and evil shall not dwell with Him (Ps. 5:4, 5). Too often the sinner is frightened away, but if he is as wise as the poor, sinful woman in this lesson, he will only press the closer, saying, "Since evil cannot dwell with the Lord, I will abide with Him, and thus my sin will be driven away."

3. "To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." The Pharisee had not shown common courtesy, much less love, to Jesus. His heart had not been touched by the love of God, and he had not received forgiveness. This was not because of God's unwillingness to forgive, but because of his self-righteousness. A man will love in proportion to what he has been forgiven; but if he is so self-righteous that he feels little need of forgiveness, of course he will not be moved to love. Therefore the ones who love the Lord the most are the ones who have the greatest sense of their own sinfulness.

4. "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." Whatever gospel truth we find expressed in the writings of the apostles, we shall find illustrated in the ministry of Christ. The apostle Paul wrote, "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. 5:1. In this lesson we have a practical illustration of that statement. Many who are longing for peace fail to find it, because they seek for it in the wrong way. They are looking for peace as an evidence that they are accepted with God, whereas peace comes as the result of knowing one's acceptance with God. "Being justified, . . . we have peace." But right here many still err. They think that peace is merely a state of feeling, and so they look for a certain indescribable feeling of peace, and if they do not have it, they are in darkness and despondency. Those who depend on this feeling will have a fitful experience, and run the risk of fatal deception. All should understand that peace is not feeling, but an actual fact. It is reality, and not imagination or sentiment. Peace does not depend on feeling, and there may be, and often is, absolute peace with God and no feeling whatever. If this were not so, then a knowledge of acceptance with God would be only a matter of feeling after all. For if a certain feeling must always accompany peace, then one would have only to consult his feelings to know whether or not he is justified, since peace always accompanies justification. One's feelings are from himself, but peace with God comes from God. One can understand his own feelings, even though he cannot describe them; but the peace of God "passeth all understanding." Phil. 4:7. It is God who speaks peace to His people. Ps. 85:8. God is "the God of peace" (Heb. 13:20), and Christ is the "Prince of peace" (Isa. 9:6.) "He is our peace." Eph. 2:14. Christ is a real being, and not a mere feeling; and we have peace with God only by having Christ, who dwells in our hearts by faith. Eph. 3:17. So peace, like righteousness, is ours only by faith. And this is so because it is not simply a consequence that follows the receiving of righteousness, but it accompanies righteousness, as a part of it. "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other." Ps. 85:10. "The work of righteousness shall be peace." Isa. 32:17. Righteousness is the character of the God of peace and the Prince of peace. We get righteousness by getting the life and character of God in Christ. But we get peace in the same way, since peace is as much the life of God as is righteousness. So we get righteousness and peace by taking Christ for all that He is. His peace was unruffled by all the tribulations which He endured; He is used to such things, and therefore will not leave us when tribulations come. To everyone He says, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." John 16:33.
