# A STUDY OF THE BOOK OF LUKE
## Second Part.

### TO BE THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY READ.

Although with this quarter you have a new lesson pamphlet, do not neglect the old one. Read again the introduction to the lessons, and keep in mind the suggestions as to study that are found in nearly every lesson. Remember, however, that the lesson is in the Bible, and not in the pamphlet. Do not neglect the study of preceding chapters, as you advance. Make it a practice to give a synopsis of the chapters already studied, as often as once a day. As you do this, by yourself, let your mind call up as complete a picture as possible of each topic as it is mentally pronounced. In order that your knowledge of the details may be increasing, so that a mention of any given subject in the chapters that have been studied may present a complete picture to your mind, read the chapters carefully, at least once a week, noting, while doing so, the analysis. This will not be so great a task, in addition to the study of the advance lesson, as may at first be thought, and the results will more than pay for the time thus spent. You will find that, while indelibly fixing and increasing the knowledge that you already have, such a drill will enable you to learn the new lesson more easily. The faithful student will notice a marked difference in the time necessary to enable him to grasp the contents of a chapter now and when he began the book. This difference will be more and more marked as the study progresses. Do not allow yourself to become impatient at spending so much time on one portion of scripture. It is much more profitable to devote your time to one portion of Scripture, and have it for your own, than to read ten times as much in the same time and know but little about it when you are through. This study need not exclude your general reading of the Bible. It should not; and you will find that, the more faithfully you pursue this study, the more good will you derive from your other reading.
