### NOTES

1. "Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith." Heb. 10:22. The crowd thronged Jesus, yet the poor, afflicted woman, who could only get near enough to touch the hem of His garment, was really nearer to Him than anybody else in the whole company. It is faith that brings the soul near to God.

2. "Somebody hath touched Me; for I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me." Instead of "virtue," the Revised Version has "power," which is more forcible, and a more exact rendering. Christ is not only the wisdom of God, but He is the power of God. 1 Cor. 1:24. Faith lays hold on that power and appropriates it.

3. Many people think that faith is nothing but imagination. If that were all, why didn't it avail to heal the woman when she was being treated by the physicians? She showed her confidence in their skill by spending all her living upon them. Imagination, if properly acted upon, will cure an imaginary disease; but imagination cannot give back life that is actually departing, as it was from that woman. Moreover, Christ Himself perceived that something had gone from Him. It was not imagination that healed the woman; it was faith, and "faith is the substance of things hoped for."

4. What was it that went from Christ to the afflicted woman? It was just the thing that she stood in need of, and that was life. "The blood is the life," and that was what she was losing. As soon as she touched Jesus, "immediately her issue of blood stanched." She was made whole. Life from Jesus had followed that touch of faith, and filled her. This also was written "that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His name." John 20:31. Christ "is our life." Col. 3:4. He came to give life, not simply physical life, but spiritual life. This life is as real as the life He imparted to the woman, and is obtained in the same way. "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me." Gal. 2:20. In this lesson we have a practical example of the reality of the work of faith.

5. Christ is the "firstborn from the dead." Col. 1:18. And yet many were raised from the dead before His crucifixion and resurrection. Nevertheless, it is true that there is no resurrection of the dead except through the resurrection of Christ. 1 Cor. 15:17, 18. He is "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." Rev. 13:8. Then He must also be the Lamb raised from the dead from the foundation of the world. That this is the case He Himself showed in the words, "I am the resurrection and the life." John 11:25. So in all things He has the preeminence. There is no life but from Him.

6. In this lesson we have illustrated the pitying tenderness of Jesus. Let us not forget that in all this He was representing God to men. It was God's life and character that He was living. From this we see that God "delighteth in mercy." Micah 7:18. It is He that is "touched with the feeling of our infirmities." He does not like to see sorrow and suffering, and so He gives His own perfect life for their removal. Who cannot fully trust that such a God will give him the very best things that the universe contains?

7. "He called His twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils." This power was not given to the twelve alone, but to the seventy as well. Luke 10:17. Neither did it cease with them, for He promised it even to the end of the world. Matt. 28:18-20. And yet people mourn over the great power of Satan, and often make it an excuse for their failures. What matters it how strong Satan may be, or how numerous a host he may lead, since Christ has given His followers power over all devils? Mark, it is not simply power over one devil, but "over all devils." All the devils combined are not a match for the weakest soul who through faith is armed with the life of Christ. He has "spoiled principalities and powers." In chapter eight we saw what power Christ had over a legion of devils. To man He has given the power so to resist Satan that he will flee in dismay, but only as man continues "steadfast in the faith."
