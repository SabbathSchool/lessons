### NOTES

1. BY usurpation and fraud Satan had established his kingdom in the earth. Christ came to win back the dominion which had been betrayed by man into the hands of Satan, and to reestablish His own authority over those who would willingly yield allegiance to Him. So He preached concerning His kingdom from the first (Mark 1:14, 15), of His ministry until His ascension (Acts 1:3); but He found great difficulty in freeing His disciples' minds from the idea that His kingdom was a temporal one, and in impressing them with the belief that the kingdom which He came to establish would be a greater boon to them than to be delivered from the rule of the Roman power. The miracle of the loaves had made a deep impression upon the minds of the people. "His teachings and work of healing had already nearly convinced them of His divinity, and this miracle crowned their growing conviction with entire belief... They quietly consult among themselves, and arrange to take Him by force, and bear Him upon their shoulders, proclaiming Him the king of Israel... This, to the faithful followers of Jesus, seemed the golden opportunity to establish their beloved Master as Israel's king." But this is entirely out of harmony with the work which Jesus came to accomplish, and so He sent away His disciples, and then dismissed the multitude. "There were men of strong minds and firm determination in that throng, but the kingly bearing of Jesus, and His few quiet words of authority, quelled the tumult in a moment and frustrated all their designs."

2. FROM another record (Mark 6:46) we learn that Jesus went into the mountain to pray. "He needs that communion with the Father which is His very soul's life, and the more so that the hatred of the priestly party and the enthusiastic but unspiritual admiration of the Galileans are more and more complicating His position and embarrassing His work." "Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs and weaknesses, in that He became a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father fresh supplies of strength, that He might come forth braced for duty and trial... His humanity made prayer a necessity and a privilege. He found comfort and joy in communion with His Father. And if the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of fervent, constant prayer... The life must be like Christ's life, — between the mountain and the multitude."

3. "HE could not maintain the heavenly life in His soul without continually separating Himself from man, and communing with His Father... What a lesson for every Christian!... Nothing can atone for the loss of secret and direct intercourse with God... The law of the heavenly manna, that what is heavenly cannot remain good long upon earth, but must day by day be renewed afresh from heaven, still holds good... It is from Heaven alone that the power to lead a heavenly life on earth can come... Christlike praying in secret will be the secret of Christlike living in public."

4. THE narrative in verses 16-21 is a perfect picture of the experience of those who are trying to get along without Jesus. There was no lack of effort. They were "toiling in rowing," but the fourth watch found them only "five and twenty or thirty furlongs" from their starting-place. But when they had received Jesus, they "immediately" reached their destination.

5. WHEN the people had come across the sea and found Jesus, "they began to inquire how and when He had crossed the sea. They were astonished when the disciples related to them the events of the preceding night. The fury of the storm, and the many hours of fruitless rowing against the fury of adverse winds, the appearance of Christ walking upon the water, the fears thus aroused, His reassuring words, the adventure of Peter and its result, with the sudden stilling of the tempest and landing of the boat, were all faithfully recounted to the wondering crowd, amid frequent interruptions and exclamations of amazement... As soon as the discourse was ended, they gathered around the Saviour, questioning Him, hoping to receive from His own lips a fuller account of His mighty work of the previous night... Jesus declared to them that they did not seek Him from any worthy motive. He bade them not to labor for the meat which perishes, but to seek for spiritual food, that wisdom which endures unto everlasting life."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. IT was on a mountain that Christ gave the law, delivered His longest sermon, was transfigured, ascended to heaven. Note other important events which have occurred upon mountains. What lessons have been connected with mountains as used in comparisons?

2. It is no new thing for Christ to control the winds. As God's agent He had done it at the Red Sea (Ex. 14:21; 15:10), and the stormy wind fulfils His word (Ps. 148:8).

3. In connection with the sealing of Christ by the Father, study Lev. 2:4 (the meat offering anointed) and Heb. 1:9.

4. Observe the displays of royal power and authority by One who would not allow Himself to be made king.

5. In what way is life through Christ again taught in this lesson?
