### NOTES

1. "THE words of Jesus found a place in many hearts, and, like seed sown in goodly soil, they afterward bore abundant harvests. The spies scattered throughout the throng now report to the chief priests and elders that Jesus is gaining great influence among the people, and that many are already acknowledging their belief in Him. The priests therefore secretly lay their plans to arrest Jesus; but they arrange to take Him when He is alone; for they dare not risk the effect upon the people of seizing Him while in their presence." Jesus understood their purposes, and replied to them in verses 33, 34. "Soon the Saviour of the world will find a refuge from the persecution of His enemies, where their scorn and hate will be powerless to harm Him. He will ascend to His Father, to be again the Adored of angels; and thither His murderers can never come." Believers have no difficulty in finding Christ (Matt. 7:7), and they will soon go to meet Him (1 Thess. 4:17), but the world sees Him no more (John 14:19).

2. "THE condition of the people made this appeal very forcible. They had been engaged in a continued scene of pomp and festivity, their eyes had been dazzled with light and color, and their ears regaled with the richest music; but there had been nothing to meet the wants of the spirit, nothing to satisfy the thirst of the soul for that which perishes not. Jesus invited them to come and drink of the fountain of life, of that which should be in them a well of water springing up into everlasting life... The words of the divine Teacher presented the gospel in a most impressive figure... Jesus knew the wants of the human soul... Many of those who heard Jesus were mourners over disappointed hopes, some were nourishing a secret grief, some were seeking to satisfy the restless longing of the soul with the things of this world and the praise of men; but when all this was gained, they found that they had toiled to reach only a broken cistern, from which they could not quench their fever thirst... That sudden cry, 'If any man thirst,' startles them from their sorrowful meditation, and as they listen to the words that follow, their minds kindle with a new hope... The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth. It appeals to us with even greater power than to those who heard it in the temple on that last day of the feast. The weary and exhausted ones are offered the refreshing draught of eternal life... All who come to Christ receive His love in their hearts, which is the water that springs up into everlasting life. Those who receive it impart it in turn to others, in good works, in right examples, in Christian counsel."

3. "THE church has long been content with little of the blessing of God. They have not felt the need of reaching up to the exalted privileges purchased for them at infinite cost. Their spiritual strength has been feeble, their experience is of a dwarfed and crippled character, and they are disqualified for the work the Lord would have them do. They are not able to present the great and glorious truths of God's holy word, that would convict and convert souls through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The power of God awaits their demand and reception."

4. THE people are believing on Jesus as the Christ, the officers are softened by the power of His teaching, and Nicodemus speaks in His behalf before the Sanhedrin. The Pharisees are furious, but their rage is held in check. "They were startled and chagrined that one of their own number had been so impressed by the power of Jesus as to openly defend Him in the council." "Note their bitterness towards their servants, who had presumed to think for themselves; towards the multitude, who were cursed; towards Nicodemus." How characteristic it is of opposers of the truth to resort to sarcasm and ridicule when arguments fail! Thus did the Pharisees.

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. How did it happen that the Pharisees had "officers" of the law at their command? To what extent were they permitted to exercise civil authority? What law did they administer?

2. What daily ceremony of the Feast of Tabernacles would suggest the figure used by Jesus in verses 37 and 38?

3. By what experience is Jesus glorified? How is He glorified by us? 1 Peter 4:12-14.

4. Upon what foundation does Christ rest the promise made in verse 38?

5. How many among the Jews were supposed to know the law? What was included by them in "the law"?

6. The Pharisees had already judged Jesus without a hearing, but the law requires a hearing before it judges. The Pharisees are justifying both of the charges made against them by Jesus. Verse 19.

7. How is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?
