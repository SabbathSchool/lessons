### NOTE

"The ritual of the covenant itself is that which was frequently applied among most of the ancient nations, the Greeks and Romans, the Chaldeans and Macedonians. The sacrificial animal was divided into two halves, between which the contracting parties passed, thereby intimating that they would deserve to be so killed if they ventured to violate the agreement. But as, in fact, the act here described was not strictly a covenant, but a sign or promise on the part of God, only given under the form of a covenant, God only passed through the dissected parts in the shape of clouds, smoke, and fire; Abraham was a passive spectator, and the very beginning of the ceremony points to this feature; for God commanded Abraham, 'Take for Me a heifer,' etc. Wherever a real covenant was intended, it was customary among the Hebrews also that both parties should go between the divided animal. Jer. 34:18, 19. And on one particularly solemn occasion, when a perpetual alliance between God and Israel was ratified, the blood of the sacrifices was partly sprinkled on the altar, which represents God, and partly upon the people. Ex. 24:8.

"A young heifer, a she goat, and a ram, each of three years old, were wont to be divided in the ceremony of human engagements between contracting parties, and the pieces set far enough apart to let these pass between them, as if to call down on themselves the fate of the victims, if they broke the covenant thus ratified."â€”Geikie's Hours with the Bible, vol. 1, p.
