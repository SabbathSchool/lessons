### NOTES

1. "When He [God] came to crown His glorious work, to place one in the midst to stand as ruler of the fair earth, He did not fail to create a being worthy of the hand that gave him life. . . . He was placed, as God's representative, over the lower orders of beings. They cannot understand or acknowledge the sovereignty of God, yet they were made capable of loving and serving man."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 48.

2. "While they remained true to God, Adam and his companion were to bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control was given them over every living thing. The lion and the lamb sported peacefully around them, or lay down together at their feet. The happy birds flitted about them without fear; and as their songs ascended to the praise of their Creator, Adam and Eve united with them in thanksgiving to the Father and the Son."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 50.

3. "In order to possess an endless existence, man must continue to partake of the tree of life. Deprived of this, his vitality would gradually diminish till life would become extinct. . . . But after man's fall, holy angels were immediately commissioned to guard the tree of life. . . . None of the family of Adam were permitted to pass that barrier to partake of the life-giving fruit; hence there is not an immortal sinner."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 60.
