### NOTES

1. The "image of God" signifies more than a physical image. It includes man's capacity for understanding God and His works, also the power for ruling the dominion (Gen. 1:26-31), and a condition for uprightness (Eccl. 7:29). God made man in His likeness (Gen. 5:1), in His image (Gen. 9:6) and glory (1 Cor. 11:7).

2. By sin, man came short of the glory of God, thus losing his power to understand the things of God (1 Cor. 2:14), to have dominion (Heb. 2:8), and the power to do right (Rom. 3:9-11). In order for him to again occupy the position for which he was created, he must be recreated (John 3:3), with the desire and power to live the life of God, and be restored to the image of God (Col. 3:10).

3. Adam, "the first man, became a living soul. . . The first man was of the dust from the earth." 1 Cor. 15:45, 47, Syriac translation. "There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body." 1 Cor. 15:44. The Greek words may be literally rendered: "There is a soulical body, or soul body, and there is a spirit body." "And so it is written, The first man Adam was made [became] a living soul." Verses 44, 45. The first man, etc. (verse 47), i.e., the first man just declared a living, or a live, soul (verse 45), "is of the earth earthy."

4. Man was created with a capacity for an endless life, which was assured to him on the condition of perfect obedience. He was made a little lower than the angels (Ps. 8:4, 5), yet he was crowned as the ruler of the earth. Verses 6-8. By a law of his existence, righteousness is the essential thing to endless existence. Matt. 4:4. Life in all its manifestations is necessarily active. It cannot be inert. In its nature, it is ever the same, and different only in its manifestations. Eccl. 3:19. All living persons or things have just such a portion of it as is needful for their designed purpose or position. But the source of all life is Christ, who is the Living One. He originates and sustains life in all by giving it out of Himself. Acts 17:25; John 5:26.
