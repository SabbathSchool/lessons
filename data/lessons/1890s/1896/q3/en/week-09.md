### NOTES

1. WHEN the Saviour's presence is really desired, and He is "besought" to abide with us, He does so. See Luke 24:29. The woman brought her neighbors and friends to Christ with the inquiry, "Is not this the Christ?" and after hearing Him for themselves, they "believed because of His own word," and their belief went beyond hers, just as Nathanael's belief went beyond Philip's. "Before, they had looked upon Him as the great Teacher, the Solver of problems, the Answerer of questions. Now they see that he is the 'Saviour of the world.'" "Come into the very presence of Christ and hear Him for yourselves... Such spiritual contact is the life of the Christian life."

2. THE Samaritans believed, and then they knew. "Faith is simply the heart's reception of the words of Christ. Belief of the truth is the knowledge of the truth."

3. "THE father thought the presence of Christ was necessary... Jesus therefore demands a stronger faith; and in His presence that stronger faith which can trust His word is developed... The faith He approves and delights in is a faith which does not require miracles as its foundation... There was that in Himself and in His talk which was its own best evidence." See chapter 20:29.

4. THE words of Christ to the ruler consist of a command ("Go thy way"), and a statement of fact ("Thy son liveth"). The ruler permitted the command to become true in him (he went his way), and the servants met him with the testimony that the statement had become true in his son, repeating the very words of Jesus ("Thy son liveth"). By comparing notes they find that the experience and the statement were synchronous.

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. THE miracle of this scripture is the third lesson of "life only in Christ," and the means of apprehending it. To Nicodemus it is the new birth, and "whosoever believeth in Him should... have everlasting life." To the woman of Samaria it is "living water, springing up unto everlasting life." To the ruler it is, "Thy son liveth," and he "believed the word." What classes are here represented? To which one do you belong?

2. See in this lesson two illustrations of the faith which pleases the Master: "Many more believed because of His own word," and "the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken." See Rom. 10:17.

3. Are signs and wonders a safe basis for faith?
