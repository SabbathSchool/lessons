### NOTES

1. JOHN'S work made a great stir (Mark 1:4, 5), and a general belief that it was time for the Messiah led to a spirit of inquiry concerning this man of the wilderness (Luke 3:15). The excitement became so great that even the Sanhedrin sent an official deputation to John, which asked him, "Who art thou?" In the dialogue which follows John makes a formal proclamation that the Messiah had come, and was indeed present among them, but unknown by every one except John himself. The literal basis of the figurative reply of John may be found in "the practice of eastern monarchs, who, whenever they entered upon an expedition or took a journey, especially through desert countries, sent harbingers before them to prepare all things for their passage, and pioneers to open the passes, to level the ways, and to remove all impediments."

2. "THE rabbis said, 'Every office which a servant will do for his master a scholar should perform for his teacher, except loosing his sandal thong.' But this exceptionally menial office the Baptist declares he was not worthy to perform for Jesus."

3. SACRIFICIAL offerings of animals could not avail (Heb. 10:4), but the death of Christ met every demand for all time (Heb. 9:15) and for the whole world (1 John 2:2). "When, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, John had pointed to Jesus as the Lamb of God, a new light was shed upon the Saviour's mission."

4. "IN the throng gathered at the Jordan there were many who had been present at the baptism of Jesus, but the sign then given had been manifest to but few among them. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. Eyes that had never been turned in faith to Him that is invisible, beheld not the revelation of the glory of God, nor heard the voice from heaven. So it is now. Often the presence of Christ and of the ministering angels is manifest in the assemblies of the people, and yet there are many who know it not. They discern nothing unusual. But to some the Saviour's presence is revealed."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. CAREFULLY observe the leading thoughts in the teaching of John. The blood of the Lamb, and the baptism of the Spirit, were the two central truths of his creed and his preaching. Jesus the Lamb taking away sin, Jesus the Anointed baptizing with the Spirit.

2. Three names are given in this lesson for Christ: The Lamb of God, the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, and the Son of God.

3. Note the new names introduced in this lesson: The Jews (Pharisees), Elias, Isaiah, and Israel. The new places: Jerusalem, and Bethabara (or Bethany, see R. V.).

4. Observe the humility of John in his estimate of Christ (verses 15, 27, and 30), and then read Christ's estimate of John in Luke 7:28.

5. Consider that the Spirit not only descended upon Christ, but that it abode upon Him.
