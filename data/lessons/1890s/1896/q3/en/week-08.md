### NOTES

1. WHEN thus pressed with her own need of forgiveness and cleansing, how much of human nature is shown in the effort to turn the conversation. "Like this woman, we start some old worn-out theological controversy, to put Him off the scent. There are plenty of people who spend their lives in theological disputes and refinements, because in this way they dexterously manage to pass muster as religious people; though, all the while, they dread anything like definite appeals to their hearts." "How often the same course is pursued! When the Holy Spirit is impressing the heart, when God is seeking to awaken His church to a new life, men turn aside, parrying the arrows of conviction, neglecting that which concerns the salvation of the soul, to dispute over some controverted point of doctrine."

2. IN saying, "Ye worship that which ye know not" (R. V.), "Jesus also alluded to the faith of the Samaritans being amalgamated with the worship of graven images. True, they held that these idols were only to remind them of the living God, the Ruler of the universe; but, nevertheless, the people were led to reverence these inanimate figures." This is the philosophy and the result of all idolatry.

3. "THAT which Jesus had withheld from the Jews and enjoined upon His disciples to keep secret, was distinctly opened before the inquiring woman of Samaria; for He who knew all things perceived that she would make a right use of her knowledge, and be the means of leading others to the true faith." "Wherever there are hearts open to receive the truth, Christ has glad tidings for them. For such He uses no parables. He seeks not to disguise Himself. He says to them, as to the woman of Samaria, 'I that speak unto thee am He.'"

4. THE disciples supposed that they had two good reasons for marveling: first, because Jesus was talking with a Samaritan (Acts 10:28); second, because He was talking with "a woman" (R. V.). "A rabbinical prejudice prevailed, to the effect that woman is not capable of profound religious instruction." The woman's invitation is that of Christ to His first disciples (chapter 1:39), and of Philip to Nathanael (chapter 1:46).

5. "THE disciples were good men, but they went into Sychar judging the Samaritans good enough to trade with, but never dreaming of telling them that the Messiah was outside their town. They must have been ashamed to find how much more capable an apostle the woman was than they."

6. "THE disciples did not seem to appreciate the character of the food which Jesus had to eat (verse 33) any better than the woman understood concerning the living water (verse 11). "It was not temporal food alone that sustained Him in His arduous life; the accomplishment of the work which He left the courts of heaven to perform strengthened Him for His labors, and lifted Him above the necessities of humanity. To administer to a soul hungering and thirsting for the truth was more satisfying to the Son of man than eating or drinking. Benevolence was the life of His soul."

### SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

1. NOTE the new term by which Christ refers to God as "the Father." What is the force of this title?

2. What is the significance of using "we" in verse 22?

3. The woman related her personal experience with Christ as a means of drawing the people of the city to hear Him. Compare this with Paul's method of defending himself before Agrippa.

4. Make a careful study of Jesus as one doing the will of God. "Jesus Christ became man to bring us back to the blessedness of doing God's will."

5. What special force does the instruction of verse 35 have at the present time? What harvest is nearly ripe?

6. Note the frequent recurrence of teaching which pertains to "life eternal."
