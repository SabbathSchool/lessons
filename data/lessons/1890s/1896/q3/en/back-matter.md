# BIBLES AND BOOKS OF REFERENCE

## REVISED BIBLES.—Cheap Editions.

As many Bible students use a Revised Bible for reference merely, and therefore do not care for an expensive binding, we wish to refer you to the following list of Revised Bibles, Oxford Edition:

## REVISED NEW TESTAMENTS.

We carry a very nice Revised New Testament—Harper's Edition—bound in dark cloth, back title in gold, well printed on good paper and in large, clear type, which originally sold at 50c, but which we will send postpaid for 25c net.

## STRONG'S CONCORDANCE.

A book at once simple and deeply profound; a book that a child may understand, so easily grasped are its fundamental rules and ideas, and which the ripest scholar may ponder, so extensive are its researches. Prices $6.00, $8.00 and $10.00. Send for a descriptive catalog.

## WALKER'S CONCORDANCE.

A Text Finder, and a good one. The word you want is printed in bold type and is easily found. Fifty thousand more references than Cruden. Cloth, $2.00.
