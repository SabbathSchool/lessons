"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." Deut. 6:6, 7.

## PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS

**SABBATH**—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, recalling Scripture words and references. Read the lesson for the intermediate division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.

**SUNDAY**—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:
1. Assign a reference to each member of the family, using the lesson pamphlet to ascertain what references are used in the lesson.
2. Then read the texts in their regular order, carefully considering what each one says before reading the next one. Be sure to have each member of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each text.
3. Select two texts to be committed to memory through the day.
4. Repeat the memory verse.

**MONDAY**—Review the portion of the lesson already studied.
1. Have each one name as many references as he can.
2. Give each one an opportunity to repeat the two texts that were to be committed to memory on the previous day.
3. Assign each one a text found in the first half of the lesson, and let one member of the family ask the questions from the lesson pamphlet, and the others in turn read the answers given in the texts or in the LESSON QUARTERLY.

Then study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the first half was studied on Sunday.

**TUESDAY**—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and ask the questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand the questions and the meaning of the words used in them.

Select two texts to be committed to memory during the day.

**WEDNESDAY**—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and review the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY, the Instructor, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. The number and age of the children would usually indicate which lesson help would be the best.

**THURSDAY**—Read the lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in the Sabbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and review the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the LESSON QUARTERLY. Repeat the texts committed to memory.

**FRIDAY**—Thoroughly review the entire lesson in the following manner:
1. Ask the questions as found in the LESSON QUARTERLY.
2. Call upon different ones to give a synopsis of the lesson or the lesson story in their own language.
3. Have the references given by different ones, and have those texts repeated that have been committed to memory.
4. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson.

**SABBATH**—Review practical truths of the lesson, repeat all the texts committed to memory, and relate personal experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been found helpful.

(This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of thorough, regular, systematic study of the Scriptures as given in our Sabbath school lessons.)

# GOSPEL BY JOHN

FOR SENIOR CLASSES                   3d QUARTER, 1896

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

THE object of studying the Gospel of John is to learn what the Holy Spirit has revealed in this particular book concerning the person, work, and teaching of Jesus Christ. The true method of studying the Gospels is first to study each one independently of any other, in order to become familiar with the characteristic teaching of each, after which they may be profitably compared. For this reason the principal effort should be to obtain a clear knowledge of each thought as presented by the text of the lesson rather than to divert the mind to the development of the thought in other places. There is no better way to express the thoughts presented in the Scriptures than in the very words of the Scriptures, and teachers are therefore urged to require that the answers to the questions shall be given in the exact words of the text. The effort of the student should be directed to obtaining a complete mastery of each lesson, not by attempting to commit the words to memory, but by so studying the thoughts that they shall become a part of his mental make-up; and he will then find that the easiest way to express the thoughts will be in the exact words of the text.

There is constant danger of being diverted from the study of God's thought, as expressed to us in His word, to the study of what some man has thought about God's thought. The very object of Bible study is to be brought into direct communion with the divine mind, that we may learn from God Himself what He has condescended to reveal to us in language; but this object is defeated when we allow another mind to interpose between us and God's thought. The Scripture is God's thought incarnate, so to speak, put into human speech, in order that His mind may be brought into direct contact with our minds, His thought with our thought. But just as soon as we put man's thought between us and God's thought, and try to let God's thought in through some man's thought, we shut off our minds from a direct contact with the divine mind. Thus the special blessing of real Bible study is lost. The ideal Bible student is not the one who can tell the most about the Bible, but the one who has stored his mind with the precious thoughts of God, and is able to express them readily in the very words in which God has expressed them.

This method of study makes it possible that "they shall be all taught of God;" for it is when we consider what He says, as He says it, that He can give us understanding, and the Holy Spirit is appointed to this very work.

Those who are skeptical as to this method of Bible study, are urged to give it a fair trial in the study of this Book. Do not consider any lesson properly prepared until any question which will admit of being answered in the words of the text set apart for the lesson, can be readily answered in the exact words of the text without looking at the printed text. This can not be accomplished by a hasty reading of the lesson a short time before the Sabbath school. Make it a subject of much meditation and the topic of conversation "when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." Do not argue with any one as to the meaning of any passage, but be sure that you know exactly what God has said, and then seek the understanding from Him who has promised wisdom to those who ask Him for it. Those who follow this plan faithfully will not only acquire a mastery of what is revealed in the Book of John, but will also gain an experience in study which will enable them to take up any other Book in the same way for themselves, and thus to become Bible students indeed.

Use the notes and suggestions only as a means of studying the text itself, and do not allow the mind to be diverted by them from the study of the text. Otherwise they are a hindrance instead of a help.

Teachers are urged to make a personal application of the lessons both to themselves and to their classes. We are not to study this book as a record of past events simply, but as living and speaking to us now. We are to see revealed in it a living Saviour, the Bearer of life and light and love to us; and as we receive the truth as it is in Jesus, we are to experience its saving power in our daily lives.

After each chapter has been studied, encourage each member of the class to express in few words the leading thoughts of the chapter, and by frequent reviews fix these topics in mind. If parents would do this for themselves, and then help their children to do it, making it—instead of the gossip of the day—a common subject of conversation in the homes, much good might be accomplished. A genuine and lasting interest in Bible study may thus be developed.
