# THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE
## BY ELDER A. T. JONES

Contains one of the clearest and most concise presentations of the great subject of religious liberty that we have yet issued. Only a bare outline of the book is enough to convince one of its value.

It is written with a view to uniting conciseness with clear and comprehensive treatment, and contains just those things which we need and about which we ought to be thoroughly informed.

"THE THREEFOLD MESSAGE OF REV. 14" is the subject of the Sabbath school lessons for this quarter, and "The Rights of the People" is recommended as a valuable companion volume to aid in the study of the lessons.

A number of well-selected illustrations give an added interest to the volume.

The book contains fifteen chapters, and is one of permanent value for reference and study. It contains 384 pages, is issued as No. 32 of the Religious Liberty Library, and is furnished in neat paper covers at 40 cents.

A finer edition on laid paper and neatly bound in cloth, is also ready. Price, one dollar. See address below.

# THE LORD'S DAY
## THE TEST OF THE AGES
### BY ELDER M. C. WILCOX

This is the most powerful, convincing and convicting argument on the great question of the Sabbath we have seen. The arguments brought forth are unanswerable, and still are not calculated to arouse prejudice.

The historical extracts used are brief and to the point, while the contrasts, diagrams, and illustrations are at once simple and comprehensive. The great question of the Sabbath is treated in a reverential and original manner, that is truly pleasing and instructive. In connection with the study of the messages this most excellent treatise on the Sabbath will be most valuable.

Just the book to put into the hands of lawyers, editors and statesmen.
