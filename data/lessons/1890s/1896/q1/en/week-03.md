## NOTE

TO BE A SIGN.—The Sabbath is not a mere memorial of a past event. It is well to remember God and all His wondrous works, and of these His Sabbath is a remembrancer. But what He was for His people then in the creation of the world, He is to them now in recreating, upholding, preserving. The power of the word which He spoke during the six days of creation is still manifest in upholding and perpetuating the things He has made. It is manifest in the re-creation of souls born into the kingdom of God. The Lord is a very present help in trouble, and the Sabbath is to us the sign of His almighty present power in and for us.
