### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 5 - There are always features in every parable which will not fit the case to which the parable in general applies, for it is impossible that any material thing should perfectly represent the spiritual. It is not best, therefore, to spend the time in trying to make every detail fit somewhere. We have the chief characters and features in the householder, his vineyard, which he let to husbandmen, his servants, and his son. There are certain other features which are also fitting. The tower which was built in the vineyard doubtless applies to the temple; the hedge round about it, to the holy laws, rites, and ceremonies which separated Israel from the world; the place for the wine-fat is evidently Jerusalem. But here it is well to pause. The going into the far country and the receiving of fruit at a specified time are consistent with the parable, but they are not designed to have any special application, further than this, that God looked for his people to bring forth fruits all the way along. A parable is not designed to apply in every particular. The great practical lesson should be the thing which we should seek to understand, not the detail of the parable.

2. QUESTION 13 - It seems by comparing the different accounts, that Jesus first asked the question, "What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do?" The people, carried along by the manner and eloquence of Jesus, and not realizing the application of the parable, are constrained to reply: "He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons." Jesus then repeats the solemn sentence which the Jews, in their sense of justice, had pronounced: "He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others." They see then its application and its force, and reply, "Let it not be;" they would have it otherwise. This must not come upon the holy nation. This protest Jesus meets by quoting from their own Scriptures. Luke brings this out with peculiar force. Jesus paused, looked upon them, and said, "What is this then that is written?" Luke 20:17. "Have ye not read this scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?'" It is only as we combine the accounts of the evangelists, many times, that we get the full force and beauty of Christ's teaching.
