### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 4 - Moses and Elias (Elijah) were talking with Jesus. Luke tells us what they were talking about. They conversed with our Lord of his sufferings, sympathizing with and comforting him in view of the trial which awaited him, and cheering him with the assurance of certain triumph over sin and death. Jesus designed all this to be a support to the disciples as they came to that trying hour. This manifestation of glory came in answer to the earnest prayers of Jesus.

2. QUESTION 6 - Peter not only knew "not what to say," but he understood not what he said. He evidently thought that the heavenly guests would abide with them. He understood not the nature of the kingdom.

3. QUESTION 11 - The evident reason for thus charging the disciples was that no other evidences of his divinity should be brought to bear upon the people but what was manifest before all. The apostles, not understanding the nature of Christ's kingdom, would be certain to give it a wrong interpretation, and thus they would spread error rather than truth. They were to wait till the Scripture was opened unto them. Luke 24:45.

4. QUESTION 14 - There will be two classes of subjects gathered home to the kingdom of Christ when he comes. The first will be those who are raised from the dead. Moses was a type of this class, and was raised as a pledge of the resurrection. This is indicated not only by the design of the vision, but by Jude 9. In a dispute over the body of the servant of God between Christ (Michael) and Satan there could be but one resultâ€”the Son of God would be victorious. The second class will be those translated without seeing death, represented by Elijah, who was thus taken to heaven. 2 Kings 2:11.
