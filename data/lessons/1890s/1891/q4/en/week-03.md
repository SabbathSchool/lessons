### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 1 - Between the events of this lesson and our last comes in what is recorded in chapters 10 to 18:14 in Luke and chapters 7 to 10 in John.

2. QUESTION 10 - God only is absolute good; if, therefore, Jesus was good of himself, he was of God and divine. The young man's address was doubtless only designed to be respectful; Jesus used it to convey a lesson which would be of eternal worth if studied.

3. QUESTION 15 - The young man had kept the law, doubtless, as did Paul. He had observed it outwardly, not realizing that the principles of love on which it was based demanded his all. His wealth was his god, his morality was his pride, and he knew it not. He was really a transgressor of the first commandment, and therefore of the whole law, for it is one law. The law demands all-absorbing love, and love gives all.

4. QUESTION 20 - The words of Jesus show the great danger and powerful snare of riches. Of course, it is only by the power of God that any can be saved, but it would require more of God's power to enable the rich man to relinquish his idol, or break the cords that bind him to the world in so many ways. The proverb concerning the camel and the eye of a needle was a common proverb among the orientals to denote an impossibility. For "they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition." 1 Tim. 6:9. To those whose heart is set on riches there is no way to escape its snares. The only hope of the rich is to yield all to God. They are then no longer rich in this world's goods but poor for Christ's sake.
