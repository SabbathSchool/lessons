## THE LIFE AND WORDS OF CHRIST,

BY CUNNINGHAM GEIKIE, D. D.

We have quite a stock of the above book on hand, and they will be especially useful to those who are now studying the Sabbath-school lessons on the Gospel of Mark.

As to the plan of the work, we quote from the author's preface:â€”

"I have tried in this book to restore, as far as I could, the world in which Jesus moved; the country in which he lived; the people among whom he grew up and ministered; the religion in which he was trained; ... the events, social, religious, and political, not mentioned in the Gospels, that formed the history of his lifetime, so far as they can be recovered.

"In this picture, he, himself, is, of course, the central figure, to which all details are subordinate. ... All his sayings and discourses are given in full, for a life in which he is not his own interpreter must be defective.

"No one can feel more keenly than myself how open such a book must be to criticism. Where the best and wisest have differed, I could not expect that all will agree with me, and I cannot hope to have escaped oversights, or even errors, in treating a subject so extensive. I can only plead my honest desire for truth and correctness, in mitigation of judgment."

This is a cheap edition of the "Life of Christ," but is quite well printed and bound in cloth. The book contains 826 pages, and will be sent postpaid for 50 cents.
