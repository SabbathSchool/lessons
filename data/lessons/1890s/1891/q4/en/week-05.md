### NOTES ON THE LESSON

1. QUESTION 1 - Intervening between this and the last lesson are the events and teaching of Luke 19:1-27 and John 12:1-11. The parable of the pounds was given to correct the erroneous ideas in regard to the kingdom of Christ. Certainly the disciples could not say our Lord had deceived them.

2. QUESTION 3 - They looked not only for the kingdom of God to appear, but they recognized Christ as the King. There seemed also to be a general recognition of his earthly ancestry. See Matt. 9:27; 20:30; 15:22.

3. QUESTION 8 - The testimony of the people did not seem to be the strong conviction of faith; rather, it was pressed upon them by coming under the influence of the Spirit of God, just as Saul prophesied. See 1 Sam. 19:19-24. Abiding faith dwells only in regenerated, sanctified hearts.

4. QUESTION 15 - The barren fig tree was a fit representative of the Jewish nation and temple worship. Their gorgeous temple, elaborate ritual, and high profession, fitly accorded with the leaves of the fig tree, which do not appear till after the figs. That tree said by its leaves, "You will find fruit here." The Jews said to all surrounding them, "We are the people of God. Here you will find true worship." Jesus came to his vineyard but found no fruit (Luke 13:6-9), and his curse rested upon the cumberer of the ground. He came to his own, and his own received him not. John 1:11; Luke 19:14.
