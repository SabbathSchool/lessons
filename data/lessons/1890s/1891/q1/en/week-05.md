## NOTES

1. In verse 8 James calls those to whom he writes into the presence of a higher, a supreme law, before which all stand as equal. In its sight there are no rich or poor, high or low. Its inquiries respect only right and wrong, innocence and guilt. It is the "royal" law, because it is the law of the great King. Before this all must bow. In accordance with this, all petty difficulties must be settled, and our conduct one toward another be regulated. Thus the apostle fittingly reaches the climax of his argument.

2. The commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," is not taken from the decalogue, but is found in Lev. 19:18. Yet Christ sets this down as the second of the two great commandments in the law." Matt. 22:36-40. In answer to this question by a lawyer, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" Jesus answered: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." What is here called "the first and great commandment," is likewise not found in the decalogue, but in Deut. 6:5. From these facts some are disposed to argue that the ten commandments do not occupy the supreme position of "the law of God;" for if they did, they say, the Lord would have quoted them in answer to the lawyer's question; but as, instead, he quoted from the books of Moses, therefore they claim there is no distinction between the ten commandments and the law of Moses; and quotations from other parts of the Mosaic code are put before the ten commandments. But all such false reasoning is overturned by the way in which James here presents the subject. He says that we are to fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Then he shows what he means by the "royal law" by quoting two of the ten commandments. Thus he demonstrates the connection between that scripture and the decalogue by showing that that part of the decalogue which relates to our duties to our fellow-men, which contains the commandments, "Thou shalt not kill," and, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," is summed up in the command to love our neighbors as ourselves; and consequently the first table of the decalogue, that part which relates to our duty to God, is summed up in the command to love God with all the heart. What Christ said, therefore, to the lawyer was equivalent to quoting the whole decalogue, since he gave an epitome of both tables.

3. On James 2:10, J. P. Thompson, D. D., has the following pertinent note: "The law of God is not a string of precepts; it is a principle, a spirit, a unity. It encircles one like a ring of gold. If he steps over it at any point, he goes outside of it, and is a transgressor as really as though he should break it in pieces at every point. Indeed, one breaks this law by the spirit of pride, of envy, of jealousy; by any feeling which, if carried out into action, would do injury to a neighbor. Only the spirit of love pervading all our conduct can preserve intact the pure and holy law."—The Bible in the Home, p. 119

4. "Mercy rejoiceth [margin, "glorieth"] against judgment." James 2:10. Various constructions are put upon this passage; but that which seems to be the most obvious design of the declaration is to show how exceedingly precious a quality mercy is in the sight of heaven. He that shows no mercy will receive none. He who shows mercy will receive it. Matt. 5:7. And mercy rejoiceth against judgment, that is, it is a matter of rejoicing, one in which we may glory, and which redounds to the glory of God, that a plan has been devised whereby mercy can be consistently extended to those who are under condemnation and justly exposed to judgment. No principle of God's government has been sacrificed, no lowering of God's authority has been suffered, no indignity has been cast upon the law; and yet the sinner can be saved. Thus mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
