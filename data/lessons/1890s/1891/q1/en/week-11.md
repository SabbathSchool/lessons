5. What especially distinguishes the present generation with respect to riches, from all preceding generations?
6. In what condition will the treasures of the very rich be found at last? James 5:2.

8. What sin does Paul put second in the list of sins which will characterize the last days? 2 Tim. 3:2.
9. What is said of gold and silver which will witness against them who have hoarded them up?
10. Instead of these riches proving the source of pleasure anticipated, what did they become? Verse 3, next to last clause.
11. Of what is this heaping up of treasure a sign?—Ib. last clause.
12. What is the relation of these rich men to the laborer? Verse 4.
13. What present social condition reminds us of this prophecy? See note 2.

17. What other dangers do the Scriptures connect with the possession of riches? Deut. 8:13, 14; Neh. 9:25, 26; Prov. 18:23; Micah 6:12; Matt. 13:22; 19:23, 24; 1 Tim. 6:10.
18. What is meant by "a day of slaughter" in James 5:5, last clause? Ans.—A day when animals are slain and provided for a time of feasting; and it indicates that they give themselves up to indulge in every kind of riot and excess.
19. How do they at the same time treat the just? Verse 6.
20. What attitude do the latter class assume?—Ib.
21. In what way only could "the just" properly seek redress from oppression? Ans.—Not by violence, but by legal means.
22. What is the primary signification of the word here rendered "resist"? Ans.—It means "to set one's self in formal array against." It would, therefore, very properly apply to the attempt to maintain a cause against an antagonist in a court of justice. But in the present day a man who has nothing but justice on his side, does not stand much of a chance, when a large amount of capital is arrayed against him. They are wise, therefore, who do not attempt to "resist" even in this manner.

## NOTES

1. Verse 1.—None are more ready to take rose-colored views of the future than the rich. None are more pleased with the "peace and safety" cry of the last days. 1 Thess. 5:3. But "sudden destruction" is then impending. So while they are anticipating good days to come, and are saying in their hearts, "To-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant," this prophecy calls upon them to weep even unto howling for the calamities, judgments, and miseries of the great day of the Lord which are hanging over them, and from which their riches, in which they have so blindly trusted, will not deliver them. It is instructive to notice how often the rich are particularly mentioned in descriptions of the scenes of the day of the Lord.

2. Verse 4.—The hire of the laborers crieth. The condition of things at the present day in respect to the increase of riches, is a strange and startling one. There has never before been a time in the world's history when such fortunes could be accumulated, and in so short a time, as can be to-day. These could not have been accumulated without the great inventions of modern times; and these have appeared as one feature of the prophecy of Daniel that in the time of the end knowledge should be increased. Dan. 12:4. Thus a few persons acquiring immense fortunes can combine their capital, and hold the mass of the people entirely at their mercy in every commercial point of view. Until this state of things existed, the labor troubles which now so deeply stir society, were unknown. Hence it is what would be expected, that James, in predicting the phenomenal increase of riches, should also throw in some remarks indicating that such a state of things would cause trouble on the part of the laborers. It is certainly an unnatural and unhealthy state of things when a man without capital, but with an aptitude for what is called "business," can start in, and by a shrewd manipulation of circumstances, and in half a score of years, come out with ten or twenty millions, as many do nowadays while the toilers whose labor has created these millions which these men draw into their coffers, are on the downhill road of poverty, under more exacting conditions; for there is too much of truth in the current aphorism that "the rich are growing richer, and the poor are growing poorer." There is no wonder that the situation breeds trouble, and no doubt that it will continue to do so, till society breaks up in the great time of trouble that ushers in the day of the Lord.
