## NOTES

1. The word rendered "master" in verse 1 is by some here rendered "teacher"—be not many teachers—and thought to refer to an aggressive and offensive propagandism of religious views. One of the definitions of the word, to be sure, is "teacher;" but the lexicons make it, in the New Testament, the equivalent of "rabbi," so that Matt. 23:8 would apply to it; and if we give it the sense of "teacher," the subject and context would oblige us to understand it as meaning to dictate, or set up one's views as the standard, and try to oblige everyone else to conform to them. Such expose themselves to greater condemnation; for all are fallible and liable to mistakes. This is true even of prophets and apostles. See the cases of Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jonah, Paul, Peter, and Barnabas. Acts 21:26-28; Gal. 2:11-13. And when one enters upon a calling for which he is not fitted, and claims more than he is justly entitled to, he is the more censurable.

2. No work is more difficult than the proper government of the tongue. Useless, frivolous, idle, or injurious conversation is the bane of many lives. The danger of abuses of the tongue enters even into the domain of religion; and religious controversy is too apt to be characterized by sharp, bitter, and contentious words.

3. How large a proportion of unhappiness in the family, of trouble in society, and alienation and discord in the church, comes from a wrong use of the tongue! And how apt many are, even if they do not originate a slanderous report, to take it up and repeat it to others! So if we have not a slanderous tongue, we may have an ear for scandal; and this is a twin evil, for without this the occupation of the tattler and busybody in other men's matters would soon be gone.

4. In verses 6-8, James evidently has reference to the unregenerate tongue; for the grace of God can bring it into subjection. The grace of God can purify the heart, which is the great fountain out of which come thoughts, that blossom into words. But when the fountain is made right, that which comes from it will be right. So it is said that "a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good." Luke 6:45. The true remedy then against the evils which flow from the tongue is to have the heart subdued and made right in the sight of God.

5. Verse 9 would seem rather to apply to those who have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof, who have a form of lip service toward God, and while professing to honor God, the Creator or Father of all, yet denounce or curse their fellow-men, the creature, either for their lack of religion, or because they fancy they have the wrong religion. By the word "we," the apostle doubtless refers to a general condition among men, not including himself personally as guilty of the inconsistency of which he speaks. Just as it is often said that "we" do this or that, and take this or that course, when all that is meant is that people generally do so.
