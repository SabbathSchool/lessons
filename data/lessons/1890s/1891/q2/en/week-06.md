## NOTES

1. THE KINGDOM — The kingdom of God does not exist here. This earth will not be the kingdom of God till Christ shall come. Matt. 25:31. But the subjects of that kingdom are yet here. God is gathering them out. That work is the work of the kingdom of God, the work of the King on the throne of grace, and it is therefore called the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, etc.

2. THE OTHER SIDE — These parables were spoken, as all are agreed, in the vicinity of Capernaum. To the other side would, therefore, be to the east side of the Sea of Galilee, to the country of Gadara. Mark 5:1.

3. THE ALARMED DISCIPLES — In the appeal of the disciples to Christ, each of the evangelists uses different words. Probably all their expressions were used. The first, "Lord, save us; we perish" (Matthew) is the language of earnest appeal and alarm, but the Master sleeps on; then comes, "Master, carest thou not that we perish?" the language of impatience and reproachful entreaty; and finally the language of almost despair, "Master, Master, we perish!" How small their faith! They had accepted him as the Christ of God, and yet in times of severe danger their faith faltered and failed. But Jesus in his compassion gives them another evidence of his divine power; he shows them that—

"Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
No water shall swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean, or earth, or skies;
    They all shall sweetly obey My will,
    Peace, peace, be still."

It evidently was Satan's object to destroy Jesus by the fearful storm which he, as "prince of the power of the air," was permitted to bring. But he could not, neither can he, destroy one soul in whose heart Christ dwells. Death may come to the trusting Christian, but even in this he is "more than conqueror" through Christ. See Ps. 112:7.
