## NOTES

1. THE DEMONIAC — Matthew says that there were two men possessed with demons; Mark and Luke say one. There is no contradiction. One was doubtless more prominent than the other, and Mark and Luke mention this one.

2. THE TIME OF JUDGMENT — As the demoniac came into the presence of Christ, he seemed to realize that there was help for him, so he fell down before him in the attitude of worship. The demons within him also realized the power of Christ, and when their poor victim attempted to speak, they put their own words in his mouth, and plead for themselves that they might not be tormented before "the time" — the great day of God's executive judgment, which they know is sure to come. One demon seems to have been mouthpiece for all.

3. SWINE VERSUS SOULS — The Lord permitted the demons to possess the swine; in thus doing a human soul was set free. Satan's object was to destroy Christ, or, failing in that, his influence. The destruction of the swine did, for a time, affect the latter. But Christ left a living witness of his power to save. Before they knew Christ, the swine was more precious in their eyes than a redeemed soul. But the life of the restored demoniac brought the people to their senses, and led them to better appreciate the worth of the gospel of Christ.

4. CALLED TO SERVICE — It would certainly have been more pleasant for the restored man to have remained with Christ; but great blessings bring great obligations. As Christ had released him from the bondage of Satan, he became Christ's servant, and it was therefore his duty to do Christ's work. Jesus told him to "go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee." This he cheerfully did, and the result was that those who would not accept Jesus in person because they did not know him, listened with wonder as he was lifted up in the life and testimony of the restored demoniac. There is no testimony so powerful as that which comes from a heart which has been cleansed from sin by the power of Christ. Let us ever remember, as taught by this lesson, that Christ calls us and cleanses us for service.
