## NOTES

1. PARABLES — Our Lord often gave instructions in parables, for several reasons: 1. Such instruction would awaken inquiry, and lead the inquirer to the truth. 2. Lessons can many times be pressed home more forcibly in this way, without giving needless offense, than in any other manner. 3. Jesus could thus teach without hindrance many truths necessary at that time; whereas, if he had declared them in plain language, he would have been arrested by the Jews and his work would have been hindered.

2. HOW ARE WE DEVELOPED — The same sun that ripens the wheat for the harvest ripens the noxious plants for the burning. The same laws which prove life and safety to the obedient, prove destruction to the transgressor. Hosea 14:9. So with these truths spoken by Christ. To the willing-hearted, to the humble, to the meek, to those who were seeking them, they came as precious instruction; but to those who had closed their eyes and ears, to those whose heart had waxed gross through selfishness, these words of Christ would only the more deeply condemn because spoken in their hearing. Matt. 13:12 may be paraphrased to read thus: "For whosoever hath [obtained some grace and truth by seeking], to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly; but whosoever hath not [obtained the grace and light of God by earnestly seeking therefor], from him shall be taken away even that [which] he [now] hath."

3. THE SUPERFICIAL — Are the stony ground hearers necessary? — Not at all. The parable takes the soil as it finds it, — a class of people quite numerous. When it looks as though all would accept the truth, and it seems popular, they accept it with joy for the good they will get instead of the good they will do. They do not think or dig deep. They love what they hope the truth will bring them rather than what it will do for them if they will submit to it. They are prepared for sensuous ease, enjoyment, and blessing, but not for trial, hardship, and the greater, richer blessings and privileges which come by suffering for the truth's sake. Therefore, not being armed for this (1 Peter 4:1), when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the truth, they are offended — they stumble. See Revised Version. "Great peace have they which love thy law, and they have no stumbling-block." Ps. 119:165, margin.

4. THE DOUBLE MINDED — The thorny-ground hearers are a class who desire to retain the world and the truth both. They are not so numerous as the class before them; but there are many such in the churches. They did not think it worth while to root out the thorns. They wished the truth and they wished the world too. But the thorns grow more rapidly in their native soil than the good seed, so that whenever a plant of truth would spring up, it is choked by the thorns. "The cares of the world" by some, "the deceitfulness of riches" by others, "the pleasures of this life" by a third class, "the lusts of other things" in all, choke out the word, it becomes unfruitful, or if, perchance, a tree shoots up, and fruit starts on its branches, it does not come to perfection. Compare with Luke. In the above classes God wants the fallow ground broken up, the stones gathered out, the thorns uprooted. Let the heart be broken before God, let it be cleansed by the blood of Christ, and then let the honest and good heart receive the good seed, and the fruit will be unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
