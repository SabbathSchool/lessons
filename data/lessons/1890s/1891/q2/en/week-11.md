## NOTE

THEY WERE OFFENDED — "Caused to stumble" (Revised Version, margin). Reproof either leads to repentance or to rebellion. The object in giving it should always be to help the individual if possible; but whatever the object or motive in the one who gives it, we should always receive it with humility of heart. If we have done wrong, let there be hearty repentance and gratitude to God that he has thought us worthy of reproof. If we are innocent, we have cause of gratitude that he has kept us. In either case we should not be offended at the one who gives the reproof. If we are guilty, we deserve it. If it is given unjustly, the one who gave it should be pitied rather than hated. No power outside of our own heart can make us stumble. (See note to lesson 9.) "Great peace have they that love thy law, and they shall have no stumbling-block." Ps. 119:165, margin. All wrong feelings or motives cherished in the heart, all institutions of error in existence, will sometime be rooted up. If we put them away and renounce them, we will escape the destruction; but if we identify ourselves with them, we will, as a part of the evil, be rooted up with it.
