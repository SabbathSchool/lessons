## NOTES

1. THE TOUCH OF FAITH — The disciples could not understand the difference between the selfish and curious crowding of the multitude and the touch of faith; but Jesus could. It was not the mere touch that healed, neither was it the clothes of Christ; it was the power of Christ in response to the faith of the woman. Faith has been defined as "the soul's grasp of Christ's power to save," and here was its manifestation. She saw by faith the healing already accomplished, she appropriated the boon desired by manifesting her faith. There is all the difference between the prayer of faith and the formal prayer as between the touch of faith and the casual touch. The world may see no more difference in the mere words of the prayer than they do in the contact of the touches. But the prayer of true faith lays hold of the power of God even as the touch of faith brought virtue from Christ.

2. RAISING OF JAIRUS' DAUGHTER — That she was dead the people knew. That she would surely wake as though asleep He to whom all power is given also knew. He spoke of things that were not as though they were, for in his power and purpose they were facts. He simply "spake, and it was done." The spirit — the breath of life — given by God, came back at the command of Him who had first given it to man, and the daughter lived again. The words "Talitha cumi," "Maiden, arise," were spirit and life because spoken by the Lord of life.
