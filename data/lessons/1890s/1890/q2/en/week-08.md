## NOTE

The history of Moses furnishes a wonderful instance of the confidence and courage born of faith. When Moses trusted in his own strength and military skill to lead the people of Israel from Egypt, and began the work, a poor laborer's taunt made him tremble, and the rumor of the king's anger made him flee for his life. But when he went bearing the commission of Heaven, distrusting his own ability, and trusting only in God, Pharaoh on his throne, surrounded by all his soldiers, could not cause him to fear. And so he "left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king." Truly, "in the name of the Lord is strong confidence."
