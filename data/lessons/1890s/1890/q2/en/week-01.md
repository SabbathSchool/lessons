## NOTES

"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, . . . but exhorting one another." Here is undoubted reference to church gatherings for mutual encouragement. The prayer and social meeting is a means of grace which no one can neglect except at the loss of spirituality. Since the words of the apostle were inspired by the Holy Spirit, we have here a divine injunction to assemble for exhortation and prayer. To attend the prayer-meeting and to take part in the service, is a duty which everyone who joins the church of Christ takes upon himself. The one who neglects this duty is unfaithful to his church vows. It may be noted here, for the encouragement of some and for the instruction of others, that the best exhortation that can be given is a humble, grateful testimony of praise to God for his goodness, and of trust in his mercy.

It seems evident, however, from what follows, that the apostle had more in mind than simply the prayer-meeting, and that his language comprehends the entire church as a body of believers. The exhortation not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together is really an exhortation against apostatizing. To forsake the assembling of ourselves together is a mark of indifference. So closely is the assembling of Christians associated with the profession of Christianity, that one who willfully neglects the one, inevitably gives up the other. The members of the church are members of one body; and when they cease to be as perfectly joined together as are the members of the human body, they cease to live.

"If we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth," etc. This language has often been grievously misapplied, and has been the means of discouraging people for whom there was hope. It is a terrible mistake to apply it to those to whom we have been presenting what we see to be truth, and to which they assent, but which they do not give evidence of intending to obey. It is not for us to judge. We cannot know the nature of the soil into which the truth has fallen, and we cannot tell how long it may take for it to take root and bear fruit. Neither should we say that there is no hope for the professed Christian who falls into error. Our God is a God that "pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage; he retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy." Micah 7:18.

The twenty-sixth verse should be read in the light of verse twenty-nine. The sin of which the apostle speaks is the sin of one who deliberately turns his back upon the assembly of God's people, and not only sins, but despises the Saviour of sinners, trampling him under foot, and counting his blood as unholy and worthless. He not only defies God's law, but he spurns his offer of pardon. What greater insult could be offered to God? For such an one there can be no hope, because he rejects the only source of hope.

Note the force of the language of verse 26, as addressed to the Hebrews, in view of what has gone before. The apostle has demonstrated that the sacrifices of the earthly sanctuary never had any virtue to cleanse from sin, but that they typified the one sacrifice of Christ, and that even the shadow has now passed away, since Christ has suffered once for all. He is the only sacrifice for sin; therefore if one rejects him there is no hope.
