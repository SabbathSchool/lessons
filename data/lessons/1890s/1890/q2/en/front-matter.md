## Introductory Note

The student will find many texts and suggestions in the notes to these lessons that are not directly brought out in the questions, which will furnish material aid in the preparation of the lessons. Let him first go through the lesson, looking up and reading carefully each text that is referred to. Read the context in each instance, and look up any passages of Scripture that may occur to your mind as bearing on the same point. Do not make any special attempt at this time to trace the connection of the various texts cited as answers to the questions, but endeavor to get a good idea of each individual text.

Then read the notes carefully. Go through the lesson again in the same way, only before turning to the texts cited, see if you can recall the substance of them, and read each text over slowly and carefully at least six times. When you know what each text contains, and can recall it by the question and the reference, go over the lesson again, trying to note the object of each question, and the connection of the various texts. A lesson learned in this way will prove a blessing to the student long after it has been recited. The teacher should frame his extra questions with reference to the notes.
