## NOTES

"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses," etc. The word rendered "witnesses" is the word martyros, "martyrs," signifying, in the singular, a witness; one who bears testimony." It is never used in the sense of "viewing," but always of one who gives evidence. Those who suffered for the cause of truth were called martyrs because they bore witness with their blood to the truth which they held. So Christ is said by the apostle Paul to have "witnessed a good confession" before Pontius Pilate. 1 Tim. 6:13. Heb. 12:1 has sometimes been used to prove that all the ancient worthies are looking down upon us, to see how we run, and this is considered as fully establishing the doctrine of the natural immortality of the soul. But such an exposition does violence to the text, besides contradicting scriptures which teach that the dead know not anything. Those men of old are not surveying us; but they have by their lives borne a good testimony to the power of faith; and of this testimony there is an abundance. Seeing, then, that there is so much unimpeachable testimony, we ought not to doubt.

There is another truth which may be suggested by this text, and that is that God, Christ, and the angels are intently watching us in our struggle, and that the record they bear will testify for or against us in the Judgment. This also should serve as a spur and incentive to us to press forward.

"Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame." Phil. 2:5-8, which is referred to in this connection, reads as follows, according to the Revised Version: "Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God [Greek, "originally with God," compare John 1:1], counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross." The joy that was set before Jesus was the salvation of souls. When he sees the travail of his soul, that is, the result of the travail of his soul, he will be satisfied. It was not for any personal good that he could gain that he suffered; for he had all heaven already. Equal with the Father, having life in himself, the creator and upholder of the universe, receiving the adoration of the highest angels, there was nothing that could be added to him. But when he saw mankind in sin and suffering, doomed to eternal death, he did not account his lofty place in heaven a thing to be desired. So great was his love for fallen humanity, that he could not enjoy heaven till he had rescued from perdition all who would receive his kind offices. So he "emptied himself,"—laid aside his joy,—that he might have the (to him) greater pleasure of saving sinners. Surely it is worth while to consider him. If we would continually look upon him, viewing him in his true character, who could become weary and discouraged? Such love as that, combined with divine power, will surely be sufficient to make us "more than conquerors."

"And make straight [even] paths for our feet." This must mean the removing of those obstacles that would hinder us in running. The weights that hold us back are, by a slight change in the figure, considered as things lying in the path. This is done in order that the thought may be impressed that the things which hinder us in the Christian race hinder others also. The things which weigh us down in the Christian race are stumbling-blocks to others. And since no man liveth to himself, we should remove them, not alone on our own account, but in order that feeble ones may not be turned out of the way by them.
