### NOTE

"FOR the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him." 2 Chron. 16:9. This must not be understood as meaning that the Lord shows himself strong in behalf of those only who have attained perfection, for such an assurance as that would be only a discouragement. If God helped only those who are perfectly righteous, he would help nobody; for none can be strong to do good without his strength. If they could attain perfection without his strength, then they certainly would have no need of it. The force of the word "perfect" in this verse may be seen from 1 Chron. 12:38, where it is said of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who came to acknowledge David as king over Israel: "All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king." The word rendered "perfect" is, literally, "whole." In the Jewish translation it is rendered "entire." This idea is carried out in 1 Chron. 12:33, which says that the men were "not of double heart." They had only one purpose; they were sincere in their profession of loyalty to David. So the Lord will give all his strength to the support of those who sincerely desire him, who seek him with a whole heart. And this strength, bestowed on those who, while weak and sinful, sincerely desire God and his righteousness, is that which, if it is not hindered, will raise them to the height of moral perfection.

This is why the exhortation is given to all, "Be strong, and of good courage." Many think that they cannot be strong and of good courage, because they do not feel strong; they know that they are weak. But the exhortation is to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. His strength is made perfect in weakness. The thought that God is all-powerful, and that all his might is waiting to serve those who sincerely desire it, is enough to give courage and strength to the weakest one who once really believes it.
