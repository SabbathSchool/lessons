## NOTE

THE following definitions from Webster's dictionary make sufficiently clear the meaning of witchcraft:—

"Witchcraft. 1. The practice of witches; sorcery; enchantments; intercourse with evil spirits."

"Sorcery. Divination by the assistance, or supposed assistance, of evil spirits, or the power of commanding evil spirits; magic; enchantment; witchcraft."

"Enchantment. 1. The art of producing certain wonderful effects by the invocation or aid of demons, or the agency of certain supposed spirits; the use of magic arts, spells, or charms; incantations."

Another synonym is "necromancy," which is thus defined:—
