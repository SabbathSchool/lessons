## NOTE

FAITH is superior to reason, but not contrary to it. The most reasonable thing in the world is that man should have faith. The case of Gideon's victory shows how much more reasonable faith is than reason itself. Reason would have taken that thirty-two thousand men and massed them in one solid phalanx and hurled them on the foe. But only men of desperate courage could win in that way against fearful odds, and a large part of Gideon's army were cowards. Even if the ten thousand who were not cowards, or who were ashamed to acknowledge themselves to be such, had been able to conquer the Midianites, it would have been at a great sacrifice of human life. But now see how it worked with God's plan. When, in obedience to Gideon's directions, his men broke the vessels that concealed their torches, there stood each man sharply outlined against the darkness, apparently the leader of a division; so that to the Midianites it would seem that they were being attacked by innumerable warriors. A panic seized them, and the victory was won without Israel's losing a man. It is easy to see the reasonableness of faith when the event is past. Then it is sight. We are permitted to see these things in order that we may learn to exercise faith when the prospect offers no hope to human eyes.
