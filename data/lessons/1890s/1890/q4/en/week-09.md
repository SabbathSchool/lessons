## NOTE

THE strength of Israel lay in that which made them different from other nations. When they became dissatisfied, and wanted to be "like other people," they were simply expressing a wish to be put on a level with them. But that was to make them much inferior to the nations around them; for the Israelites were but few in comparison with the other nations, and in a contest depending only on human strength, numbers would of course gain the victory. If it had not been that God did not cast off his people when they rejected him, the nation of Israel would soon have been blotted from existence.
