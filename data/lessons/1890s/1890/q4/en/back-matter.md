"Savonarola, the Florentine Martyr."  
"Life of Eld. J. G. Matteson."

# THE AMERICAN SENTINEL

## AN EIGHT-PAGE WEEKLY JOURNAL

**DEVOTED TO**

The Defense of American Institutions, the Preservation of the United States Constitution as it is, so far as Regards Religion or Religious Tests, and the Maintenance of Human Rights, Civil and Religious.

**It will Ever be Uncompromisingly Opposed to Anything tending toward a UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE, Either in Name or in Fact.**

IT is well known that there is a large and influential association in the United States bearing the name of the "National Reform Association," which is endeavoring to secure such a

**Religious Amendment to the Constitution**

Of the United States as will "place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages, on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."

While there are many persons in this country who are opposed to, or look with suspicion upon, this movement, there are few, outside of the party, who realize what the influence of this amendment would be. The object of the AMERICAN SENTINEL will be to

**Vindicate the Rights of American Citizens,**

Which, we believe, are threatened by this association. It will appeal to the very fundamental principles of our Government, and point out the consequences which would be sure to follow should they secure the desired Amendment to the Constitution.

Every position taken will be carefully guarded and fortified by sound argument. Due respect will always be paid to the opinions of others, but

**The Rights of Conscience will be Fearlessly Maintained.**

**TERMS:**

Single Copy, per year, post-paid                                          $1.00  
In Clubs of 10 or more, per copy, per year,                               .75
