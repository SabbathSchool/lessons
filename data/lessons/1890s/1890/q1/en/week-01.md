## NOTES

HEBREWS 7 is a most interesting chapter. The subject of the Melchizedek priesthood was introduced in chapter 5:6; but the depth of the subject, and the reflection that the brethren to whom he was writing had not properly improved their opportunities, and were not well prepared to appreciate the weighty truths of which he had to speak, led the writer to make a digression, in which he first described their condition, and then gave them a most solemn admonition, pointing out their great danger; and then gave them encouragement, setting before them the example of Abraham, and the faithfulness and righteousness of God in keeping his promises. By a happy and natural process he turns the subject of our hope, which rests on the promises made to Abraham, in the direction of the priesthood of Christ after the order of Melchizedek, from which he had been diverted, which is the great object of this letter.

WITHOUT indulging in any curious speculations, or dealing in any inferences, we find at least ten prominent points of difference between the two orders of priesthood. We will enumerate them as follows:—

1. Christ's priesthood is kingly; it is on the throne of his Father in Heaven. Aaron had no kingship.
2. In his priesthood no genealogy was reckoned. In Aaron's line no one could act unless his genealogy was clear and undisputed.
3. He was born of the tribe of Judah, though that fact was in nowise material to his priesthood. The other priests were of the tribe of Levi, and this was a necessity.
4. He can save completely, or to the uttermost. Their priesthood and service made nothing perfect.
5. His priesthood is in heaven. Theirs was earthly.
6. His priesthood is perpetual, not transferable. Theirs was temporary; their death caused a succession.
7. He is ever without sin. They had infirmity, and were sinners, even as others.
8. He offered but one sacrifice. They offered many, daily, year by year continually.
9. He offered no sacrifice for himself. They had to offer for themselves.
10. He was constituted priest by an oath of God. Their priesthood was arranged through a mortal man.

It would be difficult to add anything to the evidences of the dignity and efficiency of our high priest. It was pertinent that the Lord should inquire what more could have been done to his vineyard—his people—that he has not done. Isa. 5:1-7. What fruit shall we render to him for such wondrous provision for our salvation?

At this point the apostle sums up and applies the argument, and then passes from the difference of the priests to the difference of the covenants under which they served, including the difference of the offerings. This line of argument he continues until he comes to the close of all priestly work, and the coming again of the Son of God unto the full salvation of them that look for him.
