## NOTES

THE first of the blessings of the gospel is the forgiveness of sins. The term for this in the quotation in Hebrews is, "I will be merciful to their unrighteousness." The next is the writing of the law in the hearts of the people. Then comes the final blotting out of sins: "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." And then comes the close of probation, and the eternal inheritance, when "they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord." Jer. 31:34. Then all the people will be taught of the Lord. Isa. 54:13.

ISRAEL were indeed called the people of God; but his dealings with them abundantly prove, what the New Testament plainly declares, that only the faithful are really Israel, and no others were truly his people. The Lord sent word to Pharaoh, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me." Again he said, "Israel is my son, even my first-born." He also said he had seen the affliction of his people, and had come to deliver them, and to bring them into the land of Canaan. He did indeed deliver them out of Egypt, but of all the host that went out, only two were brought into the land of Canaan. The rest fell in the desert because of their unbelief. When they rebelled against God, they cut themselves off from being his people. And as he said in the prophecy, and in the text we have been considering, when they refused to continue in his covenant, he regarded them not. To be the people of God in truth we must have his law in our hearts.
