## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. The town clerk was undoubtedly a heathen; yet see how he had grasped the principle that truth can defend itself. Compare the words of Joash, the father of Gideon. Judges 6:28-31.

2. Note that this great tumult, which but for the prudent management of the town clerk, might have resulted in a wholesale persecution and massacre of the Christians, was wholly a business matter. The silversmiths' devotion to the goddess Diana was wholly a question of profit: from the worship of Diana they got their living. Their opposition to Paul was solely on account of the fact that the spread of Christianity interfered with their business. Even so in the days of Trajan, the persecution that was raised against the Christians, concerning which Pliny wrote to the emperor, was due to the fact that those who sold cattle for the heathen sacrifices, found their business diminishing.
