## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. "And when they opposed themselves." The student must not make the mistake of playing upon the words "opposed themselves," as is sometimes done in the case of 2 Tim. 2:25, and saying that the writer means to teach that those who oppose the truth oppose themselves. The single Greek word from which the words "oppose themselves" are rendered, will by no means bear such a construction as is often put upon these words. It means simply, "set themselves in opposition." A reference to Rom. 13:2; James 4:6; 5:6, and 1 Peter 5:5, where the same Greek word is rendered, "resist," "resisteth," will show that it could not possibly be used in the sense of making opposition to one's self.

2. Gallio, deputy of Achaia, was brother of the philosopher Seneca, the tutor of the emperor Nero.

3. Verse 22. Paul landed at Caesarea, and "went up and saluted the church." Although Jerusalem is not mentioned, it is generally accepted that the "going up" was to that city. The expression is literally correct, as applied to a journey from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
