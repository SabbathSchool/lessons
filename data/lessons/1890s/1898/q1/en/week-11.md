## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Since the special meeting spoken of at Troas was on the first day of the week, in the night, when, in the ordinary language of the present day, was it? What day was it when he resumed his journey?

2. Note that Paul was much delayed on his voyage from Philippi to Troas; since he was at Troas seven days, at what time must he have arrived there?

3. Note the change in pronouns in verses 6-14. The writer says "we" till the close of verse 6; then in verses 7-12 he says "the disciples," and "they;" and from that point onward he says "we" again; what does this show? Compare verses 13, 14.

4. Since Paul was so anxious to get to Jerusalem, why should he have tarried at Troas just seven days? Does the time when he arrived there, throw any light on this?

5. Note the harmony of the narrative throughout. Paul was anxious to get to Jerusalem; having been hindered by the slowness of the vessel from spending the Sabbath that he had designed to with the church at Troas, he waited there seven days, so that he could spend one Sabbath with them; yet in order to lose no more time than was absolutely necessary, he sent his traveling companions on with the boat as soon as the Sabbath was past, while he himself remained to hold one last meeting, knowing that he could overtake the others by a shorter route the next morning on foot.
