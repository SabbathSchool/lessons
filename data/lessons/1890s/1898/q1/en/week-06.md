## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Who received the stripes and imprisonment at Philippi? Had any of the other brethren been assaulted by the mob? Yet what did Paul and Silas do as soon as they got out of prison? What words written by Paul did he thus experience? 2 Cor. 1:3-6.

2. "Saying that there is another king, one Jesus." See how they tried to fasten the charge of treason upon the disciples. Show how those who are loyal to Jesus may in these days be accused of treason to the state.

3. Compare Acts 17:14, 15 with 1 Thess. 2:17, 18; 3:1-6. From this it will be seen that Paul desired to go back to Thessalonica, and that such was his interest for the brethren in that place, that, much as he needed the help and company of Timothy, he sent him back to Thessalonica, and he remained for a time in Athens alone.
