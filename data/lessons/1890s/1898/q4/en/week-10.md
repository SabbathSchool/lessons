### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 224-229.

### NOTES
1. "Jacob said, 'All these things are against me.' It was a great mistake. Joseph was alive—the governor of Egypt—sent there to preserve their lives, and to be the stay of Jacob's closing years. Simeon was also alive—the blessed link which was drawing and compelling his brothers to return into the presence of the strange Egyptian governor. Benjamin would come safely back again. All things, so far from being against him, were working together for good to him; and if only he would trust in God, he would live to see it so. All things are yours, if you are Christ's. All things serve you. Even those that seem most awry and trying are really promoting your best interests. . . . Let us cultivate the habit of looking at the bright side of things. If there are only a few clouds floating in your sky, do not state that the whole is overcast; and if all the heaven is covered, save one small chink of blue, make much of that; and by all means do not exaggerate the darkness."—Meyer.

2. "By the laws of caste, the Egyptians were forbidden to eat with people of any other nation. The sons of Jacob had therefore a table by themselves, while the governor, on account of his high rank, ate by himself, and the Egyptians also had separate tables."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 228.
