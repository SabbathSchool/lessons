### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 195-203; "Mount of Blessing," pages 193, 194; "Great Controversy," pages 613-634.

### NOTES
1. "Mahanaim" signifies two hosts. Jacob named the place "Mahanaim," because he saw two host of heavenly angels. It is when passing through the deepest waters, encompassed with greatest doubt and perplexity, difficulty and danger, that the angels of God encamp about the children of His care. If by the eye of faith we could only see them day by day, as they really are, no fear would disturb our souls. See Deut. 32:10; Ps. 32:8; 2 Chron. 16:9; 2 Kings 6:14-17; Ps. 34:7.

2. Jacob's external struggle was the result of a mightier struggle within. It was a strife between self and God. When the angel gained the victory over that soul, Jacob was crucified; it was then that, in the strength of his mighty Contestant, he conquered; it was then that Jacob, the Supplanter, could receive a new name, Israel, Prince of God, power with man. That night had been one of darkness and suffering, but the morning was one of light and glory. The greatest suffering precedes the greatest glory. Now Jacob could see the face of God, and as he "passed over Penuel," the sun rose upon him. Just so, when we pass through "the night of Jacob's trouble," we shall be prepared through suffering, with bodies glorified, to behold with joy the face of God; and "the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings." Suffering precedes the glory. See Luke 24:26; Dan. 11:35; Acts 14:22; Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:18; 2 Tim. 2:12.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY
1. What will become of us when Christ prevails? What is our name before Christ takes us? What after? After our "royal birth," what are we to be with God? See Rev. 20:6; 22:4, last clause.

2. How only can we have power over wicked men for good? When only do we really live? When do we live most?

3. When a man becomes a prince with God, what becomes of the prince of this world?

4. Draw a careful comparison between Jacob in his time of trouble, and the remnant people of God in their time of trouble.

5. Show that the Angel was Christ. See Hosea 12:4, 5.

6. What other persons do you think of whose names the Lord changed? Whose names are yet to be changed?

7. How does God wrestle with us, and we with God? What for? and with what result?

8. What effect should trial and adversity have upon the servant of God always? Does it have this effect upon me?
