### FALL SUBSCRIPTION BOOKS

#### TEN THOUSAND ACCEPTANCES

Is quite a response to a single invitation! Let us explain. Six months ago we used these columns to invite our friends to circulate "The Story of Redemption." They responded promptly, and the first edition of 10,000 was sold. Another edition is now printed, and the invitation has not been withdrawn.

The first report of one agent showed the value of orders taken to average $1.50 per hour; another shows $1.70 per hour; while another says "The people are delighted with 'The Story of Redemption.'"

- Cloth, lemon edge - $1.00
- Cloth, gilt edge - $1.25
- Prospectus - $0.60

#### Live Issues

Are treated in "The Coming King." That's why it sells so easily. Another reason is, its 290 pages are illustrated with over 180 engravings. There are other reasons, but we haven't space to give them here, and then you can get the book itself in:

- Cloth, plain edge, for $1.00
- Cloth, gilt top, for $1.50
- Prospectus - $0.60

For terms and territory, address your State Tract Society, or
Pacific Press Publishing Co., Oakland, Cal.

#### It sells easily

Is the testimony of those who canvass for "Christ Our Saviour." Ladies and even young girls have been especially successful with this beautiful little volume.

### THE DESIRE OF AGES

*[Actual Size, 7x10½]*

The above is the title of the long-looked-for life of Christ, by Mrs. E. G. White. It is much more than a life of Christ, however; it is a use of that life as a great object lesson with which to illustrate the principles of true Christian living. For that reason no more important book can be placed before a people living, as we are, amid the perils of the last days.

For over ten years the author has been at work on the manuscript, and for a year and a half a corps of New York's best artists, under the supervision of our own art director, have been engaged in studying and illustrating it. Their work consists of 38 full-page engravings, 87 illuminated chapter headings, and nearly 300 text illustrations. All of these have been designed especially for this book.

There is nearly twice as much matter in this book as in "Great Controversy," hence it seemed necessary at first to publish it in two volumes, but enlarging the page to 7x10 inches enables us to issue it in one 900-page volume at the following prices:
- Cloth, marbled edges - $3.50
- Cloth, gilt edges - $4.25
- Library, marbled edges - $5.00
- Full Morocco, gilt edges - $7.00
- Prospectus - $1.25

It will be ready about Oct. 15th. For terms and territory, address your State Tract Society.

### The World's Progress

FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY

In just a few months it will be twenty-five years since the Signs of the Times was started on its mission.

These twenty-five years have marked exceedingly marvelous developments in the fulfilling of prophecy. This wonderful procession of events, showing that the Lord's coming is right at hand, is most intensely thrilling when we take time to consider it.

On January 5, 1899, the Signs of the Times will be a 32-page double number, with an artistic, decorative cover, making four pages more. In this issue, these wonderful fulfillments of prophecy during the last twenty-five years will be set forth. The very best of writers are preparing the matter now. Good artists are illustrating it fully so as to clearly present, in the light of God's great prophetic word, the absorbing movements and conditions of this time.

This will be the most important issue of the Signs of the Times ever printed, and it should have at least a million circulation. Every Sabbath-school Superintendent, officer, teacher, and scholar is needed to help in this work. Write us at once for further particulars. Lay your plans without delay to do your part in placing a copy of this issue of the Signs in every home in all the land.

Following are a few of the topics that will be presented:

| Topics |
|-------|
| Marked Development of Church and State During 25 Years |
| European Changes for a Quarter Century |
| Striking Inventions for 25 Years |
| Military and Naval Development, and Its Meaning |
| The Development of the Money Power, and its Place in Prophecy |
| False Religions and Isms—Their Rise and Development |
| Progress in Astronomy |
| Progress in Medical Science |
| Medical Missionary Work |
| Summary of Prophetic Fulfillment |
| Sabbath Reform, True and False |
| Testimony of the Ancient Monuments (Witnesses in Stone) |
| The Last Reformation (Predicted by Prophet and Reformer) |
| Demand for a Definite Message |
| The Gospel of Christ |

But we have not space to say more here. Drop us a card for our illustrated announcement. Address,

SIGNS OF THE TIMES, Oakland, Cal.
