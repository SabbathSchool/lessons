| SUNDAY     | Name the persons and places mentioned in the lesson, and locate the places on the map. Pronounce and define the hard words.                                    |
| MONDAY     | Let each tell what he can of the lesson, and then read it over, carefully noting the points which were not remembered.                                         |
| TUESDAY    | Repeat verses already committed to memory. Read the "Spirit of Prophecy" on the lesson, or study the lesson from the Instructor or Little Friend.              |
| WEDNESDAY  | Let each give a synopsis of the lesson, or tell the lesson story. Look up the ancient manners and customs referred to.                                         |
| THURSDAY   | Name again the persons mentioned, and tell what each said or did. Give time and place of each event.                                                          |
| FRIDAY     | Ask the questions from the lesson book, study the notes, and repeat the memory verses.                                                                        |
| SABBATH    | Let each repeat as much of the lesson scripture as possible. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson. Relate personal experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been helpful. |

(This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily, systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school lessons.)

## PREFACE

THE most thorough student of the book of Genesis will know that he has only begun to comprehend the majestic truths recorded there; for from the first to the last chapter, whether as history or as prophecy, he finds divine revelations of "the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God," and can but exclaim, with Paul, "How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past tracing out!" The history and the prophecy, the types and the symbols, the forms and ceremonies, the manners and customs, the style of thought and method of expression—all show that the patriarchs were men of great intellectual penetration and spiritual foresight. And those whose history is specially recorded, were men who loved to commune with God, their recognized strength. They saw the history of God's people in the plan of redemption unto the final consummation. The mighty workings in their souls of the mystery of iniquity, or of the mystery of godliness, was typical of the great struggle which is continually going on in the hearts of the children of men. Thus every recorded act of theirs is "for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come."

This series has been interspersed with lessons by the topical, or outline, method. These are given only as models, and the student should outline each lesson for himself, studying the Scripture texts, asking and answering questions, reciting and reviewing lessons, from such outlines from week to week. The same order and method of study are otherwise recommended as during the past quarter.
