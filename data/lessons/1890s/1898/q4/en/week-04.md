### READINGS
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 188-194.

### NOTE
It was Jacob's own course that rendered his experience in Haran necessary. "Evil imparted, also returns again. Every one who has been free to condemn, or discourage, will in his own experience be brought over the ground where he has caused others to pass; will feel what they have suffered because of his want of sympathy and tenderness. It is the love of God toward us that has decreed this. He would lead us to abhor our own hardness of heart, and to open our hearts to let Jesus abide in them. And thus, out of evil, good is brought, and what appeared a curse becomes a blessing. . . . In slighting the claims of the poor, the suffering, and the sinful, we are proving ourselves traitors to Christ. It is because men take upon themselves the name of Christ, while in life they deny His character, that Christianity has so little power in the world. The name of the Lord is blasphemed because of these things."—Mount of Blessing, pages 180, 181.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY
