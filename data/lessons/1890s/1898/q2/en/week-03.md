## Additional Questions and Suggestions

1. Paul acknowledged that the Jews who were clamoring for his blood had a zeal for God; quote a text in which he tells what was lacking with their zeal. Give reference.
2. Note the tact that Paul displayed in addressing the Jews in their own tongue instead of in the Greek, which even among them was commonly used. See also how he shows that the one man who had any part to act in his conversion was a Jew who was in good repute among all his fellow-countrymen.
3. When the Lord appeared to Saul on the way to Damascus, why did he not tell him what he was to do instead of sending Ananias to him?
