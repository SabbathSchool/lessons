### NOTES.

1. In verse 7 is the inspired record of the origin of man. He was formed out of the dust of the ground, and then by the breath of God became a living soul. For continued existence Adam and Eve were dependent upon the tree of life (Gen. 3:22); so, being probationers in Eden (Gen. 2:17), they were not immortal even then, much less since that time. Man is now wholly mortal. "Dying thou shalt die," refers to the whole man.

2. "The Lord knew that Adam could not be happy without labor; therefore, He gave him the pleasant employment of dressing the garden. And, as he tended the things of beauty and usefulness around him, he could behold the goodness and glory of God in His created works. Adam had themes for contemplation in the works of God in Eden, which was heaven in miniature. God did not form man merely to contemplate His glorious works; therefore, He gave him hands for labor, as well as a mind and heart for contemplation. If the happiness of man consisted in doing nothing, the Creator would not have given Adam his appointed work. Man was to find happiness in labor as well as in meditation. Adam could take in the grand idea that he was created in the image of God, to be like Him in righteousness and holiness. His mind was capable of continual cultivation, expansion, refinement, and noble elevation; for God was his teacher and angels were his companions."—Redemption, E. G. W., pp. 7, 8.

3. God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided an "helpmeet for him, —a helper corresponding to him,—one who was fitted to be his companion, and who could be one with him in love and sympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him, as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self; showing the close union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this relation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.

4. Adam and Eve being made "in the image of God," and "but little lower than the angels," the glory of God must have shined forth from them as from no other portion of His creation on the earth. They "were draped in light, as were the heavenly angels."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1, p. 41. "The robe of light which had enshrouded them, now disappeared."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 57. This chapter shows that Adam and Eve talked with God in Eden. "The pure in heart live as in the visible presence of God during the time He apportions them in this world. And they will also see God face to face in the future immortal state, as did Adam when he walked and talked with God in Eden."—Mount of Blessing, p. 43.
