## Letter from the Publisher

```
PRINTERS,  
PUBLISHERS,  
BINDERS.                 PUBLISHERS OF SIGNS OF THE TIMES.

Oakland, Cal., July 1, 1898.

To 28,000 S. S. Students,

Dear Friends:- What an army of men and women, old and young, are reached each quarter by the edition of 26,000 of this pamphlet! If all were in line ready to do service for the Lord how the enemies' ranks would be broken and shattered! Many are ready and anxious to join the Lord's side and to be doing something for Him, but are looking for what they consider a favorable opportunity. Are you one of that class?

Last quarter we called attention to an opportunity that was favorable, and which, if improved, would be followed by results pleasing both to God and to the worker. That opportunity was for you to send us one subscriber; as you are one of the 26,000. The opportunity is still open, is favorable yet, and is never limited to one new subscriber only.

If you are not one who has already responded to our call for help in circulating "the able minister", the SIGNS OF THE TIMES, will you not be one at once, and write for special terms to agents, sample copies, etc. If it is only a little that you can do, don't think it is too small to be done, but let us hear from you.

Yours in the Master's service,

OAKLAND, CAL.                                    SIGNS OF THE TIMES
