### READINGS.
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 145-155.

### NOTES.
1. Abraham had become so accustomed to the voice of God that he could not mistake it, but stepped out by faith upon that which could not have been other than mysterious darkness, and yet found his foot planted upon the Solid Rock, the Sure Foundation, the Fountain of Faith, in the arm of Him who said, "I am the Almighty God."

2. Mount Sinai is Hagar, which gendereth unto bondage; but Mount Moriah, Mount Calvary, is Isaac, which gives birth to freedom. This is the "glorious holy mountain," "the mountain of the Lord;" as it is said, "In the mountain of the Lord it shall be seen." What?—Jehovah-jireh, "the Lord will provide." What?—The Lamb. "God will provide Himself a Lamb for the burnt-offering." What Lamb?—Oh, "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"! Praise the Lord. See "Great Controversy," pp. 18, 19. For the distinction between the covenants see Gal. 4:22-31.

3. Perfect faith works perfect obedience. God could not confirm His covenant with an oath until Abraham had fulfilled this condition explicitly stated in Gen. 17:1, 2. The original Hebrew for the word "make" in verse 2 is "give." This shows that even the covenant, as well as the power to keep it, was a free gift by grace. Abraham had shown his lack of faith and obedience in looking to Eleazer as his heir, and in taking Hagar to be his wife. As a result he was also fearful, as is shown by his lack of truthfulness before Pharaoh (Gen 12:13), before Abimelech (Gen. 20:2), and no doubt in many other places since leaving Haran (verse 13). This last great close test came upon Abraham because of these failures. He was tried to the uttermost, but not above what he was able to bear in the strength which had been offered him. The Lord revealed to him the truthfulness of the statement, "I will also with the temptation make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it." He also saw that God brings men over the ground again and again, until perfect humility and transformation of character bring them into harmony with Christ and the Spirit of heaven, and they are victors over themselves.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY.

1. Read Genesis 20 and 21, and note Abraham's relations with Abimelech, his test of faith and obedience in sending away Hagar and Ishmael according to Sarah's word.

2. That the everlasting covenant was made with others than Abraham see 2 Sam. 23:5; Isa. 54:10, etc.

3. At his birth he was called Isaac, laughter, rejoicing. How does this illustrate the birth of Christ?

4. Satan's design in tempting us is our destruction; God's design is our salvation. Study carefully Heb. 11:17-19.

5. Name in order, and locate as far as possible, all the places where Abraham sojourned or pitched his tent since leaving Haran.

6. Abraham had forsaken home, countrymen, and earthly friends, had become a pilgrim in a strange land, had been entirely separated from Lot, had exiled Hagar and Ishmael, and now was asked to offer up his only-begotten son. Why was all this? See James 2:21-23.

7. How many times did the Lord renew His promise to Abraham? Note the additional surety in each case.
