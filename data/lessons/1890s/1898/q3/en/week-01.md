### NOTES.

1. The first verse of the Bible reveals God as Creator; the last, as Redeemer; and both, like every verse between the two, reveal Him as He is, a God of love. To fallen man the Gospel in creation becomes the Gospel of salvation. But lost man may not see God in the book of nature either as Creator or as Redeemer; therefore, God in His mercy and love has given him the book of Revelation. But even here man sees only in part. In Gen. 1:1 are revealed the deep things of God in mysteries. "In the beginning"—who can tell just when?—"God"—who can find Him out unto perfection?—"created"—who can explain the secret of the process?—"the heaven and the earth"—who has comprehended their range or their glory? But this is the Christian's God. "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all;" and yet "clouds and darkness are round about Him." By hiding He reveals Himself. His works and His manner of working are mysteries. He has robed all nature in garments which man can not fully rend: "Lo, these are but the outskirts of His ways; and how small a whisper do we hear of Him! but the thunder of His power who can understand?" Job 26:14, R. V. In this connection read "God in Nature," by Mrs. E. G. White, as recorded in General Conference Bulletin for 1897, No. 5, pp. 73, 74; or in "Special Testimonies on Education," pp. 56-62.

2. It is not beyond the power of faith to see that when He who is the light of the whole universe, in whom there is no darkness at all, who dwelleth in the light unapproachable, and in whose presence the sun is ashamed, was present, and said, "Let there be light, and there was light," that it should exist even before the sun was made on the fourth day. It is not hard for the child of trust to believe that He who now uses the sun to cause the "grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man," should by His own light cause the grass, herbs, and trees to spring forth in a single day, carpeting the whole earth with living green, lofty trees and magnificent flowers.

3. The infinite power of Him who upholds all the numberless worlds in limitless space, may not be called in question by finite man. To the Christian it is not a thing incredible that God should make this world and our solar system in just six days of twenty-four hours each, and in just the order named in the Mosaic record. On the contrary, it is just what we would expect of Him, that He should do a definite work in a definite time. For "He taketh up the isles as a very little thing," and the nations are to Him "as the small dust of the balance." It is in perfect harmony with His manner of working when upon the earth, in the healing of diseases and in the performance of the miracles of bread and wine, and of stilling the waves of the sea. It is just what we would expect of Him who takes note of the fall of the sparrow as well as the fall of the world. Our earth, compared with the universe of worlds, is, as it were, but a grain of sand upon the seashore. God has not revealed to us the process of creation further than that "He spake, and it was; He commanded, and it stood fast;" and this is enough so that by faith we may understand.

4. The expression "the stars also," calls attention to the fact that God made the stars as well as the sun and the moon. The names of the planets which revolve around our sun, in the order of their distances from it, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
