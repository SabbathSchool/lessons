### READINGS.

"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 125-138, 370, and 371. Gen. 16 and 17:9-27.

### NOTES.

1. From Ex. 12:40 we learn that the children of Israel sojourned 430 years. From the time that Jacob went into Egypt until the day that the children of Israel left there was 215 years, so that the sojourn in the land of Canaan after Abram came out of Ur of the Chaldees was 215 years.

2. The covenant of promise, the Adamic, the Abrahamic, the new covenant, is the covenant of grace which was made with Adam, with Noah, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with David, with all the holy men of old, and finally with all the children of faith, who become heirs and joint heirs with Christ of the promised possession through the blood of that same everlasting covenant. God, His character, His law, His government is perfect; and this necessitates perfect obedience on the part of all His subjects. This, however, fallen man in and of himself alone could not render; therefore, before God demanded it of Adam, of Abraham, or of any of their seed, He made known to them the source of their power. He prefaced His requirements with, "I am the Almighty God." Abraham understood what this meant, "because," as He, the Lord, said, "Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws." This power is brought to us as a gift by grace in and through Christ Jesus, the perfect Sacrifice. To Him was given all power in heaven and on earth; and when He came He is represented as being "full of grace and truth;" "and of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." "The wages of sin is death," but "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." "By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." When Christ came to seek and save that which was lost, He left His glory with His Father; He came in the likeness of sinful flesh, bearing the sins of many, that while in the flesh we might go from grace to grace; when made perfect, like Him, through sufferings, we might be glorified together; after which it will be no longer from grace to grace but from glory to glory. The everlasting covenant, then, is the covenant of grace, of peace, of and unto perfection, unto salvation, unto glory.

### ADDITIONAL STUDY.

1. Note Abraham's call and obedience. Heb. 11:8; Isa. 51:2; 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.

2. Note the enlargement of the Lord's promise to Abraham at each succeeding time until Abraham saw the promise to be universal and everlasting, applying not only to Jew but to Gentile, not only to the earthly but to the heavenly Canaan.
