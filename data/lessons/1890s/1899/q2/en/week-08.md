### NOTES

1. These twelve had for some time been disciples, i.e., learners. Upon their ordination they were called apostles, or those sent forth. They were sent forth to represent the Gospel church, as the twelve patriarchs had represented the tribes of Israel. See "Desire of Ages," pp. 291, 292. For knowledge of the dispositions of these men, see "Desire of Ages," p. 296.

2. The ordination of the twelve is supposed to have taken place on one of the two horn-like heights of Hattin. These were two hours' journey (from five to seven miles) west of Tiberias, overlooking the mouth of a gorge which opens into the cliffs of Arbela. The "plain" below these heights, to which the Saviour descended with His apostles, was easily accessible from the lake, yet only a few minutes' walk from the summit. This plain was a level space on the side-hill, well adapted for the gathering of a multitude. See "Desire of Ages," p. 299.

3. The Jews had come to believe that the amount of riches one possessed indicated the favor he had with God. Christ's teaching in this text was to destroy that illusion.

4. No wonder they were astonished. They had been accustomed to the verbal trifling of intricate sophistries, and the tortuous windings of tradition and prescription. They now heard these criticized and rejected for the plain, ungarnished Word. The great Teacher came not from any of the authorized schools, yet His teaching was fresh as the morning breeze upon the mountain-side. He appealed to no authority but the Word of God, tearing away from the law the false traditions which obscured its obvious import.
