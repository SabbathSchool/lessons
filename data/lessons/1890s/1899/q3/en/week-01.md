## NOTES

1. The news of John's death had doubtless to do with suggesting the proposed rest. It was to Christ the warning that His labors in Galilee must also soon terminate through the people's rejection of Him, and the shadow of His own violent death as well. There were many things to communicate to His apostles which could not well be said before the multitude. Besides, they needed a spot for quiet meditation and prayer. The Bethsaida, or Fish-house, here mentioned as the place of retirement, is supposed to have been a place six miles from Capernaum, at the head of the Sea of Galilee, east of Jordan, sometimes called Julias, in honor of Julia, a daughter of Emperor Augustus. It was beyond the territory of Herod Antipas, and in the tetrarchy of Philip, therefore entirely distinct from the place by that name west of the Sea of Galilee.

2. Formerly the Jews had but three watches of the night, enumerated as the first, or "beginning of the watches" (Lam. 2:19), the "middle watch" (Judges 7:19), and the "morning watch" (Ex. 14:24; 1 Sam. 11:11). These were respectively from sunset to 10 P.M., from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M., and from 2 A.M. to sunrise. At this time, however, they had mostly given up their own computation of the night watches, and adopted that of the Romans, namely, four watches, from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M., and known as even, midnight, cock-crowing, and morning. Mark 13:35. The "fourth" watch must, therefore, have been between 3 and 6 o'clock in the morning.
