## NOTES

1. Lazarus probably died about the time Jesus received the message bearing the news of his dangerous condition. Remaining in His place two days, and then occupying two days more by slow journey to Bethany, He found the funeral obsequies past, and the mourning ceremony in operation. To appear there after the death of Lazarus and raise him from the tomb, would be more evidence of Christ's Messiahship than to heal him from his sickness, because the Jews attributed such work to malign influences alone.

2. Dean Alford considers it evident from the peculiar construction of the original text that this question was an adverse criticism of the Lord's apparent helplessness. His tears were to them a mark of His lack of power to help the situation. The healing of the blind man (chapter 9) to them was surely a fraud, for had Jesus power to heal one so beloved, He certainly would not have delayed so long His appearance in Bethany.

3. Already, in the quiet of His own heart, Jesus had communed with God, and knew that His prayer regarding Lazarus was answered. In His audible prayer, therefore, He simply thanked the Father for hearing, that others might be benefited and the name of God glorified by what was to follow.

4. In effect Caiaphas said: "You have not considered that it is expedient for you, in view of your interests as priests and rabbis, that this one man should die, to save Israel from the certain destruction that threatens it, if you would let Him stir up a Messianic revolt; for in that case the whole nation would perish. The Romans will come with their legions, and close our temple, annul our independence by abolishing our laws, and waste us with fire and sword."â€”Geikie's Life of Christ, vol. 2, p. 316.
