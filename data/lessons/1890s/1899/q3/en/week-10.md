## NOTES

1. This feast occurred in December. It was celebrated by daily reading of prayers and singing the "Hallel,"â€”"Praise Ye Jehovah." Josephus says that the festival was also called "Lights."

2. There seemed but one retreat left for the persecuted Son of God. He had been rejected in Galilee, and now in Judea His life was threatened. But His life was yet to be extended. Jerusalem was the only place where fanatical zeal abounded enough to put to death such a being (Luke 13:34). So Jesus retired temporarily to the half-heathen country of Perea, east of the Jordan.

3. Moses had said that on certain considerations, divorce was lawful. The rabbis had so construed the Hebrew word used by Moses to convey the cause for divorce, as to make it cover the most frivolous excuse. The whole thing, however, seems to be summed up in this: If one saw any other woman which pleased him more than his wife, the excuse for divorce was an easy matter. In the eagerness of the Pharisees to tempt Christ, and to entangle Him in His talk, they pressed the matter upon Him. But the Lord's answer was discreet and silencing, and they failed in their object. It seems that, having determined on the death of Christ, and desiring to shield themselves before the people from the charge of putting Him to death, the question was put at that time, and in the studied form it was, that it might involve Christ in the difficulty which caused the death of John the Baptist. Herod Antipas, in whose dominion Christ was then staying, was a noted adulterer, and if Christ could be drawn into a position which would be a condemnation of Herod's course, that ruler might be induced to put the hated Nazarene out of the way.

4. Christ told the disciples, in substance, that all men could not receive their idea of the question. There were some, indeed, who must live single lives by circumstances of birth, or constitution; and some because of the mutilation endured through the cruel practises of bond-masters. Others there were of this class who, by special vow, had withdrawn themselves from society for the kingdom of heaven's sake. These were not better than others, but simply different. The marriage institution was created by Christ in Eden for a wise purpose, and must still be necessary, even though sin has overspread the world. 1 Cor. 7:2.
