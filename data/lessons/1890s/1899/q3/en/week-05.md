## NOTES

1. The disciples were evidently still clinging to the idea that the Saviour's kingdom was to be an earthly, tangible one, with His throne in Jerusalem, and that at the proper time He would there assume the reins of government. So on the journey toward Capernaum, and in anticipation of an early trip to Jerusalem, they fell to discussing the question of their relative fitness for positions of trust in the new commonwealth. This material view of the Lord's kingdom so barred the door of their hearts that the spiritual truths their Master wished to impress upon them could not find entrance.

2. French suggests that "tribute" in this text is an unfortunate rendering, inasmuch as it supposes a civil tax. The rate asked of Peter was the didrachma, or the half shekel of Ex. 30:11-16, which was required of every Israelite above twenty years old, for the current expenses of the tabernacle, and afterwards the temple. It was a piece of silver, in value about thirty-two cents, or one shilling and fourpence of English money.

3. Strangers being those only who were subject to tribute, the temple could not exact means from Him who was the Son of God, the great King, to whose temple service the money was to be applied. Priests and prophets were exempt from this tax. But the Son of God in that instance gives a beautiful example of waiving personal rights, in order to prevent wrong impressions, which would produce unnecessary friction. The money necessary to meet the demand was not on His person, but was to be found in the mouth of a fish. The stater, thus miraculously produced, was just enough to pay the needed amount not only for Christ, but also for Peter, His follower, who likewise was counted a resident of Capernaum.

4. The word from which comes "offense" means cause, occasion of wrong, or an inducement to sin.

5. Ancient kings shut themselves away from the gaze of men, but their counselors were privileged to behold their faces. See side text. The angels are thus said to behold the face of God, which is hidden from mortals. Ex. 33:20. These same angels being ministering spirits to the humble saints (Heb. 1:14), the latter have counsel with God through their ministering spirits, and so are the subject of heavenly counsel, regarding their difficulties and dangers.

6. "As an heathen." While a man may be regarded as a heathen, or a publican, and so unfit for church-fellowship, yet the Spirit of Christ teaches us to labor earnestly for the conversion of all such. This can not be accomplished by harsh treatment, or hateful words, or by abandonment. The only way to win any one, in whatever state or condition, is by kindness.

7. "Ten thousand talents," an expression conveying the idea of a hopelessly large debt. Literally it would be about $8,000,000. The smaller debt was about $15. The instruction in this chapter grew out of the dispute of the disciples as to who should be the greatest in the new kingdom which their early Jewish teachings had pictured as constituting their Master's prospective dominion. They had not yet learned that "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." Rom. 14:17.
