# SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSONS ON THE LIFE OF CHRIST

*For Senior Classes*

## THIRD QUARTER, 1899

## NOTE TO THE STUDENT

In the study of these lessons, let it be remembered that the Biblical account of this part of the life of Christ on earth is very fragmentary. Since God has not seen fit to give in the Bible the exact chronological order of events in the life of Christ, we may well believe that this is not of the highest importance. What we need most of all in the study of the Master's earth life is to see in His every word and act the manifestation of Jehovah's everlasting love for an erring and lost race, and to be so drawn toward Him, by beholding Him, that we may be brought to the likeness of Him who first created man in His own image. Then let speculative thought give way, in every case, and on every occasion, to an earnest desire fully to know the Lord, which is eternal life. To this end let every student devote much prayerful study to the lessons, that they may prove the source of a rich experience in the daily life.
