## NOTES

1. The evidence is strong that the invitation for Jesus to dine at the place was planned specially for the purpose of entrapping Him in some way. Although knowing this, and that eminent spies,—rabbis and Pharisees,—would be present, Jesus did not hesitate to accept the invitation. Before the company reclined to eat, Jesus saw a poor afflicted man enter the house, according to oriental license, when He put the main question of the occasion.

2. The couches on which the orientals reclined at meals were placed on three sides of the square from which the food was to be eaten. The other side was left open as a passage for the servants to bring on dishes, and serve food. The couch at the right was reserved for the most honored guest. This was counted the "chief place." The next couch was for the second in rank, and so on. At such occasions as the one under consideration, the rabbis schemed to secure the best position, sometimes even to offending the host.
