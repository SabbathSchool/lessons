## NOTES

1. Three questions were asked, involving the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem, which the disciples believed would stand until the end of all things, the sign of Christ's second coming, and the end of the age. Christ took up first in His answer the great event around which all others cluster—His second coming to earth—and treated that in a general way. He then spoke of the destruction of the temple as the beginning of a series of events which are to terminate in His coming.

2. That is, men would proclaim themselves the Anointed, and by certain signs and wonders, lead many to accept their statements for truth. See Matt. 24:24. This has ever been a favorite method employed by Satan to mislead honest souls.
