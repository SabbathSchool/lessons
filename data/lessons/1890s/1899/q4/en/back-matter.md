## HOW TO COOK Without Meat

Meat is admitted to be generally diseased, hence is unfit for food. A constantly-growing band of intelligent men and women are realizing this, and are discarding it. These people will appreciate a carefully-tested series of recipes for palatable foods, into the preparation of which meat does not enter. All this will be found in "A Friend in the Kitchen," by Mrs. Anna L. Colcord, of Cooranbong, Australia. The book contains 400 recipes, 128 pages, and is fully illustrated. It is bound in water-proof cloth, which may be washed the same as oilcloth. The price has not yet been fixed, but it will not exceed 75 cents. It will be subject to subscription-book discounts to agents.

## STORY OF A BOOK

### By A READER and OBSERVER

Having had more than ordinary opportunities of watching the preparation and placing of books on the market, I have thought a brief account of the same would interest and possibly profit my fellow book-lovers, hence this sketch.

The subject is a MS which has been over ten years in preparation, and which is the very chief of the author's numerous works. When completed it was placed in the hands of the Pacific Press Publishing Company, of Oakland, California, who at once recognized it as a masterpiece. As their examination grew more thorough, they realized what wonderful scope its beautiful and touching story would give the expert illustrator, and, desiring an appropriate setting for the riches of its text, they began to give the matter of illustrations careful study. In this they were so fortunate as to secure the services of Mr. W. A. Reaser, a very prominent American artist, who also acted as their Art Director. He associated with himself such men as Messrs. Mente, Pogarthy, Perard, Mora and Bardwell, and together they studied the MSS. that they might, by the use of fine illustrations, emphasize its most important parts. This illuminative work occupied nearly two years, and cost about $6,000.

Then followed the typesetting and printing, which was performed by the most skilful workmen the publishers had in their employ.

The selection of an appropriate title was left with the publishers, who sought the advice of a number of experts in books and book preparation. The title finally selected was furnished by Mr. E. M. Morrison, a well-known general agent. It was "THE DESIRE OF AGES," and was suggested to him by reading Haggai 2:7, where Christ is referred to as "the Desire of all nations."

After the printing had been done, and the sheets folded into signatures of 16 pages each, they were passed on to the bindery. These signatures were then gathered into complete books and sewed on tapes, which is the usual way of sewing office ledgers and other books requiring extra strong bindings.

The covers, or "cases" as they are called in a book bindery, were next made, and the illuminated titles stamped upon them in the embossing machine. Then, after trimming, rounding, backing, and several other minor processes, the sewed books were fitted and glued into the covers, carefully pressed, examined and wrapped for shipment.

All this, of course, took time, and the advance orders had commenced to come in with the result that on day of publication, Nov. 1, 1898, orders to the value of $14,967.25 had been received. It was impossible to prepare books with the requisite rapidity to promptly fill this unprecedented demand, although every effort was made to do so.

Before this time, the Review and Herald Publishing Company, of Battle Creek, Michigan, had purchased a set of plates, and later the Echo Publishing Company, of Melbourne, Australia, also ordered a set, from which each publisher prints for its regular trade.

I might state in explanation of the above statement that large books are not usually printed direct from type, but from electrotype plates. These plates are thin copper-faced metallic casts of the type pages, the manufacture of which is a trade in itself. These thin casts are then mounted on wood, when they are ready to be placed on the press. An unlimited number of electrotype plates may be made from the original page of type.

### A TRADE EDITION

Although the subscription edition which has just been described was entirely satisfactory for the library and the home, it was too expensive for some classes of would-be purchasers. One lady said to me, "I can get along without the fine bindings and illustrations, but I cannot get along without the fine reading." This was emphasized by many others, and as the publishers desired to place it within the reach of every one, they decided to issue a thin-paper edition without illustrations, size 5x7 inches.

The type on this edition was set on a type-setting machine called the Linotype, which is operated something like a typewriter, and which does the work of four or five men, making at the same time a metal cast of each line of type, from which electrotype plates are taken.

Plates for this edition, also, have been ordered by the Review and Herald Publishing Company, and it is expected that books will be ready for delivery by both houses in October. The prices, I understand, are $1.50 for the cloth binding, and $2.00 for the leather. The publishers are certainly to be congratulated on producing so large a book—it will contain more than a thousand pages—at so low a price. They do not anticipate that this edition will in any sense take the place of the elegantly illustrated and beautifully bound subscription book, but that it will be considered merely as a volume issued for the convenience of people desiring to loan or carry them, and those unable to purchase the better book.

I could not close this account of the mechanical preparation of the book without at least referring to its contents. In brief, my opinion is that there is no book outside the Bible that contains the rich instruction, the divine encouragement, and the soul comfort to be found in "THE DESIRE OF AGES."

and send both books to subscribers post-paid for 85 cents.

These editions will be limited to the actual number of acceptances received before November 1, and the completed books will be ready before the holidays.

### Description

Both volumes are too well known to make an extended description necessary, therefore we only give a very brief notice here, but will send further information if desired. The first is:

**The Story of Pitcairn Island**  
in which is given the romantic account of the mutiny on board the English sloop of war, "Bounty," and the subsequent adventures of the mutineers. A book of thrilling interest. Contains 266 pages and is well illustrated. Regular price in cloth, $1.00.

**Political Speeches and Debates**  
Edited by ALONZO T. JONES  
This book contains the public speeches and debates of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas from 1854 to 1861, also Lincoln's great speech at Gettysburg and his second Inaugural Address.

The principles over which these giants of the political arena contended are again manifesting themselves, hence it is important that we become intelligent concerning them, and this volume will greatly aid to that end. Then again, the speeches of Lincoln were always to the point, and afford good examples of effective use of the English language, and are well worthy of study on that account alone. It contains 555 pages, and the regular price in cloth is $1.75.
