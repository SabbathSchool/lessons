## NOTES

1. The sheep is used in the Scriptures as an emblem of meekness, patience, and submission, and thus typifies the qualities of the Lord Himself. Isa. 53:7; Acts 8:32. He was a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13:8. He is also the Chief Shepherd (1 Peter 5:4), who calleth His sheep by name, and they follow Him. John 10:4, 11.

2. A brief study of the side texts following questions 5 and 6 will show what importance the Scriptures attach to what is known as Christian Help Work. One may not be aware that he has done much toward relieving distress, or those to whom he has ministered may not appreciate that which was done for them; but Christ saw in the labor put forth, the reflection of His own life, and counted it as done for Him, and to represent His generous work in the earth. Therefore, the sincere desire to do something in this line, followed by conscientious effort, is marked in heaven, and weighs greatly on the right side of every account examined in the judgment; because the disposition to do such work shows a oneness with Christ, which entitles the holder to a place with Him. We are not to conclude from this that we obtain salvation and righteousness by our good works. We are saved not because we do, but we do because we are saved.
