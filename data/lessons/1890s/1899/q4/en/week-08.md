## NOTES

1. The woes had been pronounced in the outer court of the temple. The Lord, having done His duty in this line, calmly retired to the court of the women, the innermost point to which they were admitted, and there sat down opposite the treasury. This consisted of thirteen large chests, with openings shaped like the bell of a trumpet, to receive the free-will offerings of the people.

2. These offerings were for the priests and poor people. It made no difference to this woman in the warmth of her loving zeal, that she was poorer than some for whom a portion of the money was intended. Besides, she did not positively know just what disposition the priests would make of her offering. She simply answered a call of duty, and left results with Him who seeth and knoweth all things.

3. Jesus was to die, so that He might, like the planted wheat, bring forth a product like Himself. If these Greeks would see Him, and be like Him, let them bear in mind His work, and follow Him in it, and then they would have assurance of eternal life; otherwise they would abide alone in their knowledge of Him. This lesson is for all today.

4. Although Satan was compassing the death of Christ in order to destroy the "Seed of Abraham," and so make God's Word of no effect (Rom. 9:6), yet the death of the "Seed" would prove not only its restoration, but the multiplication of it. Gal. 3:29. Like the kernel of wheat, if He die, instead of abiding alone, He would cause the "seed of Abraham" to abound everywhere, by drawing all to Himself.
