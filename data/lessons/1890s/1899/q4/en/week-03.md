## NOTES

1. Jesus knew before reaching the tree that it bore no figs. But its outward appearance, by having leaves in advance of other trees, proclaimed that it did have fruit on, although the time of figs was not yet come. The tree had a designed purpose,â€”that of bearing fruit. By not doing so, it transgressed the law of its being while presenting a boastful and deceitful show of superiority over its neighbor trees. By this it had forfeited its place in creation, and so by the word which produced it, the penalty of removal was pronounced. This fitly represented the Jews of that day, as well as professed Christians of today, who claim to have more light and truth than others. God had borne with the Jews many years, but as in the parable in Luke 13:6-9, the time was present when it was proper to say, "Cut it down." So it will be with all who do not meet the design of their being.

2. Three years before, at the beginning of His ministry, Christ had done the same thing, but apparently with little lasting effect, for the same abuse had been restored. Had the first cleansing been regarded, the fig tree would have borne fruit, and no place would have been found for the second cleansing. But before being put to death, Christ had a public work to do in the very court of the temple, in order to confirm before all the people His Messiahship, and as He could not do this in the midst of wicked desecration, this cleansing was first necessary.

3. For hours Christ held the court of the temple unchallenged for healing purposes. He had wrought many miracles in Jerusalem before, but never so publicly, and within the temple itself. What a change from the earthly traffic of the day, to the healing of the afflicted, and the precious teaching of the world's Redeemer. Why may we not have the same change in the temple of our bodies?
