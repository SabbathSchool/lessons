## NOTES

1. Evidently some thought that the disappearance of Christ from the Passover would raise questions of His whereabouts that could not be satisfactorily answered. Suspicions would then be whispered about that the elders had put Christ to death secretly, which would forever destroy their power over the people, because such an act would be evidence to all that nothing but malicious hate on the part of the authorities had been the cause of His death. Therefore, to save their reputation with the people it was necessary to trump up some charge by which His death might be compassed with a show of legality, and in a public manner. Thus the odium of His death, if any should exist, would be made to rest on the civil power.

2. How great must have been Judas' hardness of heart in order, afterward, to look the Saviour in the face, and call Him Master, in common with the other disciples. He either never had faith in the Lord's infinite power of discernment, or had permitted himself to be drawn into the darkest condition of mind possible.
