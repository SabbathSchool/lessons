## NOTE

There were two reasons why the parents of Jesus took Him to Jerusalem at this time. The Mosaic law required an offering of every mother, at the end of her days of purification. When she was in circumstances to permit it, this was to consist of a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering. But when parents were too poor to provide a lamb, the law was satisfied with simply a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. The fact that Christ's parents offered only the latter shows that they were in the deepest poverty. Again, the law required that a first-born son should be redeemed by a fixed sum, and this requirement must be fulfilled by the parents of our Lord, since He was Mary's first-born.
