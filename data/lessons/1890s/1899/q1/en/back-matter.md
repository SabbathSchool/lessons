### OLD KING TIME

With his much-worn scythe will soon open the year 1899 for the Signs of the Times to enter upon a most important epoch in its history. The crisis of the world is here. The issues of eternity are upon us. The last great acts of the nations are already being outlined above the horizon.

The editors and contributors of the Signs of the Times are carefully studying the situation, and are keeping the readers of their paper fully informed and up to date in reference to it.

During 1899 we will add to our force of writers a number of regular contributors of long experience in journalism and who are watchmen faithful at their post of duty, ready, to give the trumpet of warning the certain sound. This feature alone will add much to the value of the Signs during 1899.

Five special numbers have already been planned to come out during the year. These should not be missed by any, and should have a wide and general circulation outside of our regular list of readers.

Our new premium list will be sent free on application. Write for it if you have not seen it. Then send us an order. If you are a subscriber, show it to your friends and thus put to use the light God is giving through this messenger. They will want the Signs and one of the premiums. If you will help us in extending our circulation, write also for our terms to agents.

## Coming Publications

### Heralds of the Morning

Such is the title of a book we are preparing for the canvassing season of 1899.

Its whole object is to arouse people to the fact that Christ is soon coming.

To prove this, the author, Elder A. O. Tait, refers to signs which may be observed daily, and which will therefore appeal to everyone at a glance.

#### Allow us to read a few Chapter Titles

These chapters are based on scriptures that compare the last days with those of Noah and Lot, and contain some startling statements concerning the depth of vice and crime into which our world has fallen.

- THE PREVALENCE OF CRIME A SIGN OF OUR TIMES
- THE EARTH IS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE
- THE SOCIAL VICE
- THE GREAT DECEPTION

"YE HAVE HEAPED TREASURE TOGETHER FOR THE LAST DAYS" is the title of a chapter devoted to the labor question. This chapter will contain some thirty illustrations showing scenes in sweat shops, in slums, tenement houses, etc., etc.

The one chapter entitled "Judgment is Turned Away Backward" contains enough in itself to undeceive anyone who thinks the world is growing better.

Many others might be mentioned, such as "The Nations Are Angry," "Voice of the Elements," "Testimony of the Earth," etc., etc., but they all have the same aim—that of calling attention to the signs of our times.

The illustrations are original, and strikingly illustrate the thoughts of the author.

At this writing (Oct. 1) we can not tell how large a book it will make, nor just when it will be ready, but we think the price will not exceed $1.50, and that it will be published early in 1899.

One thing we can say, however, and that is that "Heralds of the Morning" will come as near selling itself as any book we have ever published; because the signs of which it treats are growing daily more apparent.

By the time this notice gets to you we will probably know the exact date of publication. Please write for it.
