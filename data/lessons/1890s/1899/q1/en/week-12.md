## NOTES

1. The hot climate of that country made a drink of water of so much value that under ordinary circumstances no one would think of refusing it. But continued strife for centuries between the Jews and Samaritans had created a most bitter and permanent hatred between the two sections. In the first place, the Samaritans were made up of people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, taken there by the king of Assyria when he carried the ten tribes of Israel into captivity. A few stragglers, also, from the ten tribes found their way back again to their native land. For certain reasons, the king of Assyria returned one of the exiled priests to that land, who taught the people the worship of Jehovah, which they added to their own worship of idols. 2 Kings 17:24-33. When the tribe of Judah returned from its captivity, these people desired to join with them in building the temple at Jerusalem, which was refused. The Samaritans in consequence built a rival temple at Mount Gerizim. Eternal enmity sprang up; greater holiness was claimed for Mount Gerizim than for Jerusalem; the Samaritans accused the Jews of corrupting God's Word. On the other hand, the Jews called the Samaritans Cuthites, and forbade all intercourse with them; to receive one into the house was to bring down the curse of God.

2. Note how carefully the Saviour led the mind of the woman, not only to voluntarily confess her sinfulness, but to ask questions for the enlightenment of her darkened mind. He precipitated nothing, but let her open the way for the line of truth she sought to receive. A worthy lesson for many now who would make assertions people are not prepared to receive.

3. The relations of the sexes in that day, even in common life, were very narrow and suspicious among the Jews. An unveiled woman in public was counted immodest. For a rabbi to speak to a woman publicly was highly indecent. The Talmud forbade it, even though the woman was the rabbi's own wife. He could not even greet her courteously. The disciples, however, dared not question the act of their Master, even though the woman with whom He talked was a hated Samaritan sinner. He went so far over the bounds of prescribed custom as to conclusively show that true religion recognized no social difference between the sexes. In Christ all are one.
