## NOTES

1. The Jews recognized two forms of the Passover. The first was observed in the wilderness, on the journey from Egypt to Palestine, and for some time later. After the building of the temple, however, the form of celebration was materially changed. By comparing Deut. 16:1-6 and Num. 28:16-25 with Exodus, chapters 12, 13, it will be seen that injunctions regarding it were added in the later scriptures which were not in the former, and which were hardly possible to be carried out in the wilderness. In the later observances of the ordinances wine was used, but it was not enjoined in the Pentateuch. It is, however, mentioned in the New Testament. Luke 22:17-20; 1 Cor. 10:16. The song with which the Saviour closed the last Passover service was not required by the original instructions. The song, called the Hallel, was comprised of Psalms 113-118, the first two being sung at the beginning of the meal, and the others at the close.

2. This was the first cleansing of the temple, in the early part of Christ's ministry. The cleansing of the temple was repeated at the last Passover which He attended, three years later.

3. At each Passover every male, whether rich or poor, must bring his half shekel to the sanctuary, as a sacred tribute to be applied to the expenses of the tabernacle service. Ex. 30:11-16. But the money of the various countries, of brass or copper, bearing heathen symbols and inscriptions, was not allowed in the temple. The worshipers coming from these countries were obliged to exchange their heathen coin for the usual silver piece of the sanctuary, and these money-changers did this service for them, charging a heavy rate per cent for the favor. This caused much haggling over money values, and, with the bleating of sheep and the lowing of cattle, the babel of voices made the temple court a scene of much confusion. The disciples had before witnessed this profanation of the house of prayer, but probably had not before stopped to think it wrong, since this arrangement had been the custom for many years. But seeing in Christ's act a fulfilment of prophecy, their faith in Him was greatly strengthened. See "Desire of Ages," p. 155.

4. That is to say, Jesus received none of these into the circle of His personal followers. No one from about Jerusalem, in fact, was to be thus privileged. He chose no scribes, no rabbis, no men of high standing from that region. On the other hand, His disciples, to whom He committed Himself to the end of His life, with the single exception of Judas, were Galileans. Knowing what was in all men, He knew whom to choose for the successful issue of His earthly work.
