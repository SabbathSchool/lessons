## NOTES

1. But the question was not asked for lack of other thoughts. The two inquirers wanted more than a passing word with the newly-found Being, and so desired to spend time with Him in the privacy of His home. He, divining their wish, readily opened the way for an extended interview.

2. The place to which they went was some home which had been opened to Christ for a few days' sojourn, by the hospitality of strangers. How strangely the mission of Christ opened. He did not make any demonstration; no public harangues were given by Him. But as He quietly walked before the people, His first disciples were drawn to Him by the quiet words of another.

3. "Messiah" means anointed, and was used with reference to any one anointed with the holy oil. Christ was the antitype of all those Hebrew anointings, and was therefore the "consolation" to which every true Israelite looked forward. Luke 2:25. The word "consolation" there used comes from the same original as "Comforter" in John 14:16; 15:26, etc., and means a calling alongside for help. In other words, the Jewish consolation consisted in calling to their very side the help which their blood-offerings typified.

4. "Jona" in Hebrew means a dove. As though Jesus had ever known Simon, He called him the "son of a dove," and then with divine foresight as to the developments of Peter's future, added, "Thou shalt be called Cephas," that is, a stone. It will be noticed that this change of name for the impulsive apostle was bestowed at the very first meeting of Peter with his Lord, and before any other words had passed between them. The name "Peter," by which this disciple is most commonly known, is the Aramaic and Greek equivalents of Cephas, or stone.

5. "Under the fig tree." The chosen place for meditation and prayer with the devout of Israel. Philip had been in devotion under the fig tree, pondering over the very truths he had heard at Bethabara, when listening to the words of the Baptist, and wondering, like many others, when and where the Messiah would appear. He came to Christ doubting, but with a guileless heart. Christ's words to him seemed so full of divine prescience that he could not help believing that One was before him who knew his very thoughts. He was by this deeply impressed that the desire of his heart had become the sight of his eyes, and his doubt gave way to the sincerest faith. It has been supposed by some that, inasmuch as the name Nathanael does not appear in the list of the twelve apostles, he was identical with Bartholomew, who is always named next to Philip.

These five were Christ's first disciples. He called but one of them direct; two were prompted to unite their interests to His by the words of John; one of them joined the company at the instance of a brother; and the other, by the solicitation of a friend. It was all done by direct, individual work, the efforts which God blesses above all others to the salvation of men.
