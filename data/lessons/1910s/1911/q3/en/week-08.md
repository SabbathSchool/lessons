### Notes

1. "Corinth, the capital of Achaia, was one of the most famous cities of Greece. It was beautifully situated on an isthmus, which connects the peninsula of Morea with the Greek mainland. In the rear of the city was a rocky mountain, called Acro-Corinth, rising abruptly to the height of 2,000 feet, upon the summit of which was a temple of Venus. Corinth had two seaports, Cenchrea, on the Gulf of Aegina, and Lechaeum, on the Gulf of Corinth. Through these important commercial routes it gained great wealth and influence, but its immorality was notorious even in the heathen world. Destroyed by the Romans, B.C. 146, it was restored and rebuilt by Julius Caesar, and regained much of its former splendor and prosperity. Paul visited Corinth three times. About A.D. 53 he spent a year and a half here, during which time he probably wrote the two epistles to the Thessalonians (Acts 18:11); then between 54 and 57 (1 Cor. 16:7; 2 Cor. 12:13, 14; 13:1), and the three winter months from 57 to 58, during which he wrote the epistle to the Romans. (Acts 20:2, 3; comp. 1 Cor. 16:6; Rom. 16:1.) He wrote two epistles to the Christians at Corinth. The site of this once proud and dissolute city is now occupied by the miserable little village of Gortho." — "Cyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," page 218.

"Corinth gave birth to painting; the most elaborate order of architecture received from her its name, the finest bronze was the 'Corinthian brass,' although none of her sons are mentioned among the illustrious writers of Greece." — Quoted in "Peloubet's Notes," 1897.

2. Aquila and Priscilla were refugees from Rome, having fled from Italy to the Grecian metropolis after the decree of Claudius in A.D. 52, expelling all the Jews from Rome. These two persons accepted the gospel message from Paul, and on his leaving Corinth when returning to Syria, they accompanied him as far as Ephesus. We find them at this place when Paul wrote his first letter to the Corinthian church (see 1 Cor. 16:19); but from Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 16:3, we see that they later returned to Rome, where their house was a place of meeting for the company of believers. Their devotion to the gospel is indicated by verse 4, — "Who have for my life laid down their own necks."

3. "Paul was highly educated, and was admired for his genius and eloquence. He was chosen by his countrymen as a member of the Sanhedrin, and was a rabbi of distinguished ability; yet his education had not been considered complete, until he had served an apprenticeship at some useful trade. He rejoiced that he was able to support himself by manual labor, and frequently declared that his own hands had ministered to his necessities. While in a city of strangers, he would not be chargeable to any one. When his means had been expended to advance the cause of Christ, he resorted to his trade in order to gain a livelihood." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 100.

"There were certain circumstances at Thessalonica, and above all at Corinth, which made St. Paul waive his just claim, and even cramp, limit, and confine his exertions, by imposing on himself the work of earning his daily food. Thessalonica and Corinth had immense Jewish populations. The Jews were notorious in that age as furnishing the greatest number of impostors, quack magicians and every other kind of agency which traded upon human credulity for the purposes of gain. St. Paul was determined that neither Jew nor Gentile in either place should be able to hinder the work of the gospel by accusing him of self-seeking or covetous purposes. For this purpose he united with Aquila and Priscilla in working at their common trade as tent-makers." — "The Expositor's Bible" (Acts), by Stokes, volume 2, pages 323, 324.

4. "One of the proconsuls who were sent out to govern the province of Achaia in the course of Paul's second missionary journey was Gallio. His original name was Annaeus Novatus, and he was the brother of Annaeus Seneca the philosopher. The name under which he is known to us in sacred and secular history was due to his adoption into the family of Junius Gallio the rhetorician." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 342.
