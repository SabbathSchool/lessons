### Notes

1. "Day after day, as they went to their devotions, a woman with the spirit of divination followed them, crying, 'These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.' This woman was a special agent of Satan; and, as the devils were troubled by the presence of Christ, so the evil spirit which possessed her was ill at ease in the presence of the apostles. ... The words of recommendation uttered by this woman were an injury to the cause, distracting the minds of the people from the truths presented to them, and throwing disrepute upon the work by causing people to believe that the men who spoke with the Spirit and power of God were actuated by the same spirit as this emissary of Satan." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 74.

2. When Jesus sent His servants to preach the gospel to all nations, He said: "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore;" and He said further, "Lo, I am with you alway." So these heralds of the gospel, acting under the great commission, worked in the name of Him who had promised to give them power for every crisis. Matt. 28:18-20; 16:18.

3. "The apostles endured this opposition for several days; then Paul, under inspiration of the Spirit of God, commanded the evil spirit to leave the woman. Satan was thus met and rebuked. The immediate and continued silence of the woman testified that the apostles were the servants of God, and that the demon had acknowledged them to be such, and had obeyed their command." — Id., page 74.

4. What a duet was this! These Roman prisons "were pestilential cells, damp and cold, from which the light was excluded, and where the chains rusted on the limbs of the prisoners." Here, tortured by stocks, lacerated and bleeding from their terrible scourging, instead of murmuring or complaining, they prayed and sang songs of thanksgiving to God. What a beautiful lesson of trust is here presented!

5. "The earthquake was not a mere coincidence. There was more here. Earthquakes do not throw all bolted doors open, and unclasp fetters and chains. God was here. He was breaking a way for His gospel to the heart of heathendom. But His mercy followed close in the heavy steps of His power. The jailer, like a true Roman, was about to execute himself for the loss of his prisoners, as he supposed. Paul arrests the attempt. The marvelous story of his conversion follows." — "Introduction to the Book of Acts," Stiller, pages 157, 158.

6. The jailer "had trembled because of the wrath of God expressed in the earthquake. ... He saw his own deplorable condition in contrast with that of the disciples, and with deep humility and reverence asked them to show him the way of life." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 78.

7. The following note is a valuable testimony from a recognized Episcopalian authority. However, the suggestion which he makes, that there might have been "exceptional cases," we know to be unwarranted by the Scriptures:

"It is needless to add that baptism was (unless in exceptional cases) administered by immersion, the convert being plunged beneath the surface of the water to represent his death to the life of sin, and then raised from this momentary burial to represent his resurrection to the life of righteousness. It must be a subject of regret that the general discontinuance of this original form of baptism ... has rendered obscure to popular apprehension some very important passages of Scripture." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 361.

8. "Paul and Silas felt that to maintain the dignity of Christ's church, they must not submit to the illegal course proposed by the Roman magistrates. The apostles were Roman citizens, and it was unlawful to scourge a Roman save for the most flagrant crime, or to deprive him of his liberty without a fair trial and condemnation. ... When this word was brought to the authorities, they were alarmed for fear the apostles would make complaint of their unlawful treatment to the emperor, and cause the magistrates to lose their positions. They accordingly visited the prison, apologized to the apostles for their injustice and cruelty, and themselves conducted them out of the prison, and entreated them to depart out of the city. Thus the Lord wrought for His servants in their extremity." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 79.
