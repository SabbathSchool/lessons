### Notes

1. By this text (1 Cor. 16:2) it will be seen that every disciple has been made a treasurer for God. The Lord places the responsibility upon each believer to render back to Him (1) the tithe — which has never been given man; (2) offerings; both of which are subject to the expression "as God hath prospered him." To ascertain "how God hath prospered him" requires an examination into his private business affairs. No one can do this for another, as it would require the turning over of personal business matters for examination. Therefore each church-member actually becomes a treasurer for God. This reveals great confidence on the part of God. He voluntarily puts the financial interests of His own kingdom in the earth into our hands. He leaves it to us to count out from our own purses that portion belonging to Him. Surely in a case of this kind it behooves every one to be strictly honest. And it is possible that much more is involved in this than many suppose. Some have proved untrue to this confidence reposed in them by the Lord, and with results quite disastrous. Among these might be mentioned Achan, Ananias and Sapphira, and Judas. Rom. 14:12.

2. "Voluntary offerings and the tithe constitute the revenue of the gospel. Of the means which are entrusted to man, God claims a certain portion, — a tithe; but He leaves all free to say how much the tithe is, and whether or not they will give more than this. They are to give as they purpose in their hearts." — "Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, page 149.

3. "God has given special direction as to the use of the tithe. He does not design that His work shall be crippled for want of means. That there may be no haphazard work and no error, He has made our duty on these points very plain. The portion that God has reserved for Himself is not to be diverted to any other purpose than that which He has specified. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to use according to their own judgment. They are not to use it for themselves in an emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit, even in what they may regard as the Lord's work." — Id., volume 9, page 247.

4. "The hearts of men become hardened through selfishness, and like Ananias and Sapphira, they are tempted to withhold part of the price, while pretending to come up to the rules of tithing. Will a man rob God? Should means flow into the treasury exactly according to God's plan, — a tenth of all the increase, — there would be abundance to carry forward His work. 'Well,' says one, 'the calls keep coming to give to the cause. I am weary of giving.' Are you? Then let me ask, Are you weary of receiving from God's beneficent hand? Not until He ceases to bless you, will you cease to be under bonds to return to Him the portion He claims." — Id., volume 5, page 150.

5. "Not grudgingly." This spirit in the heart reveals that the giver has lost sight of the essential in the gospel plan of redemption. He fails to view Calvary. The things of earth are become of greater value than the heavenly. God is not glorified by such forced gifts. Such hearts need reconversion. But the cheerful giver reveals a heart overflowing with love for his blessed Redeemer, who gave up a royal home, and for our sakes became poor. "Not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
