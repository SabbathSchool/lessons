### Notes

1. "Paul had directed Titus, on his return from Corinth, to rejoin him at Troas, and he awaited the coming of this beloved fellow laborer, hoping to receive some tidings from the Corinthian church. But week after week passed, and Titus came not. The apostle's solicitude became almost unsupportable. He says, 'My spirit found no rest, because of Titus, my brother.' He left Troas, and went to Philippi, where he met Timothy. 

"A deep sadness still rested upon the mind and heart of Paul because of his apprehensions concerning the Corinthian church. While at Philippi, he commenced his second epistle to them; for they hung as a heavy weight upon his soul. ...

"Paul's burden because of the Corinthians did not leave him until he reached Macedonia, where he met Titus. He states: 'Our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. Nevertheless, God that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus.' The report of this faithful messenger greatly relieved the mind of Paul. Titus assured him that the greater part of the church at Corinth had submitted to the injunctions of the apostle, and had given proof of the deepest repentance for the sins that had brought a reproach upon Christianity. ...

"In his second epistle to the church, the apostle expressed his joy at the good work which had been wrought in them: 'Though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent' — when tortured with fear that his words would be despised, and half regretting that he had written so decidedly and severely." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 173-177.

2. "From Macedonia, perhaps from Philippi, he wrote the second epistle to the Corinthians, which he soon followed in person. From Corinth he wrote his epistle to the Romans, in order to prepare the brethren of Rome for his personal preaching. Phoebe, the deaconess, was probably the bearer of the letter. But before going to Rome he visits Jerusalem." — "Concise Cyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," page 715.

"In the autumn he [Paul] went to Greece, and spent three months there, chiefly in Corinth, where he had much to do amid sickness and afflictions on every side, 'fightings without and fears within' (2 Cor. 4:7-11; 7:5, 6), in caring for all the churches (2 Cor. 11:28), and correcting wrong conduct (2 Cor. 12:20, 21; 13:1, 2). It was four or five years since he had left them after a stay of a year and a half." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1909.

3. "Paul was accompanied to Corinth by a little band of fellow laborers, some of whom had been his companions during the months spent in Macedonia, and his assistants in gathering funds for the church at Jerusalem. He could rely upon these brethren for sympathy and support in the present crisis." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 186.

4. "The passage from Philippi was hindered by contrary winds, so that five days instead of two, the usual time, were required to reach Troas. Here Paul remained seven days, and as was his custom, improved the opportunity to encourage and strengthen the believers." — Id., page 196.

5. That this was an evening meeting is clear from the fact that there were "many lights in the upper chamber," and that Paul talked "till break of day."

"The labors of the early days of the week that was spent at Troas are not related to us, but concerning the last day we have a narrative which enters into details with all the minuteness of one of the gospel histories. It was the evening which succeeded the Jewish Sabbath." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 530.

"The meeting was held on what we should call Saturday evening; but we must remember that the Jewish first day began from sundown on Saturday or the Sabbath." — "The Expositor's Bible" (Acts), volume 2, page 393.

6. "As Jesus had once said of the young maiden who was taken by death from the society of her friends, 'She is not dead, but sleepeth,' so the apostle of Jesus received power to restore the dead to life. He went down and fell upon the body like Elisha of old, and, embracing Eutychus, said to the bystanders, 'Do not lament, for his life is in him.'" — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 521.

7. "But the time came when Paul too must depart. The vessel might arrive at Assos before him, and, whatever influence he might have with the seamen, he could not count on any long delay. ...

"The discomfort of a crowded ship is unfavorable for devotion, and prayer and meditation are necessary for maintaining the religious life even of an apostle. That Saviour to whose service he was devoted had often prayed in solitude on the mountain and crossed the brook Kedron to kneel under the olives of Gethsemane. And strength and peace were surely sought and obtained by the apostle from the Redeemer as he pursued his lonely road that Sunday afternoon in spring among the oak woods and the streams of Ida." — Id., pages 521, 522.

8. "That he should wish to reach Jerusalem in time for Pentecost is natural enough, for there was a peculiar fitness in offering his collection to the church at Jerusalem on that occasion. It was the harvest feast, and it brought to Jerusalem a larger number of foreign Jews than any other festival, so that the relation between Palestine and the rest of the world received then special emphasis. Paul might well fear that a visit to Ephesus, where he had so many friends, and very likely enemies as well, would demand more time than he could afford under the circumstances, possibly compelling him to wait for another ship." — "The Apostolic Age," McGiffert, page 339.
