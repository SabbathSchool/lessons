### Notes

1. Thessalonica was "a maritime city of Macedonia; originally named Therma, and situated on the Thermaic Gulf, now a gulf of Salonica. The city rose in importance with the decay of Greek nationality. Cassander, the son of Antipater, rebuilt and enlarged it, and named it after his wife Thessalonica, the sister of Alexander the Great, whose name commemorated in Greek a victory over the Thessalians which her father (Philip I), obtained on the day when he heard of her birth. ... The name, ever since, under very slight modifications, has been continuous, and the city has never ceased to be eminent. It is now known as Saloniki or Salonica, and is still the most important town of European Turkey, next after Constantinople." — "Smith's Dictionary of the Bible," article Thessalonica.

2. "Timotheus seems to have rejoined Paul and Silas, if not at Thessalonica, at least at Berea (Acts 17:14). But we do not see Luke again in the apostle's company till the third missionary journey and the second visit to Macedonia (Acts 20:4-6). At this exact point of separation we observe that he drops the style of an eye-witness and resumes that of a historian until the second time of meeting, after which he writes as an eye-witness till the arrival at Rome and the very close of the Acts. To explain and justify the remark here made, we need only ask the reader to contrast the detailed narrative of events at Philippi with the more general account of what happened at Thessalonica." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 262.

3. The question at that time, which pre-eminently involved man's eternal destiny, was whether the One who had attracted so much attention in Galilee was indeed the Messiah foretold by the holy prophets. To make clear to the people that the man of Nazareth was indeed the Christ, was the first effort of the apostles.

4. "The result [of Paul's work in Berea] was that many Jews believed, as well as Greeks — men and women of the more respectable classes. They [the apostles] must have spent some weeks of calm among these open-minded Bereans. ... But it would have been too much to hope that all should be thus open to conviction, and the news was soon unfavorably reported to the synagogue at Thessalonica. The hated name of Paul acted like a spark on their inflammable rage, and they instantly despatched emissaries to stir up storms among the mob of Berea. ... It was impossible to face this persistent and organized outburst of hatred which was now pursuing him from city to city. And since it was clear that Paul, and not Silas, was the main object of persecution, it was arranged that, while Paul made good his escape, Silas and Timothy ... should stay to set in order all that was wanting, and water the good seed which had begun to spring." — Farrar's "Life of St. Paul," pages 293, 294.
