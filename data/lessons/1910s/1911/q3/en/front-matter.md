# Sabbath-School Lessons on the Book of Acts
## For the Third Quarter, 1911

### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

This quarter's lessons are a further study of the missionary labors of the apostle Paul. These lessons should be so faithfully studied that each member of the Sabbath-school will get a clear grasp of the apostle's movements. But of greater value will be the study of the methods of labor employed, the tact shown, the unselfish devotion seen, the dauntless courage manifested, the obstacles surmounted, the victories gained, the special blessing of God that rested upon His servants in their work, and His manifestation of power given as evidence of divine approbation: "God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will." Heb. 2:4.

The travels of Paul and the other evangelists should be carefully traced on the map. Consult Bible dictionaries and atlases for information concerning the places visited. The "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," by Conybeare and Howson, is a recognized authority, and is an excellent help on these lessons. It is a valuable work for the library.

Just a word concerning dates. A few dates are given in the notes in connection with Paul's missionary journeys; also the time suggested when some of his epistles were written. As there is disagreement among reliable authorities as to the date of some of these events, no time should be spent in debate over the matter. The dates given are from what is regarded as good authority, and will be helpful to many in determining at least approximately when certain events occurred.
