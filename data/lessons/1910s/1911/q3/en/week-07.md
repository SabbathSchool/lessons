### Notes

1. Driven from Berea, Paul came to Athens in Greece. The city of Athens was famed for its architecture and art, and for the education and intelligence of its people. But the darkness of heathenism enshrouded all. Statues of gods and deified heroes of history and poetry were to be seen in every direction. The city was filled with altars and idols, and there were costly temples and sanctuaries on every hand. The Athenians boasted of their religion; but it was of no value, because they knew nothing of the true God. It did not satisfy the needs of their soul; and one altar in the city was dedicated "to the unknown God." The great men of the place delighted to engage in discussion, that they might display their wisdom and oratory.

"Philosophers of the Epicureans" were disciples of Epicurus, a famous teacher. They believed that the true object in life should be to obtain pleasure, enjoyment, the indulgence of the senses and appetite.

The Stoics were indifferent alike to pain and pleasure. They condemned the worship of images, and believed that the many heathen gods were partial developments of the great "world-god." They believed that deity and man alike were subjects of fate.

2. "The great men of the city seemed hungering for subjects of discussion, in which they would have opportunity to display their wisdom and oratory. While waiting for Silas and Timothy to meet him, Paul was not idle. 'He disputed in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.' The great men of Athens were not long in finding out this singular teacher, who presented to the people doctrines so new and strange." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 91.

3. The Areopagus "was a famous meeting place in Athens, and gave its name to the great council of the city which met there. It was situated west of the Acropolis and on a ridge of reddish limestone rock sloping downward on the west, but abrupt on the east, north, and south. A short flight of sixteen steps cut in the rock led to the quadrangle on the top, about twenty-four paces north and south and sixty paces east and west. There were benches cut in the stone on three sides of this square place, which was rudely divided into two or three smaller compartments. From this point the apostle could see the temple of Theseus on the north, the Acropolis on the east with the great Parthenon, and the statues, temples, and altars on every side of him. The Areopagus refers to the place rather than to the court held there." — Abbreviated from "People's Commentary," Rice, "Acts," pages 225, 226.

4. Instead of the word "superstitious," the Revised Version gives "religious" in the margin. "Conybeare and Howson" so translate the text, and in a foot-note add: "The mistranslation of this verse in the Authorized Version is much to be regretted, because it entirely destroys the graceful courtesy of St. Paul's opening address, and represents him as beginning his speech by offending his audience."

5. The relation of Jehovah to all things, as Creator, and His exalted character and holiness, should engage the thought of those who profess to worship Him, far more than it does, thus leading to a worship that is "in spirit and in truth." The object of the Sabbath institution is to inculcate the highest ideals of our Maker and to foster reverence for Him. The great truth preached to the Athenians is a primary truth in the "everlasting gospel" now, as it always has been. Rev. 14:6, 7.

6. This appeal to men everywhere to repent is now more solemn than in the past, in view of the fact that the judgment "IS COME." The tendency of men is to lapse into recklessness, and to abandon themselves to sin. See Eccl. 8:11. So the gospel herald must urge upon the world the great restraining truth that judgment is certain. This is one office of the Holy Spirit. 2 Cor. 5:10; John 16:7, 8.

7. Hales, in his chronology, speaking concerning the darkening of the sun at the cross, makes the following interesting statement concerning Dionysius:

"This obscuration of the sun must have been preternatural, in its extent, duration, and opposition of the moon at full to the sun. It was observed at Heliopolis, in Egypt, by Dionysius, the Areopagite, afterwards the illustrious convert of Paul at Athens (Acts 17:34), who, in a letter to the martyr Polycarp, describes his own and his companion's — the sophist Apollophanes — astonishment at the phenomenon, when they saw the darkness commence at the eastern brink of the sun, and proceed to the western, till the whole was eclipsed; and then retrograde, from the western to the eastern, till his light was fully restored; which they attributed to the miraculous passage of the moon across the sun's disk. Apollophanes exclaimed, as if divining the cause, 'These, O good Dionysius, are the vicissitudes of divine events!' Dionysius answered, 'Either the Deity suffers, or He sympathizes with the sufferer.' And that sufferer, according to tradition recorded by Michael Syncellus, of Jerusalem, he declared to be 'the Unknowable God,' for whose sufferings all nature was darkened and convulsed." — "Hales," volume C, page 897, quoted in "Sacred Chronology," page 133.
