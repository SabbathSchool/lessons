### Notes

1. "The first epistle to the Corinthians was written by the apostle Paul during the latter part of his stay in Ephesus [about 57 A.D.]. ...

"A letter was sent to Paul by the church, revealing nothing of the enormous sins that existed among them. ... He was, however, forcibly impressed by the Holy Spirit, that the true state of the church had been concealed, and that this letter was an attempt to draw from him statements which the writers could construe to serve their own purposes. There had come to Ephesus about this time several members of the household of Chloe, a Christian family of high repute in Corinth. In answer to the questions of the apostle, these brethren reluctantly gave him a statement of facts as they existed. The church was rent in factions; the dissensions that arose at the time of Apollos' visit had greatly increased. False teachers were leading the brethren to despise the instructions of Paul. The doctrines and the ordinances of the gospel had been perverted. Pride, idolatry, and sensualism were steadily increasing among those who had once been disciples of Christ.

"The apostle's worst fears were more than realized. ... He sent Titus to Corinth to inform them of his change of plans, and to do what he could to correct the existing evils. Then, summoning all the courage of his nature, and keeping his soul stayed upon God, ... and throwing his whole soul into the work, he dictated to the faithful Sosthenes one of the richest, most instructive, and most powerful of his letters, — the first extant epistle to the Corinthians." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 149-151.

2. "The temple of Diana, one of the wonders of the world, and which was 220 years in building, and erected at the joint cost of all Asia, stood without the walls, at some little distance to the northeast, and being constructed of the purest marble, is said to have gleamed like a meteor to the gaze of the approaching mariner. It was built upon marshy ground, and the foundations were laid at a vast expense. The first superstructure, or basement, was ascended by a grand flight of fourteen steps, and upon this platform was erected the temple, facing the east, 425 feet long, and 220 broad, and supported by columns of Parian marble, 60 feet high, of which 36 were beautifully carved.

"The building was of the Ionic order. Its porticoes consisted each of 32 columns, eight abreast, and four deep, and around the sides were two rows of columns. In the center of the court or hall is the shrine, containing the image of the goddess. We enter, and the roof, which is of cedar, is supported by a row, on each side, of four columns of green jasper. In front of us is the altar, rich with the carvings of Praxiteles, and beyond it hangs from the ceiling the purple embroidered veil screening the image that all the world worshipeth — a wooden image so time-worn that whether the material be pine, or cedar, or ebony, the nearest examination can not discover. Whence it came or by whom it was shaped is a mystery, but the common belief is that it fell from heaven." — Abbreviated from "Life of St. Paul," Lewin, volume 1, pages 323-326.

3. "The month of May was specially dedicated to the goddess of Ephesus, and was called from her the Artemisian. During the month was held the great fair — called Ephesia — which attracted an immense concourse of people from all parts of Asia, and was kept with all possible splendor and revelry. The gods were personated by chosen representatives, who received throughout the month a sort of mock adoration.

"The theater and stadium were densely crowded by festive throngs to listen to the musical contest, to watch the horse-races and the athletic exhibitions, or to look on with thrills of fiercer emotion at the horrible combats of men and beasts. The vast expense of these prolonged festivities and superb spectacles was entirely borne by the ten Asiarchs. They were men of high distinction, chosen annually from the wealthiest citizens of the chief cities of Asia, and it was their duty to preside over the games and to keep order in the theater. Their names were recorded on coins and in public inscriptions, and the garlands and the purple robes which distinguished them during the continuance of the feast were the external marks of the popular gratitude." — Abbreviated from Farrar's "Life of St. Paul," pages 369, 370.

4. "Paul informed the Corinthians of his trouble in Asia, where, he says, 'We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life.' In his first epistle he speaks of fighting with beasts at Ephesus. He thus refers to the fanatical mob that clamored for his life. They were indeed more like furious wild beasts than men. With gratitude to God, Paul reviews his danger and his deliverance. He had thought when at Ephesus, that his life of usefulness was about to close, that the promise made to him that he should at last die for his faith, was about to be fulfilled. But God had preserved him, and his remarkable deliverance made him hope that his labors were not at an end." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 178.
