### Notes

1. "James presided at the council, and his final decision was, 'Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God!' This ended the discussion. In this instance we have a refutation of the doctrine held by the Roman Catholic Church — that Peter was the head of the church. Those who, as popes, have claimed to be his successors, have no foundation for their pretensions. Nothing in the life of Peter gives sanction to those pretended claims. If the professed successors of Peter had imitated his example, they would have taken no authoritative position, but one on an equality with that of their brethren." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 68, 69.

2. "The substance of what he [James] said was (1) that the conversion of the Gentiles, as rehearsed by Simon (Peter's Hebrew name), was an exact fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, the particular prediction cited being taken from Amos 9:11, 12; and (2) that, that being so, the conversion of the Gentiles manifestly had a place in the plan and purpose of God, to whom all His works are known from the beginning, so that nothing could occur by accident." — "Homiletical Commentary," page 302.

This allusion to the rebuilding of the house of David that "is fallen," as spoken by Amos, is especially interesting, showing, as it does, that the real true house of David, or the true Israel, are those of all nations who become one with Christ by faith. See Gal. 3:29; Eph. 2:11-13; Hosea 2:23; Rom. 9:25, 26.

3. "The council which decided this case was composed of the founders of the Jewish and Gentile Christian churches. Elders from Jerusalem, and deputies from Antioch, were present; and the most influential churches were represented. The council did not claim infallibility in their deliberations, but moved from the dictates of enlightened judgment, and with the dignity of a church established by the divine will. They saw that God Himself had decided this question by favoring the Gentiles with the Holy Ghost; and it was left for them to follow the guidance of the Spirit.

"The entire body of Christians were not called to vote upon the question. The apostles and elders — men of influence and judgment — framed and issued the decree, which was thereupon generally accepted by the Christian churches. All were not pleased, however, with this decision; there was a faction of false brethren who assumed to engage in a work on their own responsibility. They indulged in murmuring and fault-finding, proposing new plans, and seeking to pull down the work of the experienced men whom God had ordained to teach the doctrine of Christ. The church has had such obstacles to meet from the first, and will ever have them to the close of time." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 70, 71.

The Gentiles worshiped idols, and made sacrifices to them. Their priests then sold the animals that were brought to them as offerings, and the people ate them. They also ate the flesh of animals that had been strangled, and they drank blood, and used it in their food. The Jews had been divinely instructed with regard to the food they should use in order to preserve their health and strength. While merely ceremonial observances were no longer to be followed, it was just as wrong for Gentiles as for Jews to partake of those things which God had declared unclean and unfit for food.
