### Notes

1. One striking characteristic of Paul's labors was his watchfulness over those whom he brought to Christ by his ministry. Not content with having raised up a church, or secured converts to the faith, he "ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears" so that he might "present every man perfect in Christ Jesus." See Acts 20:31; Col. 1:28; 2 Cor. 11:2. Gospel workers now may very profitably reflect on the diligence of this great evangelist.

2. "There was a sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas concerning Mark, who was still anxious to devote himself to the work of the ministry. This contention caused Paul and Barnabas to separate, the latter following out his convictions, and taking Mark with him in his work. Paul could not, at that time, excuse in any degree the weakness of Mark in deserting them [in Pamphylia — see Acts 13:13] and the work upon which they had entered, for the ease and quiet of home; and he urged that one with so little stamina was unfit for the gospel ministry, which required patience, self-denial, bravery, and faith, with a willingness to sacrifice even life if need be. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to excuse Mark, who was his nephew, because of his inexperience. He felt anxious that he should not abandon the ministry, for he saw in him qualifications for a useful laborer in the cause of Christ. Paul was afterward reconciled to Mark, and received him as a fellow laborer." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 47, 48.

3. "If Silas had not returned to Jerusalem, but had remained in Antioch, he had doubtless recommended himself to Paul by some special proof of fitness for dealing sympathetically with the relations of the Jewish Christians and the Gentile converts. This sympathy on the part of Silas would be the more marked and significant as he was himself almost certainly a Hebrew; otherwise we can not account for his high position in the Jerusalem church, although his Roman citizenship is implied in Acts 16:37." — "Expositor's Greek Testament," Knowling, column 2, page 331.

4. Timothy no doubt accepted the gospel under Paul's ministry on his first missionary journey, and probably was an eye-witness of his persecution at these places. In the interim between the first and second visits he had become favorably known in the regions about his home as a consistent adherent to the Christian faith. Paul "did not venture to accept Timothy, an untried youth, without diligent inquiry with regard to his life and character. After fully satisfying himself on these points, Paul received Timothy as his fellow laborer and son in the gospel." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 73.

5. "Paul, with his usual good judgment, caused Timothy to be circumcised; not that God required it, but in order to remove from the minds of the Jews an obstacle to Timothy's ministration. Paul was to labor from place to place, in the synagogues, and there to preach Christ. If his companion should be known as an uncircumcised heathen, the work of both would be greatly hindered by the prejudice and bigotry of the people. The apostle everywhere met a storm of persecution. He desired to bring the Jews to Christianity, and sought as far as was consistent with the faith to remove every pretext for opposition." — Id., page 73.

6. In verses 4, 6, 7, Luke, the writer of the Acts, speaks of Paul and those who were with him in the third person, "They went through the cities," "when they had gone," "After they were come." This would indicate that Luke was not one of the company. In verse 11 he changes to the first person, "We came with a straight course," etc., which would indicate he was one of the company, having evidently joined Paul and Silas at Troas.

7. "The luxurious extravagance of the age created a large demand for purple in the market of Rome, and Lydia found room for her profitable trade among the citizens of Philippi." — Farrar's "Life of St. Paul," page 276.

8. We have other examples of baptism following immediately after the acceptance of Christ. See the case of the jailer in the next lesson, and of the eunuch in chapter 8. Baptism is an inseparable part of the commission to the gospel ministry. It was evidently set forth plainly as an obligation upon their hearers by these early apostles. See Matt. 28:19, 20.
