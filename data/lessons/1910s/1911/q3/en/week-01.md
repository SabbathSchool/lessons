### Notes

1. "Lystra is about six hours S.S.W. from Iconium. The exact site of Lystra is on a hill in the center of the valley. The hill rises about 100 to 150 feet above the plain, and the sides are steep. Few traces of ancient buildings remain above the surface. Situated on this bold hill, Lystra could easily be made a very strong fortress, and must have been well suited for its purpose of keeping in check the tribes of the mountain districts that lie west and south of it." — Abbreviated from Ramsay's "Church in the Roman Empire," pages 47-50.

2. "The temple of the Lystrian Jupiter still stood before the gate, and the priest still offered the people's sacrifices to the imaginary protector of the city. Heathenism was invaded, but not yet destroyed. Some votaries had been withdrawn from that polytheistic religion which wrote and sculptured in stone its dim ideas of 'present deities,' crowding its thoroughfares with statues and altars, ascribing to the king of the gods the attributes of beneficent protection and the government of atmospheric changes, and vaguely recognizing Mercury as the dispenser of fruitful seasons and the patron of public happiness." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 176.

3. "Paul came to Lystra again after the interval of one or two years, and on that occasion we are told that he found a certain Christian there 'whose name was Timotheus, whose mother was a Jewess, while his father was a Greek,' and whose excellent character was highly esteemed by his fellow Christians of Lystra and Iconium. It is clearly stated that at the time of this second visit Timothy was already a Christian; and since we know from Paul's own expression, 'my own son in the faith,' that he was converted by Paul himself, we must suppose this change to have taken place at the time of the first visit." — Id., pages 171, 172.

4. "But both Paul and Barnabas returned again to visit Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the fields of labor where they had met such opposition and persecution. In all those places were many that believed the truth; and the apostles felt it their duty to strengthen and encourage their brethren who were exposed to reproach and bitter opposition. They were determined to securely bind off the work which they had done, that it might not ravel out. Churches were duly organized in the places before mentioned, elders appointed in each church, and the proper order and system established there." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 62, 63.
