# Thousand Tract Pages and One Hundred Printed Envelopes for $5

The most convenient, as well as the most economical way for a church to supply itself with tracts, is to secure the Five Dollar Tract Package. This package contains 10,000 pages of our very best tracts, together with 100 printed envelopes for systematic distribution. Each kind of tract is wrapped by itself, and the whole is strongly wrapped and tied in a package weighing 13½ pounds. These tracts have been selected with a twofold object in mind:

First—To supply a church with the very best tracts we have on the leading points of our faith; namely, Second Coming of Christ, Immortality Question, the Sabbath, Health and Temperance, together with three beautiful Gospel stories; and one each on Faith, Conversion, and Bible Study References.

Second—A series that has proved to be well adapted to systematic distribution by the envelope method, for which purpose 100 envelopes are included in the package.

The list is as follows:

## Systematic Work

The envelope system makes possible a systematic house-to-house work, which may be taken up as follows:

1. Each volunteer for the work should say about how many homes he or she can conveniently visit regularly. Ordinarily ten, six, or even four, are enough for the average person to attempt at once.

2. Take seven envelopes, number them 1, 2, 3, etc., and then with tracts suggested in list given below fill these. As many sets as needed may be made up in the same way, and delivered to workers.

3. Worker begins with No. 1, visiting homes in his territory, and leaving one with each.

4. The following week No. 2 is used, and No. 1 taken up, unless reader wishes to keep it.

5. If possible have a regular time for going; keep the work up, giving out the next number each week, and taking up the one preceding.

## Suggestive Division for Envelope Use

The 700 tracts contained in this package are sufficient to make 175 envelope packages—25 each of the seven—and still have 25 copies of "Thoughts for the Candid," "The Seven, or One Seventh?" "Which Day and Why?" "The Demons' Council," and "How Esther Read Her Bible," for general distribution. The suggestive division for envelope use is as follows:

### NO. 1

The special price of $5.00 for this $7.00 package does not include transportation charges, which are about $1.15, if sent by express. It is hoped that it may be sent by freight with other supplies, in which case the cost will be but a few cents.

The success already attending the use of this package leads our best missionary workers to believe it will prove to be as convenient, economical, and popular to our churches as the Dollar Package has been found to be for the family or individual.

# A NEED SUPPLIED

It was a little more than two years ago that the publishers of the SIGNS OF THE TIMES, acting upon insistent demands for a religious magazine that would prove more salable than the weekly journal, began publishing the SIGNS OF THE TIMES MONTHLY. Its magazine form, variety of subjects treated, well-illustrated pages, and beautiful covers in colors, caused it to meet with instant favor.

A sister residing in Portland, Oregon, has sold over 38,000 copies during these past two years. She has earned a net weekly wage of about $25. Others are regularly selling from 50 to 1000 and even more each month.

These faithful workers have a purpose in doing this work which is higher than the mere earning of money. They are endeavoring to win souls to the truth. This is the secret of their staying with the SIGNS MONTHLY, even if they sell but a few copies a month.

Here is what one of our agents has to say about the SIGNS MONTHLY:

"Enclosed please find $16.00 for which send me 400 of the October SIGNS MONTHLY. I have sold half of my last order of 400 already. They sell well. I will be sorry when my strength fails so I can't sell the SIGNS. I love the work and am so glad I can earn my living in service for the Master."

Other agents are wanted who can devote even a small portion of their time to this work. Write to-day direct to us or to your tract society for further information. Orders should be sent through the tract society.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES, Mountain View, Cal.
