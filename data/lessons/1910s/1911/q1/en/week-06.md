## Notes

1. "Great numbers had collected at Jerusalem to observe the sacred feast. The exciting scenes of the crucifixion and resurrection had called out a much larger number than usual. When the truth taught by the apostles was brought suddenly and with convincing power before them, thousands were converted in a day. These early believers were most of them immediately cut off from family and friends by the zealous bigotry of the Jews. Many of the converts were thrown out of business, and exiled from their homes because they followed the convictions of their consciences, and espoused the cause of Christ. It was necessary to provide this large number, congregated at Jerusalem, with homes and sustenance. Those having money and possessions cheerfully sacrificed them to the existing emergency. Their means were laid at the feet of the apostles, who made distribution to every man according as he had need; and there were none among them who lacked."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 282, 283.

2. "This was the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon the believers. It made them of one heart and soul. They had one common interest—the success of the mission entrusted to them. Their love for their brethren, and the cause which they had espoused, was far greater than their love for money and possessions. They acted out their faith, and by their works testified that they accounted the souls of men of far greater value than any earthly heritage."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 283.

3. "Ananias and Sapphira coveted popularity and high position which they saw those enjoying who had thus given all they possessed to their brethren and were spending their lives in the services of the gospel. But this popularity came high; it would cost them their possessions. And such a price they were unwilling to pay. So they tried to get it by means of hypocrisy. They professed to give all that they had received for the piece of property which they had sold. Hypocrites are a hindrance to any good movement. The better the movement, the greater the danger from such people, and the more injurious are their presence and influence. A few individuals of such character, who in this way had got leading positions in the young church, could have ruined it. The danger was great, the remedy severe."—Thatcher, "History of the Apostolic Church," page 80.

4. Though the punishment was severe, it was just, and spared the infant church from greater sorrow. It caused them to have greater awe in God's presence and greater reverence for the Holy Spirit. It led to careful living, to searching of heart lest they might be deceived. It also caused those who were not Christians to realize the terrible nature of sin, and to understand the heart-searching presence of God. Those who were not sincere were kept out of the church, and many who were longing for power for right living were added to the church.

5. "As the people of God approach the perils of the last days, Satan holds earnest consultation with his angels as to the most successful plan of overthrowing their faith... He directs his angels to lay their snares especially for those who are looking for the second advent of Christ, and endeavoring to keep all the commandments of God. Says the great deceiver:... 'Go, make the possessors of lands and money drunk with the cares of this life. Present the world before them in its most attractive light, that they may lay up their treasure here, and fix their affections upon earthly things. We must do our utmost to prevent those who labor in God's cause from obtaining means to use against us. Keep the money in our own ranks. The more means they obtain, the more they will injure our kingdom by taking from us our subjects. Make them care more for money than for the upbuilding of Christ's kingdom and the spread of the truths we hate, and we need not fear their influence; for we know that every selfish, covetous person will fall under our power, and will finally be separated from God's people.'"—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 4, pages 337, 339.
