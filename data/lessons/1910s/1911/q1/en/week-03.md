## Notes

1. If the righteous receive their reward at death, Peter's argument proves nothing. But David's body had been left in hades, or the grave; so the text must refer to Christ, who was resurrected.

2. In this reference we have allusion to two ancient customs, one that of kings' placing on their right those for whom the highest honors were intended (1 Kings 2:19), and the other of conquerors' treading on the neck of their vanquished foes as a symbol of complete subjection. See Phil. 2:5-11.

3. This was doubtless a fulfillment of Jesus' promise to His disciples in John 14:2. "A work similar to that which the Lord did through His delegated messengers after the day of Pentecost He is waiting to do to-day."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 7, page 33.

4. As disciples, or learners, they studied the doctrines or teachings perseveringly. This, with the ordinances and prayer-meetings, bound them together in Christian fellowship, and built them up. All this was a willing and joyful service.

5. There were doubtless great numbers from all over the world, away from their usual means of support, who wanted to become more thoroughly instructed in the Christian life before returning home. Having consecrated all to God, those who had property voluntarily turned it into money to meet this need. There seems to have been no holding of property in common, or public ownership. Private ownership of property did not cease among Christians. See Acts 12:12. Every able-bodied man was charged with the duty of supporting his own household; and to fail of this through neglect, was a denial of the faith. 1 Tim. 5:8. But in cases of need and distress, every believer is a steward of God; and when the cause of Christ suffers need, no believer can say that aught that he has is his own.
