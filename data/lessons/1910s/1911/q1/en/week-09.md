## Notes

1. The student should read the whole discourse carefully, and endeavor to grasp its purpose and thought. It is a remarkable defense. Had he offered an abstract defense against the charges, he would doubtless have been stopped much sooner than he was. Jewish history was a favorite theme among the Hebrew people. To secure their attention, give time for their rage to subside, and to show that their charges of his opposition to Moses and the Jewish religion were not true, he gave a review of their history, showing how it led to Christ and a spiritual religion not confined to any one place, such as the temple.

2. Mesopotamia, "between the rivers," is doubtless used in a general sense, including all the Tigro-Euphrates country. "Ur of the Chaldees" has been identified with the mound Mugheir in lower Babylonia, but has not been fully excavated.

3. In Jewish history the time of the sojournings of their fathers among strangers and amidst afflictions was counted from the wanderings of Abraham to the exodus from Egypt. Abraham was called out from his kindred and country to Canaan, into which the Lord promised to lead his descendants; but on account of the famine in the land he went down at once into Egypt. Gen. 12:1-10. According to the chronology in the margin of the Common Version, this was B.C. 1921. Just four hundred thirty years later, according to the same chronology, Israel went out of Egypt. Ex. 12:40, 41, marginal date. Sometimes in Scripture this period is referred to by even figures as four hundred years.

4. This was God's everlasting covenant. "The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden, when after the fall, there was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. To all men this covenant offered pardon, and the assisting grace of God for future obedience through faith in Christ. It also promised them eternal life on condition of fidelity to God's law. Thus the patriarchs received the hope of salvation. This same covenant was renewed to Abraham in the promise, 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' This promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it, and he trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. It was this faith that was accounted unto him for righteousness."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 370.

5. In Gen. 46:26 it is stated that the number of Jacob's house who went down with him into Egypt was sixty-six, "besides Jacob's sons' wives." Stephen is counting not the direct descendants only but also the "kindred," and so includes the wives, making seventy-five as the total family.

6. Though Jacob and the twelve patriarchs died in Egypt, they believed God's promise of deliverance, and desired their bones to be buried in the land of Canaan. Jacob was buried with Abraham at Machpelah (Gen. 50:13). The words in verse 16, of Stephen's address, refer to the twelve patriarchs—"our fathers"—mentioned in the closing words of the preceding verse. We have only the account of the carrying of Joseph's bones to Sychem for burial (Joshua 24:32), but evidently at some time the other eleven patriarchs were likewise buried there by their posterity.

7. "They were not yet prepared for freedom. In slaying the Egyptian, Moses had fallen into the same error so often committed by his fathers, of taking into their own hands the work that God had promised to do. It was not God's will to deliver His people by warfare, as Moses thought, but by His own mighty power, that the glory might be ascribed to Him alone."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 246, 247.

8. "Moses was not prepared for his great work. He had yet to learn the same lesson of faith that Abraham and Jacob had been taught—not to rely upon human strength or wisdom, but upon the power of God for the fulfillment of His promises. And there were other lessons that, amid the solitude of the mountains, Moses was to receive."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 247.
