## ASSIGNMENT

The book of Acts may be divided into three periods: (1) Organization (chapters 1 to 7). (2) Transition (chapters 8 to 12). (3) Expansion (chapters 13 to 28). We have covered the first of these periods. Endeavor now to fix thoroughly in mind the facts and lessons of the chapters studied. Review the chapters until you can think through the story and readily give the main topics.
