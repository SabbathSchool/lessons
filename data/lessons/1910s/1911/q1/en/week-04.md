## Notes

1. It is not certain which of the several gates belonging to the temple is meant, but probably the magnificent doors of Corinthian brass described by Josephus, which led from the Gentile court to the court of the women. It is said that the folds of this gate were seventy-five feet high and sixty feet broad, and were covered with plates of gold and silver.

"This unfortunate man had long desired to go to Jesus and be healed; but he was almost helpless, and was removed far from the scene of the great Physician's labors. Finally his earnest pleadings induced some kind persons to bear him to the gate of the temple. But upon arriving there he discovered that the Healer upon whom his hopes were centered, had been put to a cruel death."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 275.

2. Every one who has received Christ in the heart has something of infinitely more value to give than silver or gold. And it is a law of the kingdom that these precious blessings must be continually given away to be retained.

3. "I. Faith performs the miracle (Peter and John). II. Faith experiences the miracle (the lame man). III. Faith comprehends the miracle (the believing hearers)."—Lange.

4. Daniel the prophet had written of the solemn scene, just before the coming of Christ, when the Ancient of Days should sit in judgment and the books of heaven be opened. Dan. 7:9, 10. Before this tribunal every case was to come; and Peter exhorted his hearers to make sure work for that great day. And now that, in the closing days of our own generation, the judgment hour is fast passing, when the record of sin will be blotted out, or the names be blotted out, how urgent the same call to repentance! Note some of the promises for this time of judgment, and of refreshing by the latter rain. See Rev. 2:7, 10, 11. The time of the latter rain is also the shaking time. While those who seek God shall increase in strength, the careless and contentious and unconsecrated will be shaken out of the ranks of God's people.
