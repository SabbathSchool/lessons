## Notes

1. These are qualifications for persons chosen to any church office, and they exalt the office. The business of the church as well as the ministry of the Word should be done in the most diligent and religious spirit. Phillips Brooks well said, Never fear to do the smallest act with the highest motive.

2. This was a synagogue for foreign Jews—Libertines, Jews and their descendants who had been Roman captives and who had been freed by their captors. "Tacitus speaks of 10,000 Libertine Jews."—Lewin. It is said that there were 460 synagogues in Jerusalem.

3. The same accusation had been brought against Christ. Matt. 26:61. Probably Stephen had taught the prophecies of Daniel and Christ concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, and that the sacrificial services had lost their meaning. But doubtless, like Paul, he could say, "Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended anything at all." Acts 25:8.

4. These intolerant religionists were very jealous for the influence of Moses, yet they could not recognize Christ, of whom Moses wrote, or understand the glory that shone on Stephen's face, such as that which had illuminated the face of Moses.
