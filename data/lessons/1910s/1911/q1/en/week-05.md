## Notes

1. "Being grieved;" Greek, "troubled all through," or "thoroughly worked up." Probably most of the worshipers had left the inner precincts of the temple, and were drinking in the words of life preached by the apostles. "This preaching the resurrection of Christ, and that through His death and resurrection He would finally bring up all the dead from their graves, deeply stirred the Sadducees. They felt that their favorite doctrine was in danger, and their reputation at stake. Some of the officials of the temple, and the captain of the temple, were Sadducees."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 278.

2. This was the supreme council of the Jewish nation, the Sanhedrin. It was composed of seventy-one members, and sat in a semicircle of which the high priest was the central figure. Both Sadducees and Pharisees were members at this time. Annas was acting high priest, though he had been deposed, and Caiaphas his son-in-law appointed by the Roman authority. See Luke 3:2; John 11:49; 18:13. Of John and Alexander we know nothing. They were probably prominent relatives of the high priest.

3. "In that very room, and before those very men, Peter had shamefully denied his Lord. All this came distinctly before the mind of the disciple, as he now appeared for his own trial. He had now an opportunity of redeeming his former wicked cowardice.

The company present remembered the part Peter had acted at the trial of his Master, and they flattered themselves that he could be intimidated by the threat of imprisonment and death. But the Peter who denied Christ in the hour of His greatest need, was the impulsive, self-confident disciple, differing widely from the Peter who was before the Sanhedrin for examination that day. He had been converted; he was distrustful of self, and no longer a proud boaster. He was filled with the Holy Spirit, and through its power he had become firm as a rock, courageous, yet modest, in magnifying Christ. He was ready to remove the stain of his apostasy by honoring the name he had once disowned."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 279.

4. Christ's promise of Matt. 10:19, 20, was fulfilled that day.

5. In accordance with later direction in his epistle (1 Peter 2:17) Peter here showed due regard to his renowned audience, but being filled with the Holy Ghost he does not fail to declare the whole counsel of God, and he and John are not slow to tell the Sanhedrin what attitude the disciples must sustain toward the demand not to preach Christ.
