# Sabbath-School Lessons on the BOOK OF ACTS

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The book of Acts is the most remarkable church history ever written; one which is full of lessons for the remnant people. "The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close."—"Great Controversy," page 611.

That the author was Luke is acknowledged by nearly all Bible students. He was probably a Greek. He was a physician—a profession of honor among the Greeks. Jerome speaks of him as "a physician of Antioch." He was doubtless a well-educated man and of a lovable and modest disposition. He is called "the beloved physician." He does not mention his own name in the book.

It is commonly thought that the book was written about A.D. 63, as the narrative breaks off suddenly at the end of Paul's first imprisonment at Rome. It is generally believed that the book was written at Rome, as the author mentions his arrival at Rome (Acts 28:16), and does not mention his departure. This is not conclusive however.

Well might the book be called the "Acts of the Holy Spirit." The Holy Spirit is mentioned seventy-one times. It is a continuous record of a great spiritual revival accomplished by the superhuman power of the Holy Spirit through ordinary men.

The missionary lessons of this book ought to stir the church today to such activity as it has not yet experienced. Everything is ready for the quick finishing of the gospel work. What is needed is apostolic supplications, the forsaking of sins, and Pentecostal power.
