# Lesson 12 — Support of the Gospel Work
JUNE 17, 1911

NOTE — Along with the study of the beginnings of missionary operations in the early church, it is appropriate that we review, for one lesson, the Lord's plan for the support of His work on earth. The early church was familiar with the system of tithes and offerings for the maintenance of the temple and its services. "Do ye not know," said Paul, "that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel." 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.

## Notes

1. Abraham paid tithe to Melchisedec after God had made him the father of them that believe. The lesson is obvious that those who by faith follow in the footsteps of Abraham, and by faith accept the promised Seed as the Son of God, in whom is life, acknowledge also the Lord's ownership of the tithe.

2. "'Of all that Thou shalt give me,' said Jacob, 'I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.' Shall we who enjoy the full light and privileges of the gospel, be content to give less to God than was given by those who lived in the former, less favored dispensation? Nay, as the blessings we enjoy are greater, are not our obligations correspondingly increased? But how small the estimate; how vain the endeavor to measure with mathematical rules, time, money, and love, against a love so immeasurable and a gift of such inconceivable worth. Tithes for Christ! O, meager pittance, shameful recompense for that which cost so much! From the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an unreserved consecration. All that we have, all that we are, should be devoted to God." — "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 188.

3. The priesthood after the order of Melchisedec, king of Salem, is that royal order after which Christ is now our great High Priest. Under this order tithe-paying is a part of the service of the worshiper. So, too, it was under the Levitical order. Thus, from the call of Abraham, which was the preaching of the gospel to him as father of the faithful, on to the end we find tithe-paying a part of the Scripture record. By the Scriptures studied, it is shown that all along the obligation, or rather the privilege, of returning a tenth to the Lord, is clearly made known. Besides this, free-will offerings were to be given. It is made very evident that the acceptance by any person of the privileges of the gospel, lays him under certain obligations, among which is that of paying a tithe of all his increase into the treasury for the support of God's work in the earth. This portion is reserved by God; it "is the Lord's," ever consecrated "holy unto the Lord."

4. It should ever be borne in mind that compliance with any of these sacred duties, such as tithe-paying, or baptism, or even Sabbath-keeping, in itself can not commend us to God. These things are the fruits of living faith. And the same faith will bring forth the fruits of mercy, judgment, and love for God and man. The rebuke of Christ addressed to the Pharisees applies to any to-day who, like them, pass over the weightier principles of the law, even though they may be very scrupulous in outward form. "These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."

5. "The magnitude of our work calls for willing liberality on the part of the people of God. In Africa, in China, in India, there are thousands, yes, millions, who have not heard the message of the truth for this time. They must be warned. The islands of the sea are waiting for a knowledge of God... The Lord has made us His stewards. He has placed His means in our hands for faithful distribution. He asks us to render to Him His own. He has reserved the tithe as His sacred portion, to be used in sending the gospel to all parts of the world. My brethren and sisters, confess and forsake your selfishness, and bring to the Lord your gifts and offerings. Bring Him also the tithe that you have withheld. Come confessing your neglect. Prove the Lord, as He has invited you to do." — "Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 51, 52.
