## Notes

1. Perga, the capital of Pamphylia, was on the river Cestrus, then navigable, about seven miles from the Mediterranean. It was northwest of Paphos. Celebrated for its worship of Diana.

Antioch of Pisidia, a city on the central table-land of Asia Minor. The journey from Perga to Antioch was a perilous one. Some commentators think reference is made to it in 2 Cor. 11:26. It will be remembered that the Antioch from which the journey was begun was in Syria.

"Paul and his company now continued their journey, going into Perga, in Pamphylia. Their way was toilsome, they encountered hardships and privations, and were beset by dangers on every side, which intimidated Mark, who was unused to hardships. As still greater difficulties were apprehended, he became disheartened, and refused to go farther, just at the time when his services were most needed. He accordingly returned to Jerusalem, and to the peace and comfort of his home. Mark did not apostatize from the faith of Christianity; but, like many young ministers, he shrank from hardships, and preferred the comfort and safety of home to the travels, labors, and dangers of the missionary field. This desertion caused Paul to judge him unfavorably and severely for a long time. He distrusted his steadiness of character, and his devotion to the cause of Christ." — "Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 352.

2. Synagogues were established in every foreign city where Jews were numerous. "After prayers, which were of a prescribed form, though extempore prayers were often added, a lesson from the law was followed by another from the prophets, the reader being usually designated by the ruler of the synagogue. Then came an address or sermon. Here there was large liberty, though the ruler (or rulers) of the synagogue remained in control. Any well-known rabbi, and even strangers who had some repute as teachers, might be invited to speak (verse 15). This liberty was constantly made available by the Christian missionaries." — Riddle, in "Sunday School Times."

"The synagogue was always a plain, rectangular building erected on the highest spot in the neighborhood, or having a tall pole on the roof to make it conspicuous. Unlike the scribes who desired to have the chief seat' (Mark 12:38, 39), Paul and Barnabas entered the synagogue and sat down with the congregation. The chief seats were around the ark or chest at one end of the building, containing the sacred rolls. Before the ark hung a veil and lamps. In front was a platform with its reading desk or pulpit. In the congregation the men were separated from the women. During the prayers Paul and Barnabas stood with the rest with their faces toward Jerusalem." — Tarbell.

3. "The Jews were never tired of hearing their own history. Whenever a speaker arose in Jewish society determined to carry a specific point, he came with all the background of Jewish history, and under the influence of recollections heroic and thrilling, he endeavored to carry the immediate point of the occasion. One might have expected that the Jews would have become weary of hearing their history time after time, but historians record it to their credit that they were always ready to hear the living story again." — Joseph Parker.
