## Notes

1. "Peter preached Jesus to that company of attentive hearers; His life, ministry, miracles, betrayal, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and His work in heaven, as man's Representative and Advocate, to plead in the sinner's behalf. As the apostle spoke, his heart glowed with the Spirit of God's truth which he was presenting to the people. His hearers were charmed by the doctrine they heard, for their hearts had been prepared to receive the truth. The apostle was interrupted by the descent of the Holy Ghost, as was manifested on the day of Pentecost." — "Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 331, 332.

| 2. Anointed with power. Verse 38. | 2. It makes character the test. Verse 35. |
| 3. His death. Verse 39. | 3. It offers salvation through faith. Verse 43. |

3. Peter and Cornelius worked out in the Lord's way a difficult problem. By the same process we must solve the latter-day problems. They were men of prayer. They did their immediate duty without concern for what lay farther ahead. They did what the Lord asked them to do now, without inquiry as to what He would ask of them another day or another year. If we are not doing His will at this moment, we shall never be sure of knowing His will later.
