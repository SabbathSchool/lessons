## Notes

1. Gaza, earlier called Azzah, was the most southern city in Palestine, about fifty miles southwest of Jerusalem, on the shore route between Palestine and Egypt. It was a very ancient city. Throughout Bible times it was generally held by the Philistines. See Judges 16:21-30.

"The epithet 'desert' as applied to the region between Jerusalem and Gaza, did not necessarily mean that it was all sand and bare rock. Sections might be suitable for olive-trees and grain crops, but there were no large springs or brooks for irrigation and the nourishment of flocks and herds, and therefore there could be few or no villages in which the evangelist could preach. It seemed an unreasonable command, and one that involved a waste of time, but 'he arose and went.'"

2. The name "Ethiopia" (Hebrew, Kush, country of burnt faces) is doubtless here used to refer to a kingdom south of Egypt, including part of modern Nubia and the Egyptian Sudan. It was governed by queens, whose dynastic name was Candace. The inhabitants were dark-skinned, but were probably not Negroes. The eunuch was no doubt a native of the region.

3. A careful study of this lesson reveals the secret of successful missionary work. Notwithstanding the fact that the Lord sent Philip into a desert to wait by the roadside, he obeyed at once. If he had delayed one day, or even a few hours, he would have missed meeting the Ethiopian. When Philip saw the chariot, again the Spirit said, "Go." If Philip had delayed, the chariot would soon have passed; but he ran, and thus joined the chariot. Philip met the man where he was. He did not introduce a new subject, but was familiar enough with the Scriptures to preach the full gospel message, including baptism, from the verses the eunuch was reading.

4. Azotus, the ancient Ashdod, was about fifteen miles north of Gaza, and near the coast. It was the seat of the worship of Dagon. See 1 Sam. 5:1-9. Caesarea, on the coast, was about seventy miles northwest of Jerusalem, and about the same distance north of Azotus. Unlike Gaza and Azotus, it was then a modern city, built by Herod the Great about twenty-two years before the birth of Christ.
