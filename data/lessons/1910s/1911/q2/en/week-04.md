## Notes

1. The "band" means a Roman cohort. The Roman army was divided into legions, each legion into ten cohorts, each cohort into three maniples, and each maniple into two centuries. A centurion was the officer in command of a century, which consisted of a hundred men. Originally the members were recruited in Italy.

2. The visions given to Cornelius and Peter, like those given to Saul and Ananias, found recorded in Acts 9, show very clearly how God plans and directs events so as to instruct and save those who love truth and righteousness, and sincerely desire a knowledge of God.

3. The Jew considered the touch of the Greek as defiling, "his food was an abomination to the devout Israelite, and his religion blasphemy." Peter "knew that the Gentile was to be saved. The Old Testament declared it on every page. The Lord Jesus confirmed it. But how should it be accomplished? It was accomplished. The prejudices and the convictions of the ages gave way... And he who knows what human nature is must admit that no earthly power could have solved the problem in a single generation. Only God could." — Abbreviated from J. M. Stigler, "The Acts."

4. It was hard for Peter, with all his Jewish prejudices, to understand the vision. God was preparing his mind for the messengers who were on the road from Caesarea. If Peter had fully accepted this call from God to labor among the Gentiles, his life-work might have equaled Paul's. The vision was not given to sanction the eating of flesh of unclean animals, but to teach Peter that he "should not call any man common or unclean," — that the Gentiles were as precious in God's sight as the Jews. Acts 10:28.
