## Notes

1. Phenicia (Phenice) lay between Galilee and Syria. Cyprus was the nearest large island in the Mediterranean. Cyrene was in Africa. Antioch, the capital of Syria, was situated on the river Orontes, about sixteen miles from the sea. Tarsus, Saul's native city, was the chief city of Cilicia.

2. It is quite probable that the work among the Gentiles at Caesarea and the Grecians at Antioch reminded Barnabas of what the Lord had declared concerning Saul, "He is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles." When Barnabas saw that God was working for the Gentiles, he thought the time had come when Saul should enter upon the work God had called him to do; so he went in search of him.

3. "It was here that the disciples were first called Christians. This name was given them because Christ was the main theme of their preaching, teaching, and conversation. They were continually recounting the incidents of His life, during the time in which His disciples were blessed with His personal company. They dwelt untiringly upon His teachings, His miracles of healing the sick, casting out devils, and raising the dead to life. With quivering lips and tearful eyes they spoke of His agony in the garden, His betrayal, trial, and execution, the forbearance and humility with which He endured the contumely and torture imposed upon Him by His enemies, and the Godlike pity with which He prayed for those who persecuted Him. His resurrection and ascension, and His work in heaven as a Mediator for fallen man, were joyful topics with them. The heathen might well call them Christians, since they preached of Christ, and addressed their prayers to God through Him." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," pages 40, 41.

4. A list of the prominent characteristics of the church at Antioch is impressive:
1. A church born of persecution. Verse 19.
2. A church of different nationalities. Verses 19, 20.
3. A church of able leadership. Verses 22-26.
4. A church of growing influence. Verses 21, 26.
5. A church of generous givers. Verses 27-30.
