## Notes

1. Coos was a small island in the Grecian Archipelago about forty miles south of Miletus. It was celebrated for its manufactories of silk, ointments, wines, etc. Rhodes was also an island in the Grecian Archipelago. On the island was a city of the same name, which was principally distinguished for its brazen Colossus one hundred feet high. The Colossus stood astride the mouth of the harbor, and was so high that vessels could pass beneath. It stood for fifty-six years, and had been destroyed by an earthquake 244 B.C., long before Paul's visit. It was reckoned as one of the seven wonders of the world.

2. "The Holy Spirit had revealed to these brethren something of the dangers which awaited Paul at Jerusalem, and they endeavored to dissuade him from his purpose. But the same Spirit which had warned him of afflictions, bonds, and imprisonment, still urged him forward, a willing captive." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 203.

   Tyre was about three hundred and fifty miles from Patara. It was one of the greatest and most famous cities of the ancient world. Hiram, king of Tyre, aided Solomon in building the temple, B.C. 1000. 1 Kings 9.

3. "Philip the evangelist was bound to Paul by ties of the deepest sympathy. A man of clear discernment and sterling integrity, Philip had been the first to break away from the bondage of Jewish prejudice, and thus had helped prepare the way for the apostle's work. It was Philip who preached the gospel to the Samaritans; it was Philip who had the courage to baptize the Ethiopian eunuch." — Id., page 204.

4. It was common for the prophets to perform actions emblematic of the events they predicted. The design was to make the prediction more forcible and impressive by representing it to the eye. Thus Jeremiah was directed to hide his girdle by the Euphrates, to denote the approaching captivity of the Jews. Jer. 13:4. He was directed to make bands and yokes, and to put them around his neck, as a sign to Edom and Moab. Jer. 27:2, 3.

5. "The apostle was deeply moved by the entreaties of his beloved brethren. To human judgment he had sufficient reason to relinquish his plan as unwise. But he felt that he was moving in obedience to the will of God, and he could not be deterred by the voice of friends, or even the warning of the prophet. He would not swerve from the path of duty to the right hand nor to the left. He must follow Christ, if need be, to prison and to death. His tears fell not for himself, but in sympathy with his brethren, upon whom his determination had brought so great sorrow." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 205.

6. "This was Paul's last visit to Jerusalem. The school of Gamaliel, the synagogue of the Libertines, the house where the high priest had given him his commission to Damascus, the spot where the reddened grass had drunk the blood of Stephen, must have stirred painful memories. But never had he trod the street of the holy city with so deep a sadness as now that he entered it, avoiding notice as much as possible, in the little caravan of Caesarean pilgrims and Gentile converts. He was going to a city where friends were few, and where well-nigh every one of the myriads among whom he moved was an actual or potential enemy." — F. W. Farrar, quoted in "Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909, page 328.
