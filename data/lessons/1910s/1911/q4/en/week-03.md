## Notes

1. "Had he [Paul] spoken in Greek, the majority of those who heard him would have understood his words. But the sound of the holy tongue in that holy place fell like a calm on the troubled waters. The silence became universal and breathless." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 555.

2. "But when his mission to the Gentiles was announced — though the words quoted were the words of Jehovah spoken in the temple itself, even as the Lord had once spoken to Samuel — one outburst of frantic indignation rose from the temple area and silenced the speaker on the stairs. Their national pride bore down every argument which could influence their reason or their reverence. They could not bear the thought of uncircumcised heathens being made equal to the sons of Abraham. They cried out that such a wretch ought not to pollute the earth with his presence — that it was a shame to have preserved his life; and in their rage and impatience they tossed off their outer garments (as on that other occasion when the garments were laid at the feet of Saul himself), and threw up dust into the air with frantic violence." — Id., pages 556, 557.
