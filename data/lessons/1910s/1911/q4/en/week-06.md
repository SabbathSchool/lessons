## Notes

1. Nothing is known of Tertullus except the mention here. "The description of Tertullus here as an orator indicates that he was a paid advocate." — Abbott.

2. "Tertullus here descended to bare-faced falsehood. The character of Felix was base and contemptible. It was said that he 'practised all kinds of lust and cruelty with the power of a king and the temper of a slave.'... His acts of cruelty and oppression caused him to be universally hated." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 235.

3. "This reference to Lysias may have been a device for turning away the Jews, an excuse for the temporary dismissal of the case, and need not imply that Felix was in doubt regarding Paul's innocence and was waiting for further light. There is no record that Lysias ever came down to Caesarea, or that Felix made any effort to have him come. It is not probable that the Jews waited long in Caesarea on such an uncertainty. They returned to Jerusalem with the small satisfaction that if Paul was still alive, he at least was not preaching and destroying the influence of Moses. They seem to have attempted nothing further for two years." — "Student's Life of Paul," Gilbert, page 193.
