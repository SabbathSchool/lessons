## Notes

1. "When Peter had been made a prisoner and condemned to death, the brethren had offered earnest prayer to God day and night for his deliverance. But no such interest was manifested in behalf of him who was looked upon as an apostate from Moses, a teacher of dangerous doctrines. It was not to the elders whose counsel had brought him into this dangerous position, but to the watchful sympathy of a relative, that Paul owed his escape from a violent death." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 226.

   "This mention of Paul's relative is one of those touches which make the whole world kin. From this we may infer that some, at least, of Paul's family were reconciled to him, and perhaps that they occupied an influential position, within reach of information about the secret policy of the high priest." — "Acts of the Apostles," Rackham, page 438.

2. "Lysias gladly improved this opportunity to get Paul off his hands. He was the object of so great animosity, and his presence created so wide-spread an excitement, that a riot might occur among the people at any time, with consequences dangerous to the commandant himself. The Jews as a people were in a state of excitement and irritation, and tumults were of frequent occurrence. A short time previous, a Roman knight of far higher rank than Lysias himself, had been violently taken and dragged by the maddened Jews around the walls of Jerusalem, and finally beheaded, because he received a bribe from the Samaritans. Upon the suspicion of similar crimes, other high officials had been imprisoned and disgraced. Should Paul be murdered, the chief captain might be charged with having been bribed to connive at his death. There was now sufficient reason to send him away secretly, and thus get rid of an embarrassing responsibility." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 227.

3. "The escort and their prisoner marched all night to Antipatris, a distance of about thirty-five miles. At Antipatris they halted; and, the immediate danger being passed, the foot soldiers returned thence to Jerusalem, leaving the horsemen to conduct Paul the remaining twenty-seven miles to Caesarea, where they probably arrived on the following day. So within a fortnight Paul was back at Caesarea, and the apprehensions of the disciples there were fulfilled." — "Acts of the Apostles," Rackham, page 440.

4. "After ascertaining the necessary information, Felix determined to hear the case when the accusers should arrive. Meanwhile Paul was to be confined in free custody in Herod's palace, now the residence of the Roman governor, and therefore called by the Romans the pretorium." — Id.
