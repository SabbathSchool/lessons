## Notes

1. "This commotion threw Lysias into new perplexity. He had not been able to understand the apostle's Hebrew speech, and when he saw its results he concluded that his prisoner must be guilty of some enormous crime. He ordered him therefore to be taken immediately from the stairs into the barracks, and to be examined by torture in order to elicit a confession of his guilt." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 557.

2. "Tarsus had received great benefits both from Julius Caesar and Augustus, but the father of Paul was not on that account a Roman citizen. This privilege had been granted to him or had descended to him as an individual right; he might have purchased it for a 'large sum' of money; but it is more probable that it came to him as the reward of services rendered during the civil wars to some influential Roman... The family of Paul were in the same position at Tarsus as those who were Jews of Asia Minor and yet citizens of Rome at Ephesus; and thus it came to pass that while many of his contemporaries were willing to expend a 'large sum' in the purchase of 'this freedom,' the apostle himself was 'free-born.'" — Id., page 52.

3. "The apostle's bearing was calm and firm. The peace of Christ, ruling in his heart, was expressed upon his countenance. But his look of conscious innocence offended his accusers, and when he fearlessly addressed them, 'Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day,' their hatred was kindled afresh, and the high priest ordered him to be smitten upon the mouth." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 221, 222.

4. "These words were not an outburst of passion. Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Paul uttered a prophetic denunciation similar to that which Christ had uttered in rebuking the hypocrisy of the Jews." — Id., page 222.

5. "This exclamation produced an instantaneous effect on the assembly. It was the watchword which marshaled the opposing forces in antagonism to each other. The Pharisees felt a momentary hope that they might use their ancient partisan as a new weapon against their rivals." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 559.
