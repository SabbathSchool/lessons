## Notes

1. "It was the fourteenth night that they had been tossed up and down on the black, heaving billows, when, amid the sound of the storm, the sailors distinguished the roar of breakers, and reported that they were near some land. They 'sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.' They were now threatened by a new danger, of having their ship driven upon some rock-bound coast. They immediately cast out four anchors, which was the only thing that could be done. All through the remaining hours of that night they waited, knowing that any moment might be their last. The leak was constantly increasing, and the ship might sink at any time, even if the anchors held." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 267.

2. "A slight effort of imagination suffices to bring before us an impressive spectacle as we think of the dim light just showing the haggard faces of the two hundred and seventy-six persons clustered on the deck and holding on by the bulwarks of the sinking vessel. In this hour of anxiety the apostle stands forward to give them courage. He reminds them that they had 'eaten nothing' for fourteen days, and exhorts them now to partake of a hearty meal, pointing out to them that this was indeed essential to their safety, and encouraging them by the assurance that 'not a hair of their head' should perish. So speaking, he set the example of the cheerful use of God's gifts and grateful acknowledgment of the Giver by taking bread, 'giving thanks to God before all,' and beginning to eat. Thus encouraged by his calm and religious example, they felt their spirits revive, and 'they also partook of food,' and made themselves ready for the labor which awaited them." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 610.

3. "Whether one is ready for the hour of opportunity or emergency depends on the whole previous life, and the real testing time is not the critical moment itself, but all the apparently unimportant moments which precede it. The hour reveals, but does not make, the man. David was able to save the armies of Israel because he had learned to use his sling in his shepherd life. It was General Charles James Napier who said, 'The smith who has to look for his hammer when the iron is red strikes when it is too late; the hammer should be uplifted to fall like a thunderbolt while the white heat is in the metal.'

   "The greatness of Paul as a man and as a leader is shown on this voyage to Rome. His brave endurance of hardship, his presence of mind in time of danger, his tireless activity, his unselfishness, his practical wisdom, his sympathy for others, his good cheer, and above all, his perfect trust in God, are brought out by the exciting scenes of peril. But all these qualities have been shown again and again in the record of his life given in the Acts, and in his own self-revelation in his letters. He was the foremost man on that ship, because he had lived the noblest life and had attained to the greatest character." — "Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909.

4. "Julius the centurion knew that Paul had been instrumental in saving the lives of all on board, and he felt that it would be the basest ingratitude to allow him to be put to death; and more, he felt convinced that the Lord was with Paul, and he feared to do him harm. He therefore gave orders to spare the lives of the prisoners, and directed that all who could swim should cast themselves into the sea and get to land. The rest seized hold of planks and other fragments of the wreck, and were carried landward by the waves." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 270.

5. Melita is the island that is now called Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, one hundred fifty miles southwest of the most southern point of Italy. "Malta is seventeen miles long by nine miles wide at its greatest breadth. Its area is ninety-five square miles. One of the greatest sieges of history took place here in 1565. Since 1800 it has belonged to the English." — "Peloubet's Notes," 1909.

6. "The whole scene is brought very vividly before us in the sacred narrative. One incident has become a picture in Paul's life with which every Christian child is familiar. The apostle had gathered with his own hands a heap of sticks and placed them on the fire, when a viper came 'out of the heat' and fastened on his hand. The poor superstitious people when they saw this said to one another, 'This man must be a murderer: he has escaped from the sea, but still vengeance suffers him not to live.' But Paul threw off the animal into the fire and suffered no harm. Then they watched him, expecting that his body would become swollen or that he would suddenly fall down dead. At length, after they had watched for a long time in vain and saw nothing happen to him, their feelings changed as violently as those of the Lystrians had done in an opposite direction, and they said that he was a god. We are not told of the results to which this occurrence led, but we can not doubt that while Paul repudiated, as formerly at Lystra, all the homage which idolatry would pay him, he would make use of the influence acquired by this miracle for making the Saviour known to his uncivilized benefactors." — "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, pages 613, 614.
