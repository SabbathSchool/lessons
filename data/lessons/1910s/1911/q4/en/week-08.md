### General Note
In this lesson we begin a study of the twenty-sixth chapter of Acts. This chapter "is one of the twenty-six chapters of the Bible which Ruskin's mother had him commit to memory, whereby, as Ruskin says, she established his soul in righteousness. It is well worth being learned by heart, for it contains the finest address in the Acts, the best account we have of the great apostle's relation to his mission, and in its dignity, sincerity, skill, and persuasiveness it proves the power of the gospel to 'turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.' It is called Paul's apologia pro vita sua, his defense of his life, but the apostle is not pleading in fear for his life; he shows, indeed, that he has done nothing worthy of death, but he does so in defending Christianity as being, not contrary to earlier divine revelation, but a fulfilment of that revelation, a culmination of all past promises." — "Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909.

## Notes

1. "In all the pomp and splendor of royalty, Agrippa and Bernice went to the audience-room, attended by a train of followers in the costly apparel of Eastern display. Proudly the haughty ruler with his beautiful sister swept through the assembly, and seated himself by the procurator's side. At his command, Paul, still manacled as a prisoner, was led in, and the king gazed with cold curiosity upon him, now bowed and pale from sickness, long imprisonment, and continual anxiety.

   "What a contrast was there presented! Agrippa and Bernice were destitute of the traits of character which God esteems. They were transgressors of His law, corrupt in heart and in life. God and angels abhorred their course of sin. But because they possessed, in a limited degree, power and position, they were the favorites of the world. That aged prisoner, standing chained to his soldier guard, presented nothing imposing or attractive in his dress or appearance, that the world should pay him homage. Yet this man, apparently without friends or wealth or position, had an escort that worldlings could not see. Angels of heaven were his attendants. Had the glory of one of those shining messengers flashed forth, the pomp and pride of royalty would have paled before it; king and courtiers would have been stricken to the earth, as were the Roman guards at the sepulcher of Christ." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 253, 254.

2. "Herod Agrippa II, ruler of some principalities in northern Palestine, with the title of king; son of Herod Agrippa I, who slew James the son of Zebedee; great-nephew of Herod Antipas, who beheaded John the Baptist; great-grandson of Herod the Great, who massacred the innocents in his attempts to kill the infant Jesus. He was made supervisor of the temple at Jerusalem, and had the privilege of appointing its high priest. When the last Jewish war broke out with the Romans, he received into his territory and protected those who fled before the siege of Titus began." — "Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909, page 272.

   "Stretching forth his manacled right hand, he [Paul] said: 'I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews. Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.'

   "Did the mind of Agrippa at these words revert to the past history of his family, and their fruitless efforts against Him whom Paul was preaching? Did he think of his great-grandfather Herod, and the massacre of the innocent children of Bethlehem? of his great-uncle Antipas, and the murder of John the Baptist? of his own father, Agrippa I, and the martyrdom of the apostle James? Did he see in the disasters which speedily befell these kings an evidence of the displeasure of God in consequence of their crimes against His servants? Did the pomp and display of that day remind Agrippa of the time when his own father, a monarch more powerful than he, stood in that same city, attired in glittering robes, while the people shouted that he was a god? Had he forgotten how, even before the admiring shouts had died away, vengeance, swift and terrible, had befallen the vainglorious king? Something of all this flitted across Agrippa's memory; but his vanity was flattered by the brilliant scene before him, and pride and self-importance banished all nobler thoughts." — "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 255, 256.
