## Notes

1. "We can have the salvation of God in our families, but we must believe for it, live for it, and have a continual, abiding faith and trust in God. We must subdue a hasty temper, and control our words; and in this we shall gain great victories. Unless we control our words and temper, we are slaves to Satan. We are in subjection to him. He leads us captive. All jangling, and unpleasant, impatient, fretful words are an offering presented to his satanic majesty. And it is a costly offering, more costly than any sacrifice we can make for God; for it destroys the peace and happiness of whole families, destroys health, and is eventually the cause of forfeiting an eternal life of happiness."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 1, page 310.

2. "It is remarkable that our divine Master, in telling us of the coming Judgment, makes the final destiny of all men to depend upon whether in this world they have exercised or have not exercised the grace of kindness. For we are not done with life as we live it. We shall meet it all again, not only the great things we do, but the little things. Even our lightest words take their place among the fixed things of life, and will be recalled in the Judgment. Jesus said, 'Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Judgment.' He does not say every wrong or evil word, but every useless, purposeless, or frivolous word. The meaning is that the smallest things in life, both the evil and the good, will be taken account of in the Judgment."—"The Beauty of Kindness," pages 9, 10.

3. "Nothing else we can do is more worth while than kindness. There is nothing that the world needs more, and nothing else that leaves more real and far-reaching good in human lives. Some day we shall learn that the little deeds of love wrought unconsciously, as we pass on our way, are greater in their helpfulness, and will shine more brightly at the last, than the deeds of renown which we think of as alone making a life great."

"Some of us, if we were to try to sum up the total of our usefulness, would name a few large things we have done,— the giving of money to some benevolent object, the starting of some good work which has grown into strength, the writing of a book which has made us widely known, the winning of honor in some service to our community or to our country. But in every worthy life that which has really left the greatest measure of good has been its ministry of kindness. No record of it has been kept. People have not talked about it. It has never been mentioned in the newspapers. But where we have gone, day after day, if we have simply been kind to every one, we have left blessings in the world which in their sum far exceed the good wrought, the help imparted, and the cheer given, by the few large, conspicuous things we have done, of which we think and speak with pride." —Id., pages 3, 9.

"Turgenef in one of his little parables tells of meeting on the way a beggar, who held out his greasy hand for alms. Turgenef searched all his pockets, but had no money, no food, nothing whatever, to give the man. He said to him, 'I am sorry, brother, that I have nothing for thee.' The beggar's face brightened, and he said: 'That is enough. Thank you.' To be called 'brother' was better than any alms would have been."— Id., page 88.

4. "Those who profess to believe the third angel's message often wound the cause of God by lightness, joking, and trifling. I was shown that this evil was all through our ranks. There should be a humbling before the Lord; the Israel of God should rend the heart, and not the garment. Childlike simplicity is rarely seen; the approbation of man is more thought of than the displeasure of God."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 1, page 133.
