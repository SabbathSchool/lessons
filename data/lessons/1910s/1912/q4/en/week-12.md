## Notes

1. A traveler to the Euphrates relates that when he came to the Valley of Salt he broke off a piece that had been exposed to the rain, sun, and air, and found that, though it had all the sparkle and other qualities of salt, it had lost its savor. This is true of many professed Christians. If we desire to salt the world, we must begin with ourselves. We must be good if we wish to do good. Salt has preserving qualities; but before its work can be effective in helping the world, it must be brought into close contact with the world.

2. It is said that on the coast of Scotland there is a dangerous rock too small for a lighthouse to be built upon it, but a glass prism set on it with iron stanchions catches the beams from a lighthouse on shore and throws them along the ship's course. In like manner we are to reflect to the world the light of Jesus. It is God's light, and not our own, that we are to give.

3. "The very soul of our religion is missionary, progressive, world embracing; it would cease to exist if it ceased to be missionary, if it disregarded the parting words of its Founder, 'Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,' etc. The spirit of truth is the life-spring of all religion; and where it exists, it must manifest itself, it must plead, it must persuade, it must convince and convert. There may be times when silence is gold, and speech silver; but there are times also when silence is death, and speech is life,—the very life of Pentecost. Look at the religions in which the missionary spirit has been at work, and compare them with those in which any attempt to convince others by argument, to save souls, to bear witness to the truth, is treated with pity or scorn. The former are alive; the latter are dying or dead."—Max Muller.

4. This experience in the life of Hezekiah contains a very practical lesson. In answer to prayer Hezekiah had been healed, and fifteen years added to his life. Besides, the Lord had wrought a great miracle; a wonder had been seen in the heavens. Curious to understand concerning this, an embassy was despatched from Babylon to Jerusalem to make inquiry. A great opportunity was thus given Hezekiah to make known the true God to these representatives of a kingdom. He could bring before them his personal experience, and how, in answer to his earnest request, God's power had been made manifest in his restoration to health. Before him was an opportunity to make a personal appeal to the members of this embassy in behalf of the true God, and lead them to worship the One who had power over the bodies of men, as well as over the planetary system. Instead of this, however, he showed them, doubtless with more or less pride, the increase of his riches, his kingly treasures, his storehouses, his flocks, herds in abundance, and impressed them with the might of his kingdom. No doubt the profusion of wealth and princely establishments created a desire to possess this wealth, which resulted later in a conquest of Jerusalem being projected, and Daniel and others being taken to Babylon, where in captivity they made known the true God.

Let us not make a like mistake, when meeting persons in our homes and elsewhere, of spending all our time talking about our own business and secular plans, and the commonplace things of the world, and neglecting to bring before them the goodness and power of God, and the special work now being done in the world. Have we done this? If so, let the experience of Hezekiah serve as a warning.

5. From this example of Jesus, we see how a single soul, though the poorest and most obscure, is worthy of our efforts. We would scarcely have expected a revival of godliness to come to Sychar through such an unlikely instrument. But this woman first had a face-to-face talk with Jesus. This changed her entire life, and she then began personal work for those near at hand.

"In the words spoken to the woman at the well, good seed had been sown, and how quickly the harvest was received! The Samaritans came and heard Jesus, and believed on Him. Crowding about Him at the well, they plied Him with questions, and eagerly received His explanations of many things that had been obscure to them. As they listened, their perplexity began to clear away. They were like a people in great darkness tracing up a sudden ray of light till they had found the day. But they were not satisfied with this short conference. They were anxious to hear more, and to have their friends also listen to this wonderful Teacher. They invited Him to their city, and begged Him to remain with them. For two days He tarried in Samaria, and many more believed on Him."—"Desire of Ages," page 192.
