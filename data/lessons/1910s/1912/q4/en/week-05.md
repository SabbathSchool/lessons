## Notes

1. "Workers were raised up who ably defended the faith once delivered to the saints. History bears record to the fortitude and heroism of these men. Like the apostles, many of them fell at their post, but the building of the temple went steadily forward. The workmen were slain, but the work advanced. The Waldenses, John Wyclif, Huss and Jerome, Martin Luther and Zwingle, Cranmer, Latimer, and Knox, the Huguenots, John and Charles Wesley, and a host of others brought to the foundation material that will endure throughout eternity. And in later years those who have so nobly endeavored to promote the circulation of God's word, and those who by their service in heathen lands have prepared the way for the proclamation of the last great message,— these also have helped to rear the structure."—"Acts of the Apostles," page 598.

2. "Trial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to purify God's children from the dross of earthliness. It is because God is leading His children, that trying experiences come to them. Trials and obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better than they themselves can know them. He sees that some have qualifications which, if rightly directed, could be used in the advancement of His work. In His providence He brings these souls into different positions and varied circumstances, that they may discover the defects that are concealed from their own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to overcome these defects, and to fit themselves for service. Often He permits the fires of affliction to burn, that they may be purified."— Id., page 524.

3. "Not in freedom from trial, but in the midst of it, is Christian character developed. Exposure to rebuffs and opposition leads the follower of Christ to greater watchfulness, and more earnest prayer to the mighty Helper. Severe trial endured by the grace of God develops patience, vigilance, fortitude, and a deep and abiding trust in God. It is the triumph of the Christian faith that enables its follower to suffer and be strong; to submit, and thus to conquer; to be killed all the day long, and yet to live; to bear the cross, and thus to win the crown of glory."— Id., pages 467, 468.

4. "Stars shine brightest in the darkest night; torches are the better for beating; grapes come not to the proof till they come to the press; spices smell sweetest when pounded; young trees root the faster for shaking; vines are the better for bleeding; gold looks the brighter for scouring; glowworms glisten best in the dark; juniper smells sweetest in the fire; pomander becomes most fragrant for chasing; the palm-tree proves the better for pressing; camomile, the more you tread it, the more you spread it. Such is the condition of all God's children; they are the most triumphant when most tempted, most glorious when most afflicted, most in the favor of God when least in man's; as their conflicts, so their conquests; as their tribulations, so their triumphs." —Spencer.

5. "It is the broken rock that sends forth streams of living water through the wilderness. It is the broken ground that opens its bosom for the reception of the incorruptible seed which springs up, and which brings forth fruit abundantly. It is the broken cloud that discharges itself in showers that usher in the spring, and cheer the thirsty ground. It is the broken alabaster wherewith the poor penitent anoints the feet of the Saviour, and which fills the whole house with the odor of the precious spikenard. It is the broken body, which the nails of the cross, and the spear of a mortal enemy, have pierced, that furnishes the blood that cleanses the soul from all sin. It is the broken veil that opens into the holiest of all, and gives to the believing soul bright glimpses into the glory that is yet to be revealed. It is the broken grave that announces the reality of the resurrection, and proclaims to the unbelieving disciple that the Saviour is risen indeed. It is the broken corn that is separated from the chaff, and laid up in the garner of the husbandman, or changed into the bread of life. And it is the broken berries which the millstones of the olive press have crushed, that give forth the precious oil which filled the dark tabernacle with the radiance of a clear and tranquilizing light."— Dr. J. Hamilton.
