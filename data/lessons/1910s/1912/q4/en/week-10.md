## Notes

1. These three cities are mentioned, doubtless, for the reason that it was here that the Lord did much of His labor, and performed many of His wonderful miracles. They had abundant opportunity to see the clear evidence of His Messiahship. But they deliberately rejected Him, and closed their eyes to the light, because of unbelief. Having had greater light than Sodom, their condemnation was correspondingly greater. See John 15:22.

2. "While God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never remove all excuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to hang their doubts upon, will find them. And those who refuse to accept and obey God's word until every objection has been removed, and there is no longer an opportunity for doubt, will never come to the light.

"Distrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart, which is at enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and it will flourish only as it is cherished. No man can become strong in faith without a determined effort. Unbelief strengthens as it is encouraged; and if men, instead of dwelling upon the evidences which God has given to sustain their faith, permit themselves to question and cavil, they will find their doubts constantly becoming more confirmed."—"Great Controversy," revised edition, page 527.

3. Consecrated wealth can be a great blessing and one of the instruments for advancing the kingdom of God on earth. The sin is in hoarding it, and using it for selfish purposes, instead of helping needy souls about us.

4. Those who practice sin are the slaves of sin, in bondage to Satan. This is bondage in the truest sense, a load heavy to be borne. Jesus came to deliver the world from the power of evil habits. We are bidden to cast off the binding yoke of Satan, and take the free, easy yoke of Jesus. With the invitation comes the power to do the thing.
