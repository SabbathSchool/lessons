## Notes

1. It may seem at first thought strange to tell a burden bearer that the way to find rest is to take upon him another burden, a yoke, though it be easy and light. But it is a different yoke from that of sin; it is Christ's yoke.

"The water-wheel is but a yoke put upon the neck of the river, that it may be compelled to spin and weave for us; the sail is simply a yoke attached to the winds to make them plow the great deeps with the furrows of a nation's commerce; the telegraph wire is only a yoke for harnessing the electricity, that it may run our errands and flash our thought to the ends of the world. Nothing in earth or air or sea is of use to us till it has been restrained and made obedient to our will. And so, instead of contradicting the general order, Christ by these words lays down one of the most universal of principles. Freedom for service comes through repression of self. We must be narrowed into liberty, and constrained into true power."— A. J. Gordon.

2. Two sparrows for one farthing, or five for two farthings. One is added, or thrown in, where the purchase was two farthings. The thought is that the one given away as of no comparative value, is not forgotten by the Lord. Then the statement, which if possible goes still farther in expressing the intimate watch-care of our heavenly Father, "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered." With the psalmist we can exclaim, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I can not attain unto it." Ps. 139:6.

"Sometimes it is hard to believe that the infinite God, who holds the seas in His hand, and controls the stars in their courses, should care for each individual soul. We are so small, and God's universe is so great! We are but insects on a world which is but a grain of sand to many of the stars. . . . If He provides for birds and flowers, for the insects of an hour, for the bees, 'the singing masons building roofs of gold,' how much more will He care for the souls and bodies of His children, made in His own likeness!"—Peloubet's Notes, 1910, page 74.
