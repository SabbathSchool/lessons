## Notes

1. "All that man received of God's bounty still belongs to God. Whatever God has bestowed in the valuable and beautiful things of earth, is placed in the hands of men to test them,— to sound the depths of their love for Him and their appreciation of His favors. Whether it be the treasures of wealth or of intellect, they are to be laid, a willing offering, at the feet of Jesus; the giver saying, meanwhile, with David, 'All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 753.

2. Mind and body are to be yielded to God. All is to be laid on the altar, not a dead but a living sacrifice. This is the Lord petitioning us to consecrate ourselves wholly to Him. The unyielding life is the citadel of self. This fortress God will not force us to yield, yet nothing else will suffice for deliverance. When once we give up all, making our consecration complete and unconditional, the Lord will flood the soul with the fulness of His blessing.

3. The gifts here mentioned came from poverty. We are told that "Macedonia had lost the benefits of its mines, which the Roman government had apportioned to itself, and was suffering from the weight of taxation." But the joy of a new-found salvation was so great that they forgot their extreme poverty and gave liberally. But above all, they "gave their own selves to the Lord." Herein lies the foundation of all liberality.

4. "I said one day to a great business man, 'How long would you keep a man in your employ if you knew he was half for you and half for your competitor?' He said, 'I should keep him until I found it out.' Stepping over to his private desk, he took out a piece of paper and handed it to me, and I read an iron-clad agreement, which stated that whenever a man became part of this great business concern, he practically said to the representative of the company, 'All my influence is yours, all my strength, is yours, all the power I have is yours.' And the merchant said to me: 'When a man signs that contract, we give him the right to use our name. We would not give him this privilege if we could not control him.'"—"Power," by J. Wilbur Chapman, pages 17, 18.

5. "The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially the gifts and blessing imparted by the Holy Spirit. . . . But not until after the ascension was the gift received in its fulness. Not until through faith and prayer the disciples had surrendered themselves fully for His working, was the outpouring of the Spirit received. Then in a special sense the goods of heaven were committed to the followers of Christ. 'When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.' 'Unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,' the Spirit dividing to every man severally as He will.' The gifts are already ours in Christ, but their actual possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit of God. . . .

"The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents represented in the parable. It includes all gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired, natural or spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ's service. In becoming His disciples, we surrender ourselves to Him with all that we are and have. These gifts He returns to us purified and ennobled, to be used for His glory in blessing our fellow men.

"To every man God has given 'according to his several ability.' The talents are not apportioned capriciously. He who has ability to use five talents receives five. He who can improve but two, receives two. He who can wisely use only one, receives one. None need lament that they have not received larger gifts; for He who has apportioned to every man, is equally honored by the improvement of each trust, whether it be great or small. The one to whom five talents have been committed is to render the improvement of five; he who has but one, the improvement of one. God expects returns 'according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.'"—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 327, 328.

6. "It was the one with the smallest gift who left his talent unimproved. In this is given a warning to all who feel that the smallness of their endowments excuses them from service for Christ. If they could do some great thing, how gladly would they undertake it! but because they can serve only in little things, they think themselves justified in doing nothing. In this they err. The Lord in His distribution of gifts is testing character. The man who neglected to improve his talent, proved himself an unfaithful servant. Had he received five talents, he would have buried them as he buried the one. His misuse of the one talent showed that he despised the gifts of Heaven."—Id., page 355.
