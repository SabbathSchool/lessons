### Notes

1. All will be without excuse if the day of God comes and finds them unprepared. Note the scope covered by the signs:
   (a) In the sun,
   (b) In the moon,
   (c) In the stars,
   (d) Among the nations,
   (e) In the sea,
   (f) In the hearts of men.

2. No doubt the primary meaning of this text is that in the last days people will search the prophecies, and as a result knowledge of the Scriptures will increase. But it doubtless has a broader meaning, as knowledge in all lines follows where the word of God is studied.

"To appreciate them [the wonders of this age], let us briefly contrast the conditions of to-day with those of a hundred years ago. This is no easy task, for the comparison not only involves the experiences of two generations, but it is like the juxtaposition of a star with the noonday sun, whose superior brilliancy obliterates the lesser light... we make the backward run of one hundred years, we have passed by many mile-stones of progress. Let us see if we can count some of them as they disappear behind us. We quickly lose the telephone, phonograph, and graphophone. We no longer see the cable-cars or electric railways. The electric lights have gone out. The telegraph disappears. The sewing-machine, reaper, and thrasher have passed away, and so also have all india-rubber goods. We no longer see any photographs, photoengravings, photolithographs, or snap-shot cameras. The wonderful octuple web perfecting printing-press, printing, pasting, cutting, folding, and counting newspapers at the rate of 96,000 per hour, or 1,600 per minute, shrinks at the beginning of the century into an insignificant prototype. We lose all planing and wood-working machinery, and with it the endless variety of sashes, doors, blinds, and furniture in unlimited variety. There are no gas-engines, no passenger-elevators, no asphalt pavement, no steam fire-engine, no triple-expansion steam-engine, no Giffard injector, no celluloid articles, no barbed wire fences, no time-locks for safes, no self-binding harvesters, no oil- or gas-wells, no ice machines nor cold storage. We lose air-engines, stem-winding watches, cash-registers, and cash-carriers, the great suspension bridges and tunnels, the Suez Canal, iron-frame buildings, monitors and heavy ironclads, revolvers, torpedoes, magazine guns, and Gatling guns, linotype machines, all practical typewriters, all Pasteurizing, knowledge of microbes or disease germs, and sanitary plumbing, water-gas, soda-water fountains, air-brakes, coal-tar dyes and medicines, nitroglycerin, dynamite and guncotton, dynamo-electric machines, aluminum ware, electric locomotives, Bessemer steel with its wonderful developments, ocean cables, enameled ironware, Welsbach gas-burners, electric storage-batteries, the cigarette machine, hydraulic dredges, the roller-mills, middlings purifiers and patent-process flour, tin-can machines, car couplings, compressed-air drills, sleeping-cars, the dynamite gun, the McKay shoe machine, the circular knitting-machine, the Jacquard loom, wood pulp for paper, fire alarms, the use of anesthetics in surgery, oleomargarin, street sweepers, Artesian wells, friction matches, steam hammers, electroplating, nail machines, false teeth, artificial limbs and eyes, the spectroscope, the kinetoscope or moving pictures, acetylene gas, X-ray apparatus, horseless carriages, and — enough! the reader exclaims, and indeed it is not pleasant to contemplate the loss." - From introduction to "Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century."

3. One of the surest evidences that the flood was coming was seen in the message sent of God through His servant Noah announcing this tremendous calamity. So in the last days, just before the Lord is to send His Son from heaven to reap the harvest of the earth, the surest, most unimpeachable witness that the coming of the Son of man is at the door, will be a definite message announcing the coming of Christ, based on the fulfilment of prophecy. Just such a message is now proclaimed in the world. A beginning has been made in almost all nations. Beyond a doubt the end is near.

4. The prophet Isaiah tells us what the people will be saying in the last days. While great preparations for war are seen on every hand, the people will be planning disarmament and arbitration, and teaching that war will be a thing of the past. This false cry is to be so marked that it will constitute a sign of the end. 1 Thess. 5:1-3.

5. A few years ago Bishop Newman said: "We are now passing through the most unsettled condition of the whole world since the crucifixion of Christ... And whatever cause it is that touches the first match to the fuse, no human power can foretell in what countries that fuse may lead to an international explosion."

Canon Scott Holland, an English clergyman, somewhat recently said: "The outlook in Europe never presented so wholly an unchristian spectacle since the days of Constantine. Even in medieval days, peace, and not war, was regarded as the normal condition of men. Now nations were watching one another like wild beasts in a jungle, and Christian Europe had armed itself in defiance of everything which Christ came to teach. Blood and iron rule; huge camps and seas, crowded with horrible ships of war, met the eye at every turn. Men scrambled for land, and the question was who should be first in the race. Are we to be swept away in the pagan scramble?"
