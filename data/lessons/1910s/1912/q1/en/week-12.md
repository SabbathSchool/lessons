### Notes

1. The Lord blessed Abraham that he might be a blessing. For a like reason He blessed the Sabbath day, that it might be a blessing to man. The blessing of God placed on the Sabbath is just as real as the blessing which He gives to man. But in order for us to enjoy this blessing, it is necessary that we observe, as He has directed, the day He blessed.

2. We are to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Throughout the week we are so to plan our secular affairs that, when the Sabbath comes to us, we will be ready to receive it, and not desecrate its sanctity because of our forgetfulness. In this sense the fourth commandment, like the other nine, is connected with all the transactions of life during the entire seven days of the week.

3. The divine Sabbath law commands that man's work shall be done in the "six working days" (Eze. 46:1). The first hour of the Sabbath is as holy as any other hour; and when the Sabbath day begins, our work should end and the Lord's work should be done. Many are so burdened with the "cares of this life" that they frequently violate the sanctity of the Sabbath at its beginning and at its close in order to do their own work. Those who do this grieve the Spirit, and fail of receiving the full blessing of Sabbath-keeping.

There is no more fitting way to begin the Sabbath than, as its sacred hour draws near, to assemble the family, and, after singing and reading God's blessed word, engage in a season of prayer, invoking pardon for sin, and asking for a Sabbath blessing. Then as its closing moments draw nigh, offer a prayer of thanksgiving, and ask for strength for the coming week.

4. "When the Sabbath commences we should place a guard upon ourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by appropriating to our own use that time which is strictly the Lord's. We should not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to do, any manner of our own work for a livelihood, or anything which could have been done on the six working days. Friday is the day of preparation. Time can then be devoted to making the necessary preparation for the Sabbath, and to thinking and conversing about it. Nothing which will in the sight of Heaven be regarded as a violation of the holy Sabbath should be left unsaid or undone, to be said or done upon the Sabbath. God requires not only that we refrain from physical labor upon the Sabbath, but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes. The fourth commandment is virtually transgressed by conversing upon worldly things, or by engaging in light and trifling conversation. Talking upon anything or everything which may come into the mind, is speaking our own words. Every deviation from right brings us into bondage and condemnation." — "Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, pages 702, 703.

5. We are not to do our own ways, or our own pleasure, or speak our own words on the Sabbath. To think and plan regarding secular business on the Sabbath, or permit our mind to dwell on things pertaining to worldly pleasure, is a violation of the Sabbath. The fourth commandment, like the other precepts, covers the thoughts and intents of the heart; and when the Sabbath begins there should be a cessation, not simply of secular labor, but of secular thoughts as well.

6. By tradition the Sabbath had been made a yoke of bondage. The Author of the Sabbath swept away their traditions, and taught the people true Sabbath-keeping. The following from Edersheim gives a few of the many traditions with which the Pharisees had surrounded the Sabbath till its true object was lost:

"Next, certain regulations are laid down to guide the Jew when dressing on the Sabbath morning, so as to prevent his breaking its rest. Hence he must be careful not to put on any dress which might become burdensome, nor to wear any ornament which he might put off and carry in his hand, for this would be a 'burden.' A woman must not wear such head-gear as would require unloosing before taking a bath, nor go out with such ornaments as could be taken off in the street, such as a frontlet, unless it is attached to the cap, nor with a gold crown, nor with a necklace or nose-ring, nor with rings, nor have a pin in her dress. The reason for this prohibition of ornaments was, that in their vanity women might take them off to show them to their companions, and then, forgetful of the day, carry them, which would be a 'burden.' Women are also forbidden to look in the glass on the Sabbath, because they might discover a white hair and attempt to pull it out, which would be a grievous sin; but men ought not to use looking-glasses even on week days, because this was undignified. A woman may walk about her own court, but not in the street, with false hair."

"A plaster might be worn, provided its object was to prevent the wound getting worse, not to heal it, for that would have been a work. Ornaments which could not easily be taken off might be worn in one's courtyard. Similarly, a person might go about with wadding in his ear, but not with false teeth nor with a gold plug in the tooth. If the wadding fell out of the ear, it could not be replaced."

"If a woman were to roll wheat to take away the husks, she would be guilty of sifting with a sieve. If she were rubbing the ends of the stalks, she would be guilty of threshing. If she were cleaning what adheres to the side of a stalk, she would be guilty of sifting. If she were bruising the stalk, she would be guilty of grinding. If she were throwing it up in her hands, she would be guilty of winnowing. Distinctions like the following are made: A radish may be dipped into salt, but not left in it too long, since this would be to make pickle. A new dress might be put on, irrespective of the danger that in so doing it might be torn. Mud on the dress might be crushed in the hand and shaken off, but the dress might not be rubbed (for fear of affecting the material). If a person took a bath, opinions are divided, whether the whole body should be dried at once, or limb after limb. If water had fallen on the dress, some allowed the dress to be shaken but not wrung; others, to be wrung but not shaken." — Edersheim: "The Life and Times of Jesus," pages 781-783.
