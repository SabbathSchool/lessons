## Notes

1. There is a distinction to be made between eternal life and immortality. He who receives Christ by faith thereby lays hold upon "that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us," and so Jesus said, "He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life" (John 6:47); but that which is thus acquired by faith is retained only by faith. After immortality has been put on at the second coming of Christ, the eternity of being is fully assured. This was the purpose in view in the gift of Christ to take upon Himself humanity.

2. "Wherefore comfort one another with these words." That our loved ones are not troubled by the harrowing scenes of this life; that they are unconscious of what is transpiring about us, like one asleep; that to them, if saved, the next moment will be the greeting of their Saviour, never more to be separated from Him,— to believe thus, as the Scriptures so plainly teach, is not a comfortless, cheerless hope.
