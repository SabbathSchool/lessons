## Notes

1. "Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they can not change the heart; they can not purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—"Steps to Christ," chapter "The Sinner's Need of Christ."

2. "None are so vile, none have fallen so low, as to be beyond the working of this power. In all who will submit themselves to the Holy Spirit a new principle of life is to be implanted; the lost image of God is to be restored in humanity.

"But man can not transform himself by the exercise of his will. He possesses no power by which this change can be effected. The leaven — something wholly from without — must be put into the meal before the desired change can be wrought in it. So the grace of God must be received by the sinner before he can be fitted for the kingdom of glory. All the culture and education which the world can give, will fail of making a degraded child of sin a child of heaven. The renewing energy must come from God. The change can be made only by the Holy Spirit. All who would be saved, high or low, rich or poor, must submit to the working of this power."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 96, 97.

3. "They agreed in spirit and motive, while they differed in the form of excuse. They had accepted the invitation when remote, when it did not call upon them to take any action or give up any pleasure, but refused it when a decision must be made; just as men now want to go to heaven, and enter the pearly gates, and be saints and martyrs even; yet when the test time comes they are unwilling to accept the conditions, to do the deeds, to take up the cross, which are the necessary conditions."—Peloubet's Notes.

4. "As the sinner, drawn by the power of Christ, approaches the uplifted cross, and prostrates himself before it, there is a new creation. A new heart is given him. He becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus. Holiness finds that it has nothing more to require. God Himself is 'the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.' And 'whom He justified, them He also glorified.' Great as is the shame and degradation through sin, even greater will be the honor and exaltation through redeeming love. To human beings striving for conformity to the divine image there is imparted an outlay of heaven's treasure, an excellency of power, that will place them higher than even the angels who have never fallen."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 163.
