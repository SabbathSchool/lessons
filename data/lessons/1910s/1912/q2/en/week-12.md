## Notes

1. The love of money has its root in covetousness. Covetousness underlies all evil. It was Lucifer's coveting the place occupied by God that led him into sin. He coveted the worship, the honor, the power belonging to the Creator. Those who will be rich, those who bend every power of their being to acquire the possession of money, fall into hurtful lusts which drown men in perdition. This is an age of the world when this one thing has well-nigh become the overmastering ambition. Colossal fortunes are amassed only to become a curse to the possessor, to drag the soul down to perdition. From all this God seeks to deliver His children.

2. It is plain that before one can take for himself God's holy time, the seventh day, he must covet it. It is equally clear that this same commandment is also broken, as well as the eighth, before one can place with his own stuff God's part, the tenth, made holy by His reservation for a sacred use.

Says the deceiver:
"Go, make the possessors of lands and money drunk with the cares of this life. Present the world before them in its most attractive light, that they may lay up their treasure here, and fix their affections on earthly things. We must do our utmost to prevent those who labor in God's cause from obtaining means to use against us. Keep the money in our own ranks. The more means they obtain, the more they will injure our kingdom by taking from us our subjects. Make them care more for money than for the building up of Christ's kingdom and the spread of the truths we hate, and we need not fear their influence; for we know that every selfish, covetous person will fall under our power, and will be separated finally from God's people."—Mrs. E. G. White, in 1911 Week of Prayer Readings.

3. "It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made. Divine benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was impossible for God to give more... Why is our gratitude so limited? It is only as a ripple on the surface, compared with the great tide of love that flows to us from the Father."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 59, 60.

4. "If our churches will take their stand upon the Lord's word, and be faithful in paying their tithe into His treasury, more laborers will be encouraged to take up ministerial work. More men would give themselves to the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury. There should be an abundant supply in the Lord's treasury, and there would be if selfish hearts and hands had not withheld the tithes, or made use of them to support other lines of work."—Id., page 249.

5. "There are many who urge that they can not do more for God's cause than they now do; but they do not give according to their ability. The Lord sometimes opens the eyes blinded by selfishness by simply reducing their income to the amount they are willing to give. Horses are found dead in the field or stable, houses or barns are destroyed by fire, or crops fail. In many cases God tests man with blessings, and if unfaithfulness is manifested in rendering to Him tithes and offerings, His blessing is withdrawn."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 4, page 484.

6. A vow or pledge to give the Lord certain things, made at times of spiritual refreshing when the Holy Spirit moves the heart to benevolence, God holds very sacred indeed. It can not ruthlessly be set aside, nor later counted as a light matter, without great peril to the soul.

"Jacob made his vow while refreshed by the dews of grace, and invigorated by the presence and assurance of God. After the divine glory had passed away, he had temptations, like men in our time; but he was faithful to his vow, and would not harbor thoughts as to the possibility of being released from the pledge which he had made. He might have reasoned much as men do now, that this revelation was only a dream, that he was unduly excited when he made his vow, and that therefore it need not be kept; but he did not.

"Long years intervened before Jacob dared to return to his own country; but when he did, he faithfully discharged his debt to his Master. He had become a wealthy man, and a very large amount of property passed from his possession to the treasury of the Lord.

"Many in our day fail where Jacob made a success. Those to whom God has given the greatest amount have the strongest inclination to retain what they have, because they must give a sum proportionate to their property. Jacob gave the tenth of all that he had, and then reckoned the use of the tenth, and gave the Lord the benefit of that which he had used for his own interest during the time he was in a heathen land, and could not pay his vow. This was a large amount, but he did not hesitate; that which he had vowed to God he did not regard as his, but as the Lord's."— Id., pages 466, 467.
