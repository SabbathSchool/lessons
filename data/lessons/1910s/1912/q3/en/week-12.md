## Notes

1. No one can of himself choose to be a prophet, teacher, worker of miracles, or any other office bestowed by the Holy Spirit. God, through the Spirit, selects the instrument. We may decline the holy calling, and fail to fill the place to which the Lord has called us; but the gifts of the Spirit, whether of prophecy or some other gift, are distributed as the Spirit Himself wills.

2. That there are false claims put forth and spurious gifts exercised in the world is quite true, but this should in no way discredit the genuine. Counterfeit money is in circulation, but this does not discount the genuine coin. It is against "false prophets," teachers who depart from the Word, that we are warned. Though a pretended seer make a prediction which comes to pass, yet if he teach that which leads away from the true God and substitutes idolatry, if his teaching lead from the unerring Word to the tradition of men, we may know that his claims to be a prophet or teacher sent from God are not true, and we are not to "harken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams."

3. "That the Testimonies were not given to take the place of the Bible, the following extract from a Testimony published in 1876 will show:

"'Brother R would confuse the mind by seeking to make it appear that the light God has given through the Testimonies is an addition to the word of God; but in this he presents the matter in a false light. God has seen fit in this manner to bring the minds of His people to His word, to give them a clearer understanding of it.' 'The word of God is sufficient to enlighten the most beclouded mind, and may be understood by those who have any desire to understand it. But notwithstanding all this, some who profess to make the word of God their study, are found living in direct opposition to its plainest teachings. Then, to leave men and women without excuse, God gives plain and pointed Testimonies, bringing them back to the Word that they have neglected to follow.'" — "Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, page 663.

"Let the Testimonies be judged by their fruits. What is the spirit of their teaching? What has been the result of their influence? 'All who desire to do so can acquaint themselves with the fruits of these visions. For seventeen years, God has seen fit to let them survive and strengthen against the opposition of Satan's forces, and the influence of human agencies that have aided Satan in his work.'

"'God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs, and strengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is not. God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My work... bears the stamp of God, or the stamp of the enemy. There is no half-way work in the matter. The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil.'" — Id., page 671.
