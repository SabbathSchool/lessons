## Notes

1. It is by means of the Holy Spirit which is freely given to those who believe, that these spiritual gifts are bestowed upon the followers of Christ. These gifts are given, not as the believer may choose, but as the Spirit wills. 1 Cor. 12:11.

In the scriptures cited there are many different and distinct gifts of the Holy Spirit. There are other gifts as well, such as "gifts of healing, helps, governments," etc. Many make a mistake in emphasizing one gift of the Spirit to the exclusion of other important and helpful gifts which have been placed in the church for the edification of the body. While one gift may be more helpful and important than the others, all are necessary.

2. So long as the Holy Spirit strives with men, the gifts of the Spirit will be seen to a greater or less degree. God placed these gifts in the church "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." And they will remain there during the militant period of the church.
