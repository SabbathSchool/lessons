## Notes

1. "We never need to distrust God. The just Judge repulses no one who comes to Him in contrition. He has more pleasure in His church, struggling with temptations here below, than in the imposing host of angels that surround His throne. Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial choir, God hears the cries of the weakest human being." — Mrs. E. G. White, in "Signs of the Times," September 15, 1898.

2. The story of the invasion of Sennacherib, his defiance of God, and the miraculous destruction of his army, contains one of the most wonderful deliverances of God's people in answer to prayer, recorded in the Bible. No effort is made in the lesson to cover every detail, the one object being to strengthen faith in God by getting before our minds how, in answer to the prayer of His servant, the Lord sent deliverance to His people. We, too, are engaged in a warfare. Foes within us and enemies without at times threaten the overthrow of the cause and work of God; but now, as in the days of Hezekiah, God will not leave His people, but in answer to their earnest petitions will send help.

3. "Having utterly overthrown Merodach-baladan, Sennacherib turned fiercely upon his rebellious provinces in the west. Sidon at once surrendered before his impetuous onset. All Syria was terrorized and submitted. The allies from Egypt, marching northward, were defeated. Ekron fell, and its chief men were impaled on stakes. Turning then against his chief enemy, Sennacherib captured in swift succession forty-six of the fortified cities of Judah. He was rapidly approaching Jerusalem. 'Signs of the Assyrian advance were given in the sky, and night after night the watchers on Mount Zion, seeing the glare in the west, must have speculated which of the cities of Judah was being burned. Clouds of smoke across the heavens, from prairie and forest fires, told how war, even if it passed, would leave a trail of famine; and men thought with breaking hearts of the villages and fields, heritage of the tribes of old, that were now bare to the foot and the fire of the foreigner. Then came touch of the enemy, the appearance of armed bands, vistas down Jerusalem's favorite valleys of chariots, squadrons of horsemen emerging upon the plateaus to north and west of the city, heavy siege-towers and swarms of men innumerable.'" — George Adam Smith, quoted in Peloubet's Notes, 1905, page 195.

4. "Terrified at Sennacherib's approach, Hezekiah had raised the enormous tribute of three hundred talents of silver (about $600,000, equal in purchasing value to six million dollars to-day). He stripped the temple of its gold, and sent it to the Assyrian monarch, whose headquarters were at Lachish, about thirty-four miles southwest of Jerusalem. The tribute was accepted, but the invaders pressed on." — Id.

5. We should not fail to note that when Israel was involved in a terrible crisis, Hezekiah sent to the prophet of God to inquire if he had any instruction for them. And the Lord had not forgotten His people; He sent them a message of hope.

6. What a splendid example is here presented before us by Hezekiah! He took the threatening letter of the king, and "spread it before the Lord." When in trouble and almost overwhelmed with difficulty we too can obtain help by bringing it to the Lord, and earnestly seeking Him for help.
