## Notes

1. Standing was an ordinary attitude; but the word used to describe the Pharisee's position "differs from that used to designate the publican's standing, and gives a very different impression. It means that he stationed himself, struck an attitude, ostentatiously."— Vincent. How different the poor publican, who, feeling himself unworthy to mingle with other worshipers or approach near the altar, "stood afar off" with bowed head and downcast eyes.

"One nearer to the altar trod,
The other to the altar's God."

2. It was not really a prayer in the sense of a petition or thanksgiving to God. It was communing "with himself," and boasting in the name of thanksgiving. "The nearer we come to Jesus, and the more clearly we discern the purity of His character, the more clearly we shall discern the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the less we shall feel like exalting ourselves. Those whom heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to parade their own goodness."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 160.

3. He who measures himself by others is living by a low standard. Yet how natural it is to do it. H. Clay Trumbull says: "Even of those who admit that they are not righteous, most feel sure that they are not the worst men in the world; and they are glad of it. Men who will lie, boast that they do not steal. Men who will lie and steal, are glad that they are not drunkards. Men who are liars, thieves, and drunkards, take comfort in the thought that they have never been licentious. Men who know that they have broken every commandment of the moral law, thank God that they are not hypocrites and make no pretense to decency. Some men sit in their pews at church and congratulate themselves on their superiority to their neighbors, while others find their chief satisfaction in reading in the morning papers of 'another good man gone wrong.' The echo of the Pharisee's prayer fills the air to-day; and it is a very rare thing to find a person anywhere who does not think he is better than most men, if not better than all."

4. "The religion of the Pharisee does not touch the soul. He is not seeking Godlikeness of character, a heart filled with love and mercy. He is satisfied with a religion that has to do only with the outward life. His righteousness is his own,— the fruit of his own works, and judged by a human standard."— "Christ's Object Lessons," page 151.

5. "Overwhelmed with a sense of guilt, he stood as if alone in God's presence. His only desire was for pardon and peace, his only plea was the mercy of God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 152.

6. Each got what he wanted,— the Pharisee the notice and praise of men, the publican the forgiveness of God.

7. "There is nothing so offensive to God, or so dangerous to the human soul, as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless, the most incurable."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 154.

8. A shepherd, when asked the secret of his success in raising such a fine flock of sheep, said, "I take care of the lambs." How many to-day, like the disciples, say, in actions if not in words, that the work of God is too important to stop to give attention to the children. Children are hindered (1) by a lack of interest in religious things and proper religious instruction on the part of the parents in the home; (2) by neglect of their religious education; (3) by conduct of the church services with little or no regard to the lambs of the flock, thus making the church distasteful to them; (4) by criticism of the church and Christian workers in their presence; (5) by discouraging children from becoming Christians when young.
