## Notes

1. Note the various words of praise as reported by the evangelists: "Hosanna," "Hosanna to the son of David," "Blessed is He," "Blessed is the King," "Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord," "Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh in the name of the Lord," "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest," "Hosanna in the highest."

2. "Never before in His earthly life had Jesus permitted such a demonstration. He clearly foresaw the result. It would bring Him to the cross. But it was His purpose thus publicly to present Himself as the Redeemer. He desired to call attention to the sacrifice that was to crown His mission to a fallen world. While the people were assembling at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, He, the antitypical Lamb, by a voluntary act set Himself apart as an oblation. It would be needful for His church in all succeeding ages to make His death for the sins of the world a subject of deep thought and study. Every fact connected with it should be verified beyond a doubt. It was necessary, then, that the eyes of all people should now be directed to Him; the events which preceded His great sacrifice must be such as to call attention to the sacrifice itself. After such a demonstration as that attending His entry into Jerusalem, all eyes would follow His rapid progress to the final scene."—"Desire of Ages," page 571.

3. "That might have seemed the proudest moment in the life of Jesus, the moment when the homage of man was most spontaneous and most real; but in truth it was one of the saddest. The enthusiasm only deepened His solitude, made it more awful to His spirit, while throwing upon the coming events a more tragic coloring. Their praise was pain; for what they praised was the idol of their own imaginations, not the Christ who was coming to suffer and die. In the midst of their joy He rode possessed of the vivid consciousness that the discovery of the truth would change their jubilant cry of welcome into the delirious shout of passion and revenge. So, as they swept round the shoulder of the hill, and the city burst upon His view, turreted, temple-crowned, lying white and radiant in the glorious sunlight, hallowed by a thousand sacred memories, darkened by a thousand sins, the pathos of the place and the moment, the then and the to be, the ideal and the actual, the men and the city as they seemed and as they were, was more than His heart could bear, and He wept, saying, 'If thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.'"—"Fairbairn: Studies in the Life of Christ," pages 231, 232.

4. "Again the piercing look of Jesus swept over the desecrated court of the temple. All eyes were turned toward Him. Priest and ruler, Pharisee and Gentile, looked with astonishment and awe upon Him who stood before them with the majesty of heaven's King. Divinity flashed through humanity, investing Christ with a dignity and glory He had never manifested before. Those standing nearest Him drew as far away as the crowd would permit. Except for a few of His disciples, the Saviour stood alone. Every sound was hushed. The deep silence seemed unbearable. Christ spoke with a power that swayed the people like a mighty tempest: 'It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.' His voice sounded like a trumpet through the temple. The displeasure of His countenance seemed like consuming fire. With authority He commanded, 'Take these things hence.'"—"Desire of Ages," pages 590, 591.

5. "As Jesus in the temple [when twelve years old] solved the mysteries which priests and rulers had not discerned, so in the closing work of this earth, children who have been rightly educated will in their simplicity speak words which will be an astonishment to men who now talk of 'higher education.' As the children sang in the temple courts, 'Hosanna! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,' so in these last days, children's voices will be raised to give the last message of warning to a perishing world."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, pages 202, 203.
