## Notes

1. The Feast of Dedication was instituted by Judas Maccabeus in 164 B.C. in celebration of the redevotion of the temple to the worship of Jehovah, after it had been polluted by heathen sacrifices by Antiochus Epiphanes. The feast began on the 25th of the month Chisleu (November-December), and lasted eight days. It did not require attendance at Jerusalem. It was an occasion of much festivity.

2. Solomon's porch was the colonnade on the east side of the temple. See Acts 3:11; 5:12.

3. Geikie explains this passage by the following paraphrase: "Is it not written in your law of the rulers of Israel, the representatives and earthly embodiments of the majesty of Jehovah, your invisible King, 'I said, Ye are gods'? If God Himself called them gods, to whom this utterance of His came — and you cannot deny the authority of Scripture — how can you say of Me, whom the Father has consecrated to a far higher office than ruler, or even prophet, to that of Messiah; and whom He has not only thus set apart to this great office, but sent into the world, clothed with mighty powers I have shown, and the fulness of grace and truth you now see in Me, — that I blaspheme, because I have said I am God's Son?" — "Life and Words of Christ," Vol. 2, page 308.

4. If they could not believe the words, let them believe the works. Recognizing the work as that of the Father, they would come to understand that the Father worked through Him.

5. The statement in verse 30 may refer not only to the coming in of the Gentiles, but to the general truth that in that day human judgment will often be reversed.

6. "Jesus had now been for some time in Perea, in the territory of Antipas, the murderer of John. The intense unpopularity of the crime had, doubtless, been a protection to Him; but, besides the fact than Antipas personally feared the great Miracle-worker, thinking He was perhaps the murdered Baptist, risen from the dead, there were many other reasons why he should wish Him fairly out of his dominions. Unwilling to appear in the matter, he used the Pharisees, counting on their readiness to further his end. Some of their number, therefore, came to Christ, with the air of friends anxious for His safety, and warned Him that it would be well for Him to leave Perea as quickly as possible, as Herod desired to kill Him.

"Jesus at once saw through the whole design, as a crafty plan of Herod for His expulsion. But He was on His way to Jerusalem, and contented Himself with showing that He gave no ground for political suspicion, and that He quite well understood how little friendship there was in the advice the Pharisees had given Him." — Geikie: "Life and Words of Christ," Vol. 2, page 343.
