## Notes

1. The ceremony of pouring out the water, which commemorated the smitten rock, was performed each morning during the feast. "Few, if any, have doubted that it was with direct allusion to this daily pouring out of the waters of Siloam, which was so striking a feature of the festival, that on the last, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, 'If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.' Your forefathers thirsted in the wilderness, and I smote the rock for them, so that the waters flowed forth. . . . Did not Isaiah tell you, when in My name he spake, saying, 'I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring'? . . . And now I am here to fulfil in person all the promises that I made by the lips of My servant Isaiah, and I gather them up and condense them in the invitation, 'If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.'" — Hanna: "Life of Christ," page 371.

2. "He that believeth shall not barely and alone have his own thirst assuaged; but I in him, by My Spirit given, molding him into My own likeness, shall turn him into a separate well-head, from whose depths rivers of living water shall flow forth to visit, gladden, fructify some lesser or larger portion of the arid waste around. Let us know and remember, then, that Jesus, the divine Assuager of the thirst of human hearts, imparts the blessing to each who comes to Him, that he may go and impart the blessing to others." — Id., page 372.

3. "Hardened as were their hearts, they were melted by His words. While He was speaking in the temple court, they had lingered near, to catch something that might be turned against Him. But as they listened, the purpose for which they had been sent was forgotten. They stood as men entranced. Christ revealed Himself to their souls. They saw that which priests and rulers would not see, — humanity flooded with the glory of divinity. They returned, so filled with this thought, so impressed by His words, that to the inquiry, 'Why have ye not brought Him?' they could only reply, 'Never man spake like this man.'" — "Desire of Ages," page 459.

4. The close connection between the last verse of chapter seven and the first verse of chapter eight is somewhat obscured by the division into chapters. While every man retired to the comforts of his own home, the Master went into the mountain to pray and seek strength for His work.

5. Like the Pharisees and Herodians at a later time in asking Jesus about paying tribute to Caesar, the Pharisees by this question meant to place Him in a dilemma. If He does not uphold the Mosaic law, they reason, He will forfeit the respect of the people. If He does, He will be advising a breach of the Roman law.
