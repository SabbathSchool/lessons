## Notes

1. The Feast of Tabernacles "was pre-eminently the feast for foreign pilgrims" (Edersheim), and many had come from all parts of the world hoping to see Jesus, who claimed to be the Messiah, and of whose mighty miracles they had heard. Jesus had not attended the national gatherings since the healing of the man at the pool of Bethesda. ("Desire of Ages," page 450.) Some of the people of Jerusalem doubtless knew of the decision of the members of the Sanhedrin at that time to put Him to death. So there was a general feeling of expectancy concerning Him among those who attended this last great feast of the year.

2. "Letters" is literature. "To the Jews there was only one kind of learning — that of theology; and only one road to it — the schools of the rabbis. Their major was true, but their minor false — and Jesus hastened to correct it. He had, indeed, 'learned,' but in a school quite other than those which alone they recognized." — Edersheim: "The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," Vol. 2, page 151.

3. "It was a settled popular belief, and, in a sense, not quite unfounded, that the appearance of the Messiah would be sudden and unexpected. He might be there, and not be known; or He might come, and be again hidden for a time. As they put it, when Messiah came no one would know whence He was; but they all knew 'whence this One' was. And with this rough and ready argument of a coarse realism, they, like so many among us, settled off-hand and once for all the great question." — Id., Vol. 2, page 154.

4. Like the suggestion of the high priest at a later time (John 11:49-51), the query of the Jews was prophetic. "In their mocking words they were picturing the mission of Christ."
