## Notes

1. It was not because that generation living at the time of the Flood had not heard the warning of the coming Deluge. They had heard it so long that it had become to them an old story. They "knew not" because they believed not God's message. Having cast aside God's Word as uncertain, they at last looked upon Noah's work as a delusion, and the Flood came to them as a surprise. So will it be in the end of the world. For further study, see "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 95-97.

2. "Jesus has left us word, 'Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.' We are waiting and watching for the return of the Master, who is to bring the morning, lest coming suddenly He find us sleeping. What time is here referred to? Not to the revelation of Christ in the clouds of heaven to find a people asleep. No; but to His return from His ministration in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, when He lays off His priestly attire, and clothes Himself with garments of vengeance, and when the mandate goes forth, 'He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; ... and he that is holy, let him be holy still.'"—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, page 190.

3. "Probation closes; Christ's intercessions cease in heaven. This time finally comes suddenly upon all, and those who have neglected to purify their souls by obeying the truth, are found sleeping. They became weary of waiting and watching; they became indifferent in regard to the coming of their Master... While their interest was buried up in their worldly gains, the work closed in the heavenly sanctuary, and they were unprepared. If such had only known that the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary would close so soon, how differently would they have conducted themselves! how earnestly would they have watched! The Master anticipating all this, gives them timely warning in the command to watch. He distinctly states the suddenness of His coming. He does not measure the time, lest we shall neglect a momentary preparation, and in our indolence look ahead to the time when we think He will come, and defer the preparation."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, page 191.

4. "Trumbull, attending an Oriental wedding, saw the bride's procession in the afternoon. He was told the bridegroom's procession would move out later in the evening. He watched for it several hours, and seeing no sign thereof he went quietly to bed in his tent. But at midnight there was a cry made, 'Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him'— literally the substance of his dragoman's call."—Peloubet's Notes, 1901.

5. "The reply is not selfish, even in the figure, for there was not enough for us and you. To have divided the oil would have entirely defeated the purpose of the procession." "Personal character cannot be given by one man to another... There is much, indeed, we can and ought to do for each other. But we cannot give to any one the qualities which we ourselves possess, but in which he is deficient."—Peloubet's Notes, 1901.

6. A modern missionary, describing a Hindu wedding, closes by telling how when the bridegroom went into the house, the door "was immediately shut and guarded by sepoys. I and others expostulated with the doorkeepers, but in vain. Never was I so struck with our Lord's beautiful parable as at this moment — and the door was shut."—Barnes's Notes, volume 1, page 314.

In studying this parable, it will be observed that all the virgins took lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. All had some oil. All waited for him. But as the bridegroom tarried longer than they thought he would, all went to sleep. All arose at midnight. All trimmed their lamps. Here the separation takes place. Only five now had oil. And only those who had oil and were ready went in before the door was shut.
