## Notes

1. "Into the common hall," or the pretorium, or governor's house. (See margin.) The whole band, or cohort, gathered together to mock Jesus. He had endured six trials; before Annas, before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin at night, before the same body in the morning, before Pilate, before Herod, and again before Pilate. At last, to appease the mob, sentence is given against Him. Yet after all this, Pilate puts forth one more effort to save the Prisoner whom he feared, and knew was innocent.

2. Once more Pilate seeks to release Jesus. Once more he declares, "I find no fault in Him." Once more he halts, waits, hesitates, falters, fails.

"'Behold the Man!' It is probable that Pilate pointed to the Saviour, and his object evidently was to move them to compassion, and to convince them, by a sight of the Saviour Himself, that He was innocent. . . . The conduct of Pilate was as if he had said, 'See! The Man whom you accuse is arrayed in a gorgeous robe, as if a king. He has been scourged and mocked. All this He has borne with patience. See! How calm and peaceful! Behold His countenance! How mild! His body scourged, His head pierced with thorns! Yet in all this He is meek and patient. This is the Man that you accuse; and He is now brought forth, that you may see that He is not guilty.'" — Barnes's Notes on John, 19.

3. "Judgment-seat. The tribunal or place of pronouncing sentence. He came here to deliver Him, in due form of law, into the hands of the Jews.

"Pavement. This was an area or room of the judgment-hall whose floor was made of small square stones of various colors. This was common in palaces and houses of wealth and splendor.

"Gabbatha. This word is not elsewhere used. It comes from a word signifying to be elevated. The name given to the place by the Hebrews was conferred from its being the place of the tribunal; as an elevated place." — Barnes.

4. Pilate had before this delivered Jesus to his soldiers to be crucified. Yet he makes one more attempt to move the Jews to pity and release Jesus. But their heart is closed to pity, and they even repudiate God's rulership over them. They had rejected God's Representative, and had demanded His death, and said, "His blood be upon us and upon our children;" and finally, as the climax of rebellion, they repudiated Jehovah their King, by declaring, "We have no king but Caesar."

5. "The name [Golgotha] can not have been derived from the skulls which lay about, since such exposure would have been unlawful, and hence must have been due to the skull-like shape and appearance of the place. Accordingly, the name is commonly explained as the Greek form of the Aramean Gulgalta, or the Hebrew Gulgoleth, which means a skull." — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 585.

6. "'For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry.' By the green tree, Jesus represented Himself, the innocent Redeemer. God suffered His wrath against transgression to fall on His beloved Son. Jesus was to be crucified for the sins of men. What suffering, then, would the sinner bear who continued in sin? All the impenitent and unbelieving would know a sorrow and misery that language would fail to express." — "Desire of Ages," chapter 78, page 743.

"For, if Israel had put such flame to its 'green tree,' how terribly would the divine judgment burn among the dry wood of an apostate and rebellious people, that had so delivered up its divine King, and pronounced sentence upon itself by pronouncing it upon Him!" — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 588.

7. "It was a merciful Jewish practice to give to those led to execution a draught of strong wine mixed with myrrh, so as to deaden consciousness. This charitable office was performed at the cost of, if not by, an association of women in Jerusalem. That draught was offered to Jesus when He reached Golgotha. But having tasted it, and ascertained its character and object, He would not drink it. It was like His former refusal of the pity of the 'daughters of Jerusalem.'" — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, pages 589, 590.
