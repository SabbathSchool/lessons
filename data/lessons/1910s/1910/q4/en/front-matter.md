## Sabbath-School Lessons on the LIFE OF CHRIST

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

These lessons conclude the series on the life of Christ. The closing days of the life of our Lord upon earth are of special interest. Every word is pregnant with meaning. The lessons are worthy of earnest, prayerful study. Let the scenes described, the pictures drawn, stand before us in all their vivid reality. Let us forget ourselves for the time, and in our imagination, guided by the Spirit of God, dwell in Judea and see the chief Actor in His closing work on earth for the children of men — from the dark hours of Gethsemane to His death upon the cross and His ascension to the Father — and then let the soul appreciate the fact that all this was for us — for me.

No parallel scriptures have been given, as the four Gospels have been taken as the lesson scripture.

These lessons are sent forth to our Sabbath-schools with the prayer that the life of the Master may be transmuted into the lives of all our people.
