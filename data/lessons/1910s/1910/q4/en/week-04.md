## Notes

1. This seems to have been a formal meeting of the Sanhedrin in the morning for the passing of the legal sentence, and approving the acts of the night previous.

2. The confession of Judas was in effect a clear charge against the priests and elders of bribery. Thirty pieces of silver was the price of a slave. Ex. 21:32.

3. The Sanhedrin had condemned Jesus for blasphemy, but they could not put Him to death. They now wanted the death sentence passed by the Romans.

4. "The question which he [Pilate] addressed to them seems to have startled and disconcerted them. Their procedure had been private; it was of the very essence of proceedings at Roman law that they were in public. Again, the procedure before the sanhedrists had been in the form of a criminal investigation, while it was of the essence of Roman procedure to enter only on definite accusations." — Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 568.

5. Pilate's reply was a reminder to the Jews that they were a subject nation. It must have recalled to their minds the cause of their condition; namely, sin. Yet they were condemning the One who came to save them. Jesus was to be lifted up, and die upon the cross. This implied crucifixion, and the Romans now used this mode of punishment. The Jews would have stoned Him to death.

6. "Pilate at this time had no thought of condemning Jesus. He knew that the Jews had accused Him through hatred and prejudice. He knew what his duty was. Justice demanded that Christ should be immediately released. But Pilate dreaded the ill will of the people. Should he refuse to give Jesus into their hands, a tumult would be raised, and this he feared to meet." — "Desire of Ages," chapter 77, page 728.
