## Notes

1. Sin separated between God and man, but in the gospel the provision is made whereby we can draw near to God. In the typical service of the earthly sanctuary this provision was set forth in figure. When the glory of God was revealed as a consuming fire the great truth was taught that neither sin nor sinners could endure the presence of God, and the need of separation from sin in order to dwell with God was emphasized.

2. The veil which separated the holy from the most holy place also protected the priests from being consumed by the manifestation of the glory of God in the most holy place, and they were therefore able to draw near and to minister in the holy place. When the high priest entered into the most holy place, the cloud of incense served the same purpose, and enabled him to draw near to the mercy-seat, and to make the atonement for the people who were represented by him.

3. In order that the glory of God might be manifested among men without consuming them, the Son of God veiled His divinity with the veil of the flesh. When divinity broke through this veil, then the glory became, as of old, a consuming fire, and men were terrified by the sight.

4. The way into the holy place of the heavenly sanctuary was opened when Jesus ascended on high and became a Minister of the true tabernacle; but in the closing work of the gospel, His ministry is transferred to the most holy place, as is indicated by the fact that the ark of His covenant was visible in the temple.

5. Jesus has not laid aside the veil of His flesh; and hidden in Him, and protected by this veil, believers may enter into the sanctuary, and draw near to God, even into the most holy place, without being consumed. Every one who accepts Christ as his Mediator, is exhorted thus to draw near to God. Only those, however, who understand the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, can intelligently avail themselves of this great privilege.
