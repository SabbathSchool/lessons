## Notes

1. The law of God is called the testimony because it bears testimony either to sin or to righteousness. The two tables of stone are called the tables of testimony because the testimony or the law was written upon them. And the ark was called the ark of the testimony because the testimony, or the law, was deposited in it. In the 119th psalm, "testimonies," "commandments," "precepts," "statutes," "ordinances," "judgments," "word," and "law" are all used to designate the same thing.

2. The Greek word which is translated "propitiation" in Rom. 3:25 is the same word as is translated "mercy-seat" in Heb. 9:5. The same Greek word is used in the Greek translation of the Old Testament to represent the Hebrew word translated "mercy-seat" in the English version. In the typical service, the mercy-seat was between the law and the people, and they dealt with the law over the mercy-seat. In the real service, Christ is the mercy-seat between the law and the people, and they deal with the law through Christ.

3. Through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, all blessings are bestowed. Grace, mercy, and love, which come in this way, are not abstract qualities, but are the very spirit of life in Christ Jesus; and they are made manifest in a life in harmony with the law of God, just as Christ lived that law on earth.

4. The writing of the law of God in the heart, and the dwelling of Christ in the heart, are simply different forms of expression for the same experience. They both involve the restoration of the image of God in the soul of the believer.
