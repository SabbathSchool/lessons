## Notes

1. When Jesus was "at the right hand of God exalted," He "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens," as a minister of the heavenly sanctuary; and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was the evidence upon earth that His work of intercession in behalf of man in the sanctuary above had commenced. The minds of the disciples, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, grasped the great fact that their former Companion and Friend was now their High Priest in the heavenly courts.

2. From the texts used in answering questions 9, 10, and 11, it is evident that the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews used the expressions "within the veil," "into the holy place," and "into heaven itself" as conveying the same general meaning; namely, as designating the sanctuary in heaven as the place where Jesus had entered upon His work as High Priest. When he referred to the hanging which separated the holy from the most holy place he called it the second veil. The hanging at the entrance of the holy place would therefore necessarily be the first veil.

3. In this epistle, the word "veil" is applied in three different ways: first, it is used in chapter 6:19 in the expression "within the veil," which denotes the sanctuary as a whole; second, it is used in the expression "the second veil" (Heb. 9:3) to designate the hanging between the holy and the most holy place; and third, it is used in chapter 10:20 as meaning "His flesh." It is therefore manifestly unsafe to give to the word "veil" in Heb. 6:19, 20 the limited and technical meaning which attaches to the expression "within the veil" in some cases in the Old Testament, where definite reference had already been made to the hanging between the holy and the most holy place in other statements.

4. The whole ceremonial system was a shadow of good things which were yet future while that system was in force by divine appointment. To say that the ministry in the holy place of the heavenly sanctuary was in progress during the four thousand years before the cross, not only involves the incongruity of having the typical service introduced twenty-five hundred years after the real service was instituted, but it is also a plain contradiction of the teaching of the Scriptures.

5. The first comma in verse 11 should be omitted, and the phrase "through the greater and more perfect tabernacle" (R. V.) should be connected directly with the verb "to come." This is the punctuation of the revised Greek text. "The greater and more perfect tabernacle" through which these good things were to come would then refer to the heavenly sanctuary.

6. The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary was accomplished on the great day of atonement, which came at the end of the yearly round of services, and the vital part of this special service was carried on in the most holy place of the sanctuary. What was true of the type is true also of the reality. The cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary is accomplished on the great day of atonement, and this service is carried on in the most holy place. But according to the prophecy of Daniel (Dan. 8:13, 14), the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary commenced at the end of the twenty-three hundred days (or in 1844), and therefore the ministry in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary began at that time. To say that Christ entered upon His ministry in the most holy place when He ascended, would involve a plain contradiction of the statement in this prophecy.
