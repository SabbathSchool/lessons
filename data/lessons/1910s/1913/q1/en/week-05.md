## Notes

1. It is very important that we should have a clear understanding of the relation of the incarnation of Christ to His mediatorial work. He was made priest "after the power of an endless life," in order that He might minister grace, mercy, and power to the weak and erring. This is accomplished by making such a close union with those needing help, that divinity and humanity are brought into personal relation, and the very Spirit and life of God dwell in the flesh of the believer. In order to establish this relation between God and sinful flesh, it was necessary for the Son of God to take sinful flesh; and thus was bridged the gulf which separated sinful man from God.

"In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.' He gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature. This is the pledge that God will fulfil His word. 'Unto us a Child is born; unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder.' God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same into the highest heaven. It is the 'Son of man' who shares the throne of the universe. It is the 'Son of man' whose name shall be called 'Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.' The I AM is the Daysman between God and humanity, laying His hand upon both. He who is 'holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,' is not ashamed to call us brethren. In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother. Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is infolded in the bosom of Infinite Love."—"Desire of Ages," pages 25, 26.

By its dogma concerning the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, the Roman Catholic Church gives to the Son of God in the incarnation a "perfect human nature," and thereby separates Him from those whom He came to save. Note this extract: "Who can believe that, it being in the power of God the Son to prepare a spotless holy temple wherein to dwell incarnate for nine months, He preferred to have one which had been first profaned by the stain of original sin?"—"Catholic Belief," page 218.

This denial of the perfect union of Christ with sinful flesh opens the way for a series of subsidiary mediators whose duty it is to bring the sinner into saving touch with Christ. Here is the proof of this statement: Catholics "believe that union with Jesus Christ is the highest and noblest aim of man, and that only the Holy Catholic Church supplies the means for this union with Jesus Christ"—Id., page 33.

2. The Son of God manifested Himself in behalf of man in ancient times, as to Abraham (Genesis 18), to Moses (Exodus 3), to Joshua (Joshua 5:13-15), etc.; but in order that He should become a great High Priest to minister in the heavenly sanctuary, "to make reconciliation for the sins of the people," it was necessary that He should take the flesh of, and in all things "be made like unto His brethren." Here is revealed "the mystery of godliness."

3. By assuming sinful flesh, and voluntarily making Himself dependent upon His Father to keep Him from sin while He was in the world, Jesus not only set the example for all Christians, but also made it possible for Him to minister to sinful flesh the gift of His own Spirit and the power for obedience to the will of God. By this union with the human family in their state of weakness and dependence, He became "a merciful and faithful High Priest," who can "be touched with the feeling of our infirmities," having been "in all points tempted like as we are."
