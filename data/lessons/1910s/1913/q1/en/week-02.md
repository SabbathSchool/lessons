## Notes

1. "The Lord possessed Me as the beginning of His way." In all the creative work, "I was by Him, as a master workman." Prov. 8:22, 30, R. V., margin. The eternal Son, the Wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:24), was the channel through which every revelation of God was made, and the agent through whom the Father wrought in all His working. He was thus the Mediator between the Father and all that is, using the word "mediator" in its broad sense as meaning "one who is a means of intercourse between two other parties, and through whom action passes from either to other." It thus appears that the mediation of Christ grew out of the very nature of His being and His relation to the Father as the eternal Son; and the great truth that it was through the mediation of the Son that God wrought in the original creation, when all things were brought into being, becomes the pillar and ground of the central principle of the gospel — the mediatorial principle.

2. The gospel provision for mediation in behalf of man after sin had entered into the world, did not require the introduction of a new principle into the divine administration, but simply a new application of a principle already in operation. "The restriction of the thought of mediatorship and sacrifice to the gracious intervention of the eternal Son on behalf of fallen and sinful man, has narrowed and thrown out of proportion our thought of the dignity and glory of the Son, and of the grandeur of His work. Sin, of course, brings another element into worship and sacrifice. Sin creates a gulf between the creature and God; and only a mediator, a priest, can bring the creature back to God even when it wills to be brought, or can make atonement and satisfaction on its behalf for the injury and wrong done to the majesty of the supreme Lawgiver by an act of disobedience. There is a new need, that of expiation; and there is a greater, and to us a more evident, need of a mediator.

"But the standing truth, that from the first instant of creation there has been a Mediator between the Father and creation, One through whom, necessarily, creation came into being, renders it easier for us to apprehend alike the necessity, and (such is the love of God) the probability, of an atoning Mediator who should undo the mischief of sin; and, this being so, the impossibility that it can be any other than the uncreated Mediator, through whom and for whom were all things made, the eternal Son."—"The One Mediator," P. G. Medd, M.A., London, 1884, page 69.

3. It was through the mediation of the Son of God that all things were brought into existence, and it is through the same mediation that all things are upheld. Heb. 1:3. The Son was and is the Mediator (in this larger sense) for all unfallen beings, through whom they were created and through whom they are sustained in life. He was the Mediator for the human family before sin entered into the world; and in order to carry on this mediation in behalf of man and restore him to fellowship with God, it was necessary that the Son should take the flesh (Heb. 2:14, 15), and thus He became the Man Christ Jesus, the Mediator between God and sinful man. Thus He who was the Mediator in the original creation, is the Mediator in the new creation; and the fact of the original creation is the promise of the new creation.

The full truth concerning the mediation of Christ, precludes the possibility of there being any other mediator between God and man, as He only can mediate in the new creation who was the Mediator in the original creation. No created being can act as mediator for sin, and this shuts out the whole mediatorial system of the papacy.
