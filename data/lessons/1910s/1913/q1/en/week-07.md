## Notes

1. The same God who is said to be the Builder of all things is also declared to be the Creator of all things; and this creative work is accomplished through the eternal Son, the Word of God. The work of building the church is also a creative work (2 Cor. 5:17, R.V., margin), and this is accomplished through the mediation of the same eternal Son.

2. An earthly house or family is built up by having children born into the family. This is emphasized in the Hebrew language in the fact that the root of the verb "to build" and the root of the noun "son" are the same.

3. Jesus was none the less the Son of God after He had been born in the flesh through the agency of the Holy Spirit. Luke 1:35. He was both Son of man, or Son of David, and the Son of God. Through His mediatorial work as priest, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, all believers are born again as children of God (1 John 3:1), and the house of God is thus built.
