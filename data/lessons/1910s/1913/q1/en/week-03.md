## Notes

1. There is a very close connection between the working of God in nature and His working in grace. Through the mediation of the eternal Son, the power of God is manifested in upholding all things and in preserving order throughout the material universe. Were it not for the constant working of this power, there would be chaos in the universe, and the character of God would be impugned. Whatever names may have been given to the manifestation of the power of God in nature, such as "adhesion," "cohesion," "gravity," "gravitation," etc., it is well to remember that all things hold together in Christ, and this fact is made the basis of confidence in the power of God to uphold all those who put their trust in Him.

2. Christ did not become a priest on account of the operation of that law of the priesthood which made one a priest who was a descendant of Aaron after the flesh, but His priesthood grew out of "the power of an endless life," out of the eternity of His being. He was able to swallow up death, and to minister life to all, because He had life in Himself.

3. While the typical service was a temporary object-lesson, and was perverted into formalism, yet it was designed to teach the truths of salvation through faith in Christ, the One to whom all the typical ritual pointed. The experience of present salvation from sin was real to one who entered into that typical service in the spirit of it, and who exercised that faith in a personal Redeemer which the sanctuary service was intended to teach. It was the perversion of the Levitical system which interfered with the purpose of God in giving it to His people.

4. "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was burned upon the altar, with its appropriate meat-offering, thus symbolizing the daily consecration of the nation to Jehovah, and their constant dependence upon the atoning blood of Christ. . . . The incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the merits and intercession of Christ, His perfect righteousness, which through faith is imputed to His people, and which can alone make the worship of sinful beings acceptable to God. Before the veil of the most holy place was an altar of perpetual intercession; before the holy, an altar of continual atonement. By blood and by incense God was to be approached,— symbols pointing to the great Mediator, through whom sinners may approach Jehovah, and through whom alone mercy and salvation can be granted to the repentant, believing soul."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 352, 353.

5. The mediation of Christ is a continual mediation, both in nature and in grace, and the sacrifice which He offered was one sacrifice which was itself continual. The phrase which is translated "forever" in Heb. 10:12 is the very same phrase which is translated "continually" in verse one of the same chapter. The very nature of Christ's mediation forbids the substitution of any human system of mediation, such as that of the papacy, in its place; and the very nature of the one sacrifice for sin, which is continual, renders both unnecessary and impossible such a pretended sacrifice as that of the mass. Christ Himself is both priest and sacrifice in fulfilment of all types and shadows of the Levitical system, and there can now be no other.
