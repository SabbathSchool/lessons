## Notes

1. "The union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ, exists also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God;' yet they are expressed in the words of men, and are adapted to human needs. Thus it may be said of the Book of God, as it was of Christ, that 'the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.' And this fact, so far from being an argument against the Bible, should strengthen faith in it as the Word of God. Those who pronounce upon the inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as divine, while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact that Christ, the divine, partook of our human nature, that He might reach humanity. In the work of God for man's redemption, divinity and humanity are combined."—Testimonies for the Church, No. 33, pages 275, 276.

Such, then, is God's Book. Its first line, its last line, all its teachings, understood or not understood, are by the same author; and that ought to suffice us. Whoever may have been the writers—whatever their circumstances, their impressions, their comprehension of the Book, and the measure of their individuality in this powerful and mysterious operation—they have all written faithfully and under superintendence in the same roll, under the guidance of one and the same Master, for whom a thousand years are as one day; and the result has been the Bible. Therefore I will not lose time in idle questions; I will study the book. It is the word of Moses, the word of Amos, the word of John, the word of Paul; but still the thoughts expressed are God's thoughts, and the words are God's words. "Thou, Lord, hast spoken by the mouth of Thy servant David." "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me," said he, "and His word was in my tongue."—L. Gaussen on the Inspiration of the Bible, page 31.

2. "God hath spoken! The words of a man carry weight according to the idea I have of his wisdom, his veracity, his power, his love. The words of God! Oh, who can express what they ought to be worth to us! Each word carries with it all the life of God, all His saving power and love. . . . The words of men have often exerted a wonderful and a mighty influence. But the words of God—they are creative deeds, they give what they speak. . . . Men's words appeal to the mind or the will, the feelings or the passions. God speaks to that which is deeper than all—to the heart, that central depth within us whence are the issues of life. Let us believe the mighty, quickening power God's Word will have."—Andrew Murray.

3. John the Baptist was "the voice of one crying in the wilderness." When the time came for God's message for that generation to be delivered, "the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness," and he immediately went forth to speak that word. He openly rebuked the sin and the formalism of his time, and sought to restore the pure word of God in the hearts of the people. Thus he was delivering the message given through the prophet Isaiah, "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. . . . The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever. . . . Behold your God." In this closing generation a work corresponding to the work of John the Baptist is to be carried to completion, and in this great second advent movement the Word of God in its purity and power must be given its rightful place. This is the fundamental thing in the Third Angel's Message. Thus will the tabernacle of David be built again. Acts 15:13-17.

"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
