## Notes

1. That "the Word" of John 1:1 is the Son of God is further evident from Rev. 19:11-16. In Rev. 17:14, it is stated that the Lamb is "Lord of lords, and King of kings," and the Son of God in the flesh was pointed out by John the Baptist as "the Lamb of God." John 1:36.

2. The whole of the first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews is occupied with the teaching of the Old Testament Scriptures concerning the being and character of the Son of God, who, in the second chapter, is called "Jesus," and of whom it is declared that "in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren." In the first chapter there are seven quotations from the Old Testament, each one of which testifies to the superiority of the Son. The whole chapter should be studied in this connection.

3. As further showing His own claim to the divine nature, it will be profitable to consider such statements of Jesus as are found in John 6:48; 8:12; 10:11; 11:25; 14:6; and 15:1. In these declarations Jesus is simply interpreting the meaning of the I AM of Ex. 3:14.

General Note.â€”Those who have the time to pursue this subject further may profitably study those instances where Christ appeared to men before His incarnation. Some of these are Christ and Abraham (Genesis 17), Christ at Sinai, Christ and Joshua (Joshua 5:13-15), Christ and Gideon (Judges 6:11-24).
