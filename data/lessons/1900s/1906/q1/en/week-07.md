## Notes

1. "Christ never worked a miracle except to supply a genuine necessity, and every miracle was of a character to lead the people to the tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations."—Desire or Ages, page 366.

2. Genuine, divine miracles, as brought to view in the Bible, are extraordinary or supernatural manifestations of divine power, to awaken an interest in divine things, and to lead men to a knowledge of the true God, and of Jesus Christ, whom He has sent to be the Saviour of the world.

3. Daniel and his three Hebrew companions came from Judea, and were of the royal line. Dan. 1:3, 6. From 2 Kings 22:14 and 2 Chron. 34:22, we learn there was a college or school of the prophets at Jerusalem shortly before the captivity. Whether Daniel and his companions actually attended this school or not, we are not informed; but if they did not, they and their parents were doubtless much influenced by the principles taught in it. At any rate, the early education of these youth taught them to believe in a God who could work miracles. And this is the education the children and youth need to-day.

4. "The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a state of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy intelligences, all waiting to do His will. Through channels which we can not discern, He is in active communication with every part of His dominion." "The angels of God are ever passing from earth to heaven, and from heaven to earth. The miracles of Christ for the afflicted and suffering were wrought by the power of God through the ministration of angels. And it is through Christ, by the ministration of His heavenly messengers, that every blessing comes from God to us."—Desire of Ages, pages 356, 143.

5. Miracles are of two kinds, good and bad. Satan also has power to work miracles. While he can not create, nor give life, he has studied "the secrets of the laboratories of nature," and by the use of things already created, he can, so far as God permits, perform wonders. But the Bible calls them "lying wonders." They are done to deceive, to lead men into sin, and to fasten them in deception.
