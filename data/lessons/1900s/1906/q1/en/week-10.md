## Notes

1. It is a proper thing to learn how to pray. In the schools of the prophets "a spirit of devotion was cherished. Not only were the students taught the duty of prayer, but they were taught how to pray, how to approach their Creator, how to exercise faith in Him, and how to understand and obey the teachings of the Spirit."—Education, page v. See also "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 596. Many fail to begin the day right. David said the Lord should hear his voice in the morning. Ps. 5:3. An appropriate and beautiful morning prayer will be found in "Steps to Christ," page 84. See note 6, of Lesson VIII. In "Testimonies," Vol. VI, page 324, the instruction is given in praying for the sick: "As you pray, speak to Christ as you would a trusted and much-loved friend."

2. What is known as the Lord's prayer is doubtless the briefest, most comprehensive, and most perfect prayer ever put into human language. It is indeed a model prayer, and should be learned and studied by all. Besides its address, adoration, and ascription of dominion, power, and glory to the Father in heaven, its petitions cover every human need. Like the first verse of the Bible, the stamp of divinity is upon it. It is beautiful in its simplicity, brevity, directness, clearness, and comprehensiveness. There are sermons in every expression in it. There is no other prayer like it, nor any to be compared to it.

3. From Elijah we may learn a lesson of both definiteness and earnestness in prayer. He prayed earnestly, and he prayed for a definite, particular thing; and God heard and answered his prayer. The Lord has instructed us to "hold convocations for prayer," asking Him to open the way for the truth to enter the strongholds of Satan; to "solicit prayer for the souls for whom we labor," and to "present them before the church as subjects for their supplication;" to "select another and still another soul" to be prayed for. And we have the assurance given us that "there are miracles to be wrought in genuine conversion, miracles that can not be discerned. The greatest men of the earth are not beyond the power of a wonder-working God."—Testimonies, Vol. VI, pages 80-82. May not parents with unconverted children gather a suggestion and encouragement from this?

4. As we near the close of earth's history, and enter the closing struggles of the great conflict between good and evil, would it not be a wise thing for God's people to follow the example set by David and Daniel, and pray three times a day, at evening, morning, and noon? Do not we need to pray as much as they?

5. "Many are zealous in religious services, while between them and their brethren are unhappy differences which they might reconcile. God requires them to do all in their power to restore harmony. Until they do this, He can not accept their services. The Christian's duty in this matter is clearly pointed out."—Desire of Ages, pages 310, 311.

6. In working out our salvation, much depends upon the spirit we cherish toward others. God has promised to treat us as we treat others. If we judge, we shall be judged. If we do not forgive, we shall not be forgiven. "With the merciful Thou wilt show Thyself merciful; . . . with the froward Thou wilt show Thyself froward." Ps. 18:25, 26, "For He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy." James 2:13. It is a fact worthy of note that the only part of the Lord's prayer upon which Christ commented after giving the prayer, is the expression, "and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." And His comment is: "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." Matt. 6:14, 15. This, therefore, must be a very important matter. We can not afford to harbor ill feelings in our hearts toward any.

"The advent message to all the world in this generation"—our watchword.
