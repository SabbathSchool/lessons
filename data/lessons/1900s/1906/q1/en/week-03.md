## Notes

1. A belief in God is fundamental in Christian experience, and upon a right conception of God depends all that pertains to the Christian life. We must believe both in His existence and in His character as He has revealed Himself in His Word.

2. "The revelation of Himself that God has given in His Word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding the nature of God; but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not been given us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God. Let not finite man attempt to interpret Him. Let none indulge in speculation regarding His nature. . . . Neither by searching the recesses of the earth, nor in vain endeavors to penetrate the mysteries of God's being, is wisdom found. It is found, rather, in humbly receiving the revelation that He has been pleased to give, and in conforming the life to His will."â€”Testimonies for the Church, Vol. VIII, pages 279, 280.

3. The fact that God is spirit does not militate against the idea that He is a real being. He is a spiritual being, but still a real, personal being, just as a spiritual body is a real body.

4. In presenting the plan of salvation for man, such a revelation is made of God as would be entirely inconsistent with any other conception of Him than as of a personal being. The love shown in the gift of His own Son, the justice and the mercy, the righteousness and the holiness, are all the attributes of a personal being, but could not be affirmed of an Infinite Power, or an Intelligent Energy. God's dealing with sin, as taught in the sanctuary and its services, testifies most convincingly to the fact that He is a personal Being.

The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
