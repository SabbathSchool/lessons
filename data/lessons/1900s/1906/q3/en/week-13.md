## Notes

1. The Lord blessed Abraham that he might be a blessing. For a like reason he blessed the Sabbath day, that it might be a blessing to man. The blessing of God placed on the Sabbath is just as real a thing as the blessing which He gives to man. But in order for us to enjoy this blessing it is necessary that we observe, as He has directed, the day He blessed.

2. We are to remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. Throughout the entire week we are to so plan our secular affairs that, when the Sabbath comes to us, we will be ready to receive it, and not desecrate its sanctity because of our forgetfulness. In this sense the fourth commandment, like the other nine, covers all the transactions of life during the entire seven days of the week.

3. The divine Sabbath law commands that man's work shall be done in the "six working days" (Ezek. 46:1). The first hour of the Sabbath is as holy as any other hour, and when the day begins our own work should end and the Lord's work only should be done. Many are so burdened with the "cares of this life" that they frequently violate the sanctity of the Sabbath at its beginning and at its close in order to do their own work. Those who do this grieve the Spirit, and fail of receiving the full blessing of the Sabbath-keeping.

There is no more fitting way to begin the Sabbath than, as its sacred hours draw near, to assemble the family, and, after singing, and reading God's blessed Word, engage in a season of prayer, invoking pardon for sin, and asking for a Sabbath blessing. Then as its closing moments draw nigh, offer a prayer of thanksgiving; and ask for strength for the coming week.

4. "When the Sabbath commences we should place a guard upon ourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by appropriating to our own use that time which is strictly the Lord's. We should not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to do, any manner of our own work for a livelihood, or anything which could have been done on the six working days. Friday is the day of preparation. Time can then be devoted to making the necessary preparation for the Sabbath, and to thinking and conversing about it. Nothing which will in the sight of heaven be regarded as a violation of the Holy Sabbath should be left unsaid or undone, to be said or done upon the Sabbath. God requires not only that we refrain from physical labor upon the Sabbath, but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes. The fourth commandment is virtually transgressed by conversing upon worldly things or by engaging in light and trifling conversation. Talking upon anything or everything which may come into the mind, is speaking our own words. Every deviation from right brings us into bondage and condemnation."â€”Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 2, pages 702, 703.

5. We are not to do our own ways, or our own pleasure, or speak our own words on the Sabbath. To think and plan regarding our secular business on the Sabbath, or permit our mind to dwell on things pertaining to worldly pleasure, is a violation of the Sabbath. The fourth commandment, like the other precepts, covers the thoughts and intents of the heart, and when the Sabbath begins there should be a cessation, not simply of secular labor, but of secular thoughts as well.
