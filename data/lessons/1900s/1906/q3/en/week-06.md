## Notes

1. Moses was under the instruction of his mother until about twelve years of age. The godly instruction imparted during these years laid the foundation for the noble and unparalleled career of this mighty man. It enabled him to live amid the splendor and idolatry of the court of the Pharaohs, and to receive the education of a statesman, yet to maintain in his heart the pure precepts of the religion of the Most High. What a noble example for mothers.

2. "Then there is nothing else that so sweetens the home life. True family worship is a fountain that brings streams of holy influence into every part of the household. It is a vase of perfume that sheds fragrance over all. It softens asperities. It quells anger. It quiets impatience. It settles differences. It subdues evil passions. Hearts that are drawn together at God's feet every day can not get very far apart. The frictions of the day are forgotten when all voices mingle in the same heavenly song. As the tender words of inspiration fall with their benign counsels all feeling of unkindness melts away. The altar in the midst wondrously hallows and sweetens the home fellowship. Besides, it puts new strength into every heart. It comforts sorrow. It is a shield against temptation. It smooths out the wrinkles of care. It inspires strength for burden-bearing. It quickens every religious sentiment and keeps the fires burning on every heart's altar."—Week Day Religion, page 79.

3. "The hour for joyful, happy songs of praise to God and His dear Son had come. Satan had led the heavenly choir. He had raised the first note, then all the angelic host united with him, and glorious strains of music had resounded through heaven in honor of God and His dear Son. But now, instead of strains of sweetest music, discord and angry words fall upon the ear of the great rebel leader. Where was he? Was it not all a horrible dream? Was he shut out of heaven? Were the gates of heaven never more to open and admit him? The hour of worship draws nigh, when bright and holy angels bow before the Father. No more will he unite in heavenly song. No more will he bow in reverence and holy awe before the presence of the eternal God. Could he be again as he was when he was pure, true, and loyal, gladly would he yield up the claims of his authority. But he was lost, beyond redemption, for his presumptuous rebellion!"—Spirit of Prophecy, page 28.

4. "Morning and evening, the father, as priest of the household, should confess to God the sins committed by himself and his children through the day. Those sins which have come to his knowledge, and also those which are secret, of which God's eye alone has taken cognizance, should be confessed. This rule of action, zealously carried out by the father when he is present or by the mother when he is absent, will result in blessings to the family."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 2, page 701.

"The father, who is the 'house-band' of the family, will bind his children to the throne of God by living faith. Distrusting his own strength, he hangs his helpless soul on Jesus, and takes hold of the strength of the Most High. Brethren, pray at home, in your family, night and morning; pray earnestly in your closet; and while engaged in your daily labor, lift up your soul to God in prayer. It was thus that Enoch walked with God."—Idem, Vol. 4, page 616.

5. "We never need to distrust God. The just Judge repulses no one who comes to Him in contrition. He has more pleasure in His church struggling with temptation here below, than in the imposing host of angels that surround His throne. Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial choir God hears the cries of the weakest human being."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Signs of Times Sept. 15, 1898.
