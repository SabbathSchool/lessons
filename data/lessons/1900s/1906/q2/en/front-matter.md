## A STUDY OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN FOR SENIOR CLASSES

SECOND QUARTER, 1906

## General Note

The main characteristics of this epistle, says Barnes, are these: 
1. It is full of love. The writer dwells on it; places it in a variety of attitudes; enforces the duty of loving one another by a great variety of considerations, and shows that it is essential to the very nature of religion. 
2. The epistle abounds with statements on the evidences of piety, or the characteristics of true religion. A large part of the epistle is occupied with this, and there is perhaps no portion of the New Testament which one who is desirous of ascertaining whether he himself is a true Christian could study to more advantage. An anxious inquirer, a man who wishes to know what true religion is, could be directed to no portion of the New Testament where he would more readily find the instruction that he needs, than to this portion of the writings of the aged and experienced disciple whom Jesus loved. A true Christian can find nowhere else a more clear statement of the nature of his religion, and of the evidences of real piety, than in this epistle.

## A Suggestion

The portion of Scripture designated for each lesson should be so thoroughly studied that every question can be answered in the exact words of the text. The questions are framed with the purpose to make this possible. It is hoped that the notes will be found suggestive and helpful in the further development of the thought of the lesson. Teachers should encourage a careful study of the ideas presented, and, above all, should seek to make such a practical application of the subject-matter as will be a help in personal experience.
