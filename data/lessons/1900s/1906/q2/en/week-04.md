## Notes

1. Verses 18-19.—Apostasy is a characteristic of the last time (or hour, R. V.). The Saviour predicted this (Matt. 24:11, 12), and the church had been warned of it more than once (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1-5). The incarnation is the testing truth (2 John 7), and this really means the union of Divinity and humanity in the believer (Col. 1:27). This experience involves the death of self (Rom. 6:6), and giving up all things temporal (Luke 14:33), and many fail to endure the test. The power of God in the church is the best agency for relieving it of unworthy members (Isa. 52:1), as is shown in the early church (Acts 5:1-14). Jesus was anointed by the Father (Acts 10:38), and so are His followers (2 Cor. 1:21), and they are thus enabled to comprehend the things of God (Eph. 1:17-19), which are spiritually discerned (1 Cor. 2:12-14).

2. Verses 22-23.—Christ being the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4), one with the Father (John 10:30), through whom alone the Father could be known (Matt. 11:27), to see one was to see the other (John 12:45), and the denial of one includes the rejection of the other (compare 2 Peter 2:1; Jude 4).

3. Verses 24-25.—Love to one another was the command from the beginning (2 John 5) and this involves the new birth (1 John 4:7), which results in the indwelling presence of both the Father and the Son (John 14:23). Christ is the Life (John 11:25), and is from eternity (Micah 5:2, margin), and so is called the eternal life (1 John 1:2), which was promised before man fell (Titus 1:2), and announced to him before he was driven from the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:15). To believe on Christ is to receive Him (John 1:12) who is life (Col. 3:4), and so believers have everlasting life (John 3:36). When God gave Christ to the world, He poured out all the treasure of heaven in one gift (Col. 2:9), and it will be our constant stay to all eternity to learn what we have in Christ.
