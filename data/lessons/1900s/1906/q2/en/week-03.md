## Notes

1. Verses 9-11.—Love for the brethren is an evidence of conversion (1 John 3:14), and no one can be in the light (John 8:12) and not have this love. Christ identifies Himself with His followers, and counts every service rendered to them as if done to Him (Matt. 25:40). There are only two classes. All are either "in the light" or "in darkness." Love is the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22), by which it is shed abroad in the heart (Rom. 5:5). When man sinned, "selfishness took the place of love," but "in the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the principle of action." God loved us when we were sinners (Rom. 5:8), and Christians must not limit this love to their brethren (Matt. 5:44-46). "The Spirit of Christ's self-sacrificing love is the spirit that pervades heaven, and is the very essence of its bliss. This is the spirit that Christ's followers will possess, the work that they will do."

Christians are to love one another (John 15:12, 17), which is the fulfilling of the law (Rom. 13:10). "We should love and respect one another, notwithstanding the faults and imperfections that we can not help seeing." "We are to stand under the shadow of the cross of Calvary, humbling our hearts, confessing our sins, and entreating the Lord to pardon our defects of character, and strengthen our love for the brethren."

It is dangerous to trifle with light, for light rejected will bring darkness (John 12:35), and this is the greatest darkness of all (Matt. 6:23). When minds are blinded by Satan (2 Cor. 4:4), the people are in the deepest darkness (Isa. 60:2), and do not perceive the snares of the devil.

2. Verses 15-17.—Our thoughts are to be above (Col. 3:2) where our citizenship is (Phil. 3:20, R. V.), and our love can not be divided (Matt. 6:24). Enmity between Christians and the world is of long standing (Gen. 3:15), and is really the hope of the race. "It is the grace that Christ implants in the soul which creates in man enmity against Satan." We may be friends of God (John 15:15) as Abraham was (Isa. 41:8), or friend of the world; but we can not be both at the same time (James 4:4). "Conformity to the world will never be the means of converting the world to Christ." The world passes away, but character endures. The will of God is His law (Rom. 2:18), which is everlasting righteousness (Ps. 119:172, 144; Isa. 51:6-8).

"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
