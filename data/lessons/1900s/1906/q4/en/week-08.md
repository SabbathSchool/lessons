## Notes

1. The first object worshiped by those who forsake the true God is self; the next is usually the sun, which is the brightest object visible to men. Then any object, either animate or inanimate, may be selected as an object of worship by the darkened mind.

2. After the wind, the earthquake, and the fire, God spoke to Elijah by a "still, small voice." While the Lord is using windstorms, earthquakes, and great fires to herald His coming, He desires to speak to each of us by "the still, small voice" of His Spirit.
