## Notes

1. "Whenever one is encompassed with clouds, perplexed by circumstances, or afflicted by poverty or distress, Satan is at hand to tempt and annoy. He attacks our weak points of character. He seeks to shake our confidence in God, who suffers such a condition of things to exist. We are tempted to distrust God, to question His love. Often the tempter comes to us as he came to Christ, arraying before us our weakness and infirmities. He hopes to discourage the soul, and to break our hold on God. Then he is sure of his prey. If we would meet him as Jesus did, we should escape many a defeat. By parleying with the enemy, we give him an advantage."—Desire of Ages, pages 120, 121.

2. The Word of God is not simply so many leaves, chapters and verses. It is a thing of life. If all copies of the Scriptures in existence were burned, the Word of God would still stand fast. Heb. 4:12, R. V.; 1 Peter 1:23.

3. "By coming to dwell with us, Jesus was to reveal God both to men and to angels. He was the word of God,—God's thought made audible."—Desire of Ages, page 17.
