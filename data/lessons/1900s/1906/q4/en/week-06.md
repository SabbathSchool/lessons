## Notes

1. "God informed Satan that to His Son alone He would reveal His secret purposes, and He required all the family in heaven, even Satan, to yield Him implicit, unquestioned obedience; but that he (Satan) had proved himself unworthy a place in heaven. Then Satan exultingly pointed to his sympathizers, comprising nearly one-half of all the angels, and exclaimed, These are with me! Will you expel these also, and make such a void in heaven? He then declared that he was prepared to resist the authority of Christ, and to defend his place in heaven by force of might, strength against strength."—Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 1, page 22.

2. "It is through Christ, by the ministration of His heavenly messengers, that every blessing comes from God to us."—Desire of Ages, page 143.

3. The prophet likens the people of God to a maiden, laughing, and shaking her head at this fierce foe. Think of this strong army outside of Jerusalem, and "the virgin daughter of Zion" laughing and shaking her head at the heathen king's legions. Certainly she must have had confidence in divine protection.

4. When an earthly government sends an ambassador to another country, in such a representative is vested all the power of the nation in whose service he is. So when God commissions a heavenly ambassador to represent the government of the Universe, all of the power of the kingdom of heaven is vested in the messenger sent for the accomplishment of God's purpose.
