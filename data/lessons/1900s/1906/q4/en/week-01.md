## Notes

Salvation means to save from sin, and from all of its woeful results, of which the "second death" is the ultimate. It is, therefore, a message of life, instead of death, a message of fullness of joy, instead of unutterable woe. This is, in brief, the "Great Salvation." The whole scheme is beyond our comprehension, yet we can joyfully and thankfully avail ourselves of all of its benefits.
