# The Gospel Story Three Times Told

While the special purpose of these readers is to put the child in possession of a complete key to English reading, they also familiarize him with the most important Bible truths. Three times over they tell of God's plan for the earth in the beginning, the successive steps in the work of Creation, something about each of these steps, a sketch of certain selected Bible child biographies including the life of Jesus, His work and suffering, the plan of salvation finished, and the new earth.

## The First Time:
In simple language, by attractive pictures, and the best methods of teaching reading, True Education Reader No. 1 fixes upon the child's mind in his first school year an outline of the beautiful Gospel story from Creation to Redemption.

## The Second Time:
Enriched by many illustrations, enlarged by additional topics, made more interesting by sketches from the lives of insects, birds, and animals, the incidents in the Gospel story are given the second time in True Education Reader No. 2.

## The Third Time:
True Education Reader No. 3 tells it again, and in connection with it brings in a variety of other matter such as poems, biographical sketches, Bible selections, our Saviour's parables, simple lessons on physiology, geography, and botany, and adapts it all to the growing intelligence of the child in his third school year for whose use it is intended.

## How the Mind Is Prepared for This Thrice-told Story:
The oral Bible Lessons which follow the same outline as the readers are given by the teacher or parent before (perhaps one or two weeks) the child comes to the subject in his reading, so when he does come to the lesson in his reading, he recognizes it and reads with greater interest and understanding.

## And Then the Story Is Reviewed:
The regular text-book for Bible study which is now being prepared for grades or school years four, five, and six, is developed from this same outline. Hence the child's fourth, fifth, and sixth year's work in Bible will be in the nature of a review of the lessons, the general features of which he has been made familiar with during the preceding three years.

## An Illustration:
Suppose a child with his parents takes a trip across the continent. Before he reaches each point of special interest, he is told a story concerning it by his parents. When the point is reached he has developed an interest in it, and is likely to remember something about it.

The next year the trip is taken again. The same method is followed by the parents. More points are visited, and much more is learned about those seen the first time.

The succeeding year he takes the same journey, but with various side trips, and spends more time at each point. Old memories are revived and strengthened, new facts concerning familiar places are learned, and all is vividly impressed upon his mind by the thrice-told story to which he has listened and the threefold view he has enjoyed.

## The Application:
This is the kind of a trip and the method of instruction enjoyed by the child who learns to read by use of the True Education Reader Series, books One, Two, and Three.

## The Harmony of This Plan:
So you see the True Education Reader Series harmonizes with the plans and methods adopted by the Educational Department of the General Conference in behalf of our church schools.

## Description and Prices:
These books are each durably bound in cloth, and will be sent post-paid at the following prices:

| Book | Pages | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| No. 1 | 204 | $0.75 |
| No. 2 | 256 | $0.75 |
| No. 3 | 304 | $0.90 |

A 32-page circular containing sample pages from these books will be sent free on request. Address your state tract society.

## This is the list of Bible Lessons or talks outlined by the General Conference Educational Department to be presented during each of the first three school years.

The reading lessons in True Education Reader Series Nos. One, Two, and Three run parallel to these talks—each book covering the entire course.

These readers contain the memory verse designed to accompany each talk; also the story upon which the talk itself is based.

With these readers the parent or teacher will find the task of interesting the child in Bible stories and of teaching him to read an easy one.
