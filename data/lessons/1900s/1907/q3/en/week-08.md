## Notes

1. In Gal. 4:22-28 Paul gives three illustrations of the covenant of bondage; namely, Hagar and Ishmael, Mount Sinai and the Israelites, and the Jerusalem of Paul's day with its people.

2. From the illustrations here given we learn:
   (a) That this covenant is after the flesh.
   (b) That it is a substitution of man's works for God's works, or man trying to help God fulfill His promise.
   (c) That it is an effort on the part of man to provide for his own salvation.

3. In all the murmuring of the children of Israel there was a spirit of criticism of God's dealings with them. A murmur always suggests the idea that the complaining one could suggest an improvement. "I could do better than that myself" is the under-current of all complaining. So when they reached Mount Sinai God endeavored to teach them their weakness by giving them a chance to show just what they could do.

4. The promised results are the same in both covenants, but the compliance on the part of the people in the first covenant rested upon the promise of the people. "All that the Lord hath said, we will do and be obedient," was the promise. Man's promise was not good. But in the second the compliance rests upon the promises of God. "I will write the law in your hearts. I will take away the heart of stone and give a heart of flesh. I will give you My Spirit. I will cause you to walk in My statutes. I will remember your sins no more." These are the better promises upon which the second is established, and they are all good, for they are the promises of God. All we have to do is to accept them and we find them to be yea and amen in Christ Jesus. Notice, also, that the second has the advantage of the promise of the forgiveness of sin, which does not appear in the first at all.

5. From these illustrations we learn:
   (a) That the old covenant is simply man's effort to keep God's commandments, and
   (b) That man's promises are of no avail and only deepen the bondage of sin.
