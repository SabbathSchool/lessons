## Notes

1. That day the sentence of death passed upon Adam, and he did lose eternal life. God permitted him to retain a physical life, which he had completely forfeited until the plan of salvation could be submitted to him, and he avail himself of its provisions if he would choose to do so. So every sinner has forfeited the life he has, and is dead in trespasses and sins; but God gives time to repent and accept the salvation He has provided.

2. God says He will give Christ for the covenant of the people, that is, Christ would furnish the people's part of the covenant. God requires of the people perfect righteousness, but all have failed, so Jesus came to stand in our stead and furnish what we have failed to furnish, and thus to renew the broken covenant in Himself and with the people in Him.

3. If Adam had been faithful to God, the earth with all its Edenic beauty would have been established in him. Isa. 49:8, and on, shows that Christ, by performing the people's part of the covenant, will bring back the condition which always accompanies perfect righteousness, and thus in the second Adam the renewed earth will be established by the renewal of the covenant. The covenant thus renewed is called the new covenant. New in the Bible often means renewed, as new heaven, new earth, new moon, new heart, etc.
