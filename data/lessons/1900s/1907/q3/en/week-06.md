## Notes

1. The letter of any covenant is that which defines the terms of the covenant. The letter of a covenant for the building of a house is the plans and specifications of the house, together with the reward or penalty for the compliance or failure. The letter sets forth that which the contracting parties are to perform. To one who has failed to comply, the letter points out that failure and can only bring condemnation, and under God's covenant, death. Hence the letter ministers only death to the sinner.

2. The object of the law is life; but life can only result from perfect obedience to it. Prov. 12:28. Hence the law describes a perfect righteousness. But we have all sinned, so that the law which was ordained to life, we find to be unto death. A perfect law can only condemn imperfection.

3. Christ was baptized with God's Spirit (Matt. 3:16), by whose power He kept for us God's law while here with us in human sinful flesh. And it is through His obedience we are enabled by God's Holy Spirit to also keep the same law that Jesus kept. Then this same law which before ministered death, becomes the law of lifeâ€”"the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." Rom. 8:2.
