## Note

The bondage is sin or transgression of the law. Christ alone can save the sinner, and make him righteous or obedient. When a man assumes by his own works to make himself righteous, he is taking upon himself an obligation that he can never bear. The more one seeks to justify himself by his own acts, the more he becomes entangled in the yoke of bondage, or sin. Any theory or system which seeks righteousness by works is but a yoke of bondage.
