## Notes

1. By these texts it will be clearly seen that Christ, in counsel with the Father, offered Himself as a substitute for man, that God accepted this offer, and thus the new, or renewed, covenant was confirmed of God in Christ by promise; Christ bringing to man the righteousness man failed to furnish, and meeting the penalty which man had incurred by sin.

2. By these texts we see that the new, or renewed, covenant was confirmed between God and Abraham in Christ, by promise on God's part, and by faith on Abraham's part. In exactly this way it was, and is, confirmed with every sinner, whether before or since the cross.
