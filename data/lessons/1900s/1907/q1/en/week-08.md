## Note

The first of the commandment was given in the first year of Cyrus. Cyrus reigned seven years; his son Cambyses, seven and one-half years; Smerdis the Impostor, half a year; Darius Hystaspes, thirty-six years; Xerxes, twenty years; and the last of the decree was given in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, making seventy-nine years. It took seventy-nine years for man to carry out the command of God; but there came a time when God could wait no longer. It might have come before; but it could be delayed no longer.
