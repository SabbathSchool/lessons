## Notes

1. The Samaritans did not love nor fear the Lord; they wished to help build because they thought if Jerusalem was rebuilt it would be a wise policy for them to have a part in it. Such helpers hinder the Lord, and Zerubbabel showed great spiritual discernment in refusing them. 2 Kings 17:24-34 gives the origin of the Samaritans.

2. From the Bible record we have the names of Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes, kings reigning between the time of Cyrus and Darius the Persian. According to profane history Cambyses, and Smerdis the Impostor reigned during this time, hence it has been thought probable that these names refer to the same kings.
