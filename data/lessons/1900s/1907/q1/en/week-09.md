2. The decree of Darius was a repetition of the one issued by Cyrus and embraced the rebuilding of the temple and the establishment of the worship.

3. By referring to the list of Persian kings given in Note 1, under Lesson VIII, it will be seen that seventeen years intervened between the first year of Cyrus and the second year of Darius the Persian.

4. Artaxerxes made provision for the establishment of the government. This was not mentioned by either Cyrus or Darius.

5. From the second year of Darius the Persian to the seventh year of Artaxerxes was sixty-two years. This, with the seventeen years between the decrees of Cyrus and Darius, makes seventy-nine years covered by the full decree.

6. Before the captivity, Jerusalem had a government as well as a temple and worship, and a decree to restore and to build Jerusalem must include the re-establishment of the government as well as the worship; therefore, the command could not be said to have gone forth until provision was made for the establishing of the government. This was in 457 B.C., in the decree of Artaxerxes.

The following taken from an editorial in the Review and Herald of April 5, 1906, contains important historical data on this question, and should be carefully studied:

According to the generally accepted chronology, the seventh of Artaxerxes was B.C. 457, as is noted in the margin of the Authorized Version of the book of Ezra; but, as is the case with almost every important doctrine, some have disputed this date, and have asserted that there was not sufficient proof to establish this important position. We have therefore thought it might be worth the while to bring forward some historical evidence bearing upon this question, evidence of such a character that it can not be set aside by mere assertion.

As the extract which we shall quote involves some abbreviations and expressions not now in common use in reckoning time, we will interpret some of them, so that all our readers may have as clear an understanding as possible of the grounds upon which the reckoning is based. The expression "An. 1, Olymp. 87" means "in the first year of the eighty-seventh Olympiad," and the expression "An. 4, Olymp. 88" means "in the fourth year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad," and the expression "An. 1, Olymp. 75" means "in the first year of the seventy-fifth Olympiad," and the expression "An. 4, Olymp. 83" means "in the fourth year of the eighty-third Olympiad." The Olympiad was "the period of four years between any two celebrations of the Olympic games," at Olympia in Elis, one of the States of Greece, the first Olympiad being reckoned from B.C. 776. Whenever the abbreviation "An. J. P." occurs, it may be interpreted, "The year of the Julian Period." This was "a chronological period of 7,980 years, combining the solar, lunar, and indiction cycles," which was given a theoretical starting-point in B.C. 4713. "The Julian Period was proposed by Scaliger, to remove or avoid ambiguities in chronological dates, and was so named because composed of Julian years." The abbreviation "lib." should be read "book." The expression "Anno Urbis Conditae 273" may be read "in the two hundred and seventy-third year from the founding of the city," referring to the founding of Rome in B.C. 754. The other abbreviations will doubtless be understood by the average reader.

The quotation to which reference has been made is from Part I, Chap. 10, of Sir Isaac Newton's work on the prophecies of Daniel, and reads as follows:

The grounds of the chronology here followed [to show that the seventh year of Artaxerxes was B.C. 457] I will now set down as briefly as I can.

7. The data is too extensive to include in full. Readers can find the complete article in the Review and Herald of April 5, 1906.
