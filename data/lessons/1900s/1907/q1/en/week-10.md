## Notes

1. The seven weeks and sixty-two weeks begin with the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, and close with "Messiah the Prince." John 1:41 (margin), Acts 10:38 with Luke 3:21, 22 show that Jesus became the Messiah or the "Anointed One" when He was anointed with the Holy Ghost at His baptism. Therefore the sixty-nine weeks reach from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem to the baptism of Jesus.

2. Seven weeks would contain seven times seven years, or forty-nine years, and sixty-two weeks would contain seven times sixty-two, or 434 years. Forty-nine years plus 434 years equal 483 years.

3. Four hundred and eighty-three years minus 457½ years leaves 26½ years A.D., or 27 A.D., the date of the baptism of Christ.

4. Seventy weeks or 490 years were determined upon the Jews. The sixty-nine weeks ended in 27 A.D. Seven years, or one week, added to this brings us to 34 A.D. the end of the seventy weeks.

5. The seventy weeks, or 490 years, taken from the 2,300 years leaves 1,810 years yet remaining at the end of the seventy weeks. The seventy weeks, or 490 years, ended 34 A.D. The 2,300 years ended 1,810 years later, or in 1844.
