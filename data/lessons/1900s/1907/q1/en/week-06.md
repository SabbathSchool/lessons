## Notes

1. The Jews were building in direct opposition to a royal command not to build. Ezra 4:23, 24. This required much faith.

2. Darius the Persian was known in history as Darius Hystaspes. He came to the throne after Smerdis the Impostor.

3. Their power lay in recognizing God alone as their Master. The work of the Lord will always go forward with power when the workers know of a surety in their hearts that they are "servants of the God of heaven," and not men-servers, and souls are of more value to them than wages. Then they can carry forward the work rapidly and it will prosper in the face of opposition and discouraging circumstances.

4. The foundation of the temple was laid in the second year of Cyrus. Cyrus reigned five years after the work began. Cambyses reigned seven and one-half years, Smerdis six months, and this was the second year of Darius (Ezra 4:14), making fifteen years since they had commenced building the temple.

5. The letter of Tatnai was a fair, open, honorable letter, stating the facts in their true light; while the letter of the Samaritans was just the opposite. History repeats itself. The Samaritans "feared the Lord and served their graven images." 2 Kings 17:41. The cause of God will often receive better treatment today from worldly people, than from half converted, professed Christians.
