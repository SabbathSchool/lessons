## Notes

1. **"Every one," "each one."** Both expressions are used. There is not one soldier in Christ's army, not one child in His family, not one member in His body, who is to be an idler. Each and every one has a work to do for the Master which will use every power of his being. He needs that work for the formation of character; he owes that work to Him who released him from bondage; he must share in it as a privilege if he is to be a partaker in the eternal joy. The great need of the world demands the consecration to God's service now.

2. (a) **"For the perfecting of the saints,"** the development of character. The gifts are God's tools by which His people are brought to a state of perfection. (b) **"For the work of the ministry,"** not necessarily preaching, but including it. Preaching is only one form of ministry. Every child of God ought to be a minister, a servant of His, and every work done for God is a work of ministry or service. The measure of our loving service is the measure of our greatness before God. (c) **"The edifying of the body of Christ."** No true gift in its exercise tears down, but builds up. That is the purpose of God through His children, to build each other up. But this can be done only in God's way, by God's means, His word, His Spirit, His service.

3. A gift, not "the gift," as in our Common Version. Every soul has received at least a gift, one gift, and as he has so received, let him use it in blessing others.

4. **"To him that hath shall be given."** That is, to him who holds his gift for God, who uses it for God, shall be given other gifts. The use of the one gift makes that gift more effective. To the faithful steward of one gift, if he has ability, God will add other gifts.

5. It is not for man to choose his gift or gifts. God divides these gifts of the Spirit, not as we will, but as He wills. He tells us to covet earnestly the best gifts, but that ought ever to be the best gifts for us, which He chooses - those which we can use the best. An inordinate desire for some gift greatly esteemed throws man on Satan's ground, and leaves him open to the deceptions of the enemy.
