## Notes

1. **"In the Image of God"** - Not merely a physical image, but a moral image - a being capable of being developed in character like unto his Maker. God had wrought everything in creation that He could do. All that was lacking was a developed character; but as this could be formed only by choice, man alone became responsible. He could refuse God's ways and die; he could choose God's ways and live.

2. The original word translated "upright" is "Israel." God created man to be Israel. Connect this thought with the gates of the New Jerusalem, into which all the redeemed enter. These gates are named after the twelve tribes of Israel.

3. The curse rested most heavily upon him who brought it; but as the prince of the earth, under God, yielded to sin, he brought the curse upon everything in his dominion. "For the creation was subjected to vanity [uselessness, transientness, death], not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it." Rom. 8:20.
