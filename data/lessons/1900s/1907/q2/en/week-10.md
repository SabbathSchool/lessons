## Notes

1. When we have the same person, at the same time, making certain gifts, to the same ones, for the same purpose, the gifts must be identical, though called by different names. The pounds, the talents, the spiritual gifts, are identical. God likens them to the highest denominations of money to show how highly they should be regarded. The pound was the highest division in Roman money, the talent the highest in Hebrew money.

2. All the spiritual gifts may not be named in these Scriptures. God gives as we need. Note that sometimes the gift is connected with the persons, as in apostles, and prophets, and evangelists, and sometimes referred to in the gift alone, as prophecy, the word of wisdom, etc.

3. The church is likened to the body; the various gifts to the different members. As in the perfect, healthy, normal body, no part is lacking, and each and every part has its proper functions to perform, so God's church, when complete, will have within it every gift; all its members will be fitted for service.
