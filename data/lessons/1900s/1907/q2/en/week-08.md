## Notes

1. **"Into,"** not "in," as in the Common Version. Not the mere mention of a name, but into the name, swallowed up in the name, whelmed by, immersed in, all that it stands for.

2. **"Name,"** character. God's name reveals His goodness. Ex. 33:18, 19; 34:6, 7. When Jacob gained the victory, God changed his name to Israel to correspond with his change of character. Gen. 32:24-28. Name as used in Matt. 28:19 stands for character. See also Matt. 1:21.

3. The name of the Father stands for goodness and righteousness, which He in mercy freely bestows upon us in Christ Jesus. Rom. 3:20-22. Baptized into His name is to give up all our sins, all our righteousnesses, and receive His alone. Phil. 3:8-10.

4. The name of the Son stands for emptiness of self, self-denial, self-abnegation, and fulness of God's righteous character. The Son of God came not to reveal Himself. He did not reveal Himself when He came to earth. That was not His purpose. John 1:18; 5:19, 30; 14:10. His character, His mind, was to empty Himself, that the Father might fill Him with all the fulness of the Godhead. Phil. 2:5-9; Col. 1:19.

5. **Power** - The active divine agency in effecting all God's will is the Spirit. Over the chaos in the beginning, the Spirit brooded and brought the cosmos of life and beauty. Gen. 1:2. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth." By the Spirit His word is given. 2 Sam. 23:2. "By His Spirit He hath garnished the heavens." Job 26:13. By the Spirit the dead are recreated and the earth renewed. Ps. 104:30. By the Spirit Jesus was begotten (Luke 2:35); by the Spirit His children are begotten (John 3:5); by the Spirit Jesus was filled for service (Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38); and by the Spirit we are given power for service (Acts 1:8); by the Spirit we are given life, and our mortal bodies quickened (Rom. 8:8-10).
