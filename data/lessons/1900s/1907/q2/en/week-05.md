## Notes

1. **"Predestinated," "foreordained," "marked out."** God marked us out in that character to which He called us. That is His plan for us. That is our worth to Him. That is what He will work out in us if we will yield all to Him.

2. **"According to the riches of His grace,"** not our poor conception, not just enough to meet our needs, but grace superabounding over all sin.

3. **"The earnest,"** the pledge, the assurance of God. When one party buys a piece of property of another, he often pays a part down "to bind the bargain." This is "earnest" money, a pledge that all will be paid in due time. Thus God pledges the fulfilment of all His promises, and places in us the life pledge, the earnest of all the glorious, eternal things promised, the Holy Spirit.
