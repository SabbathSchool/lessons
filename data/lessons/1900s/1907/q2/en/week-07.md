## Note

What a precious thought it is that in all our conflicts, all our trials, all the dark, uncomprehended pathways, God has His eye upon us, upon the new name, the shining crown, the eternal inheritance, for which He has called us, and the everlasting new song of joy. Read Rom. 8:28, as in the margin of the Revised Version: "And we know that to them that love God, God worketh all things with them for good."
