## Notes

1. **"Prophesy"** means to foretell; and a prophet is literally one who foretells. But the word hardly covers the office of the prophet, as all the prophecies which have come down to us demonstrate. The prophet spoke for God as Aaron spoke for Moses. Ex. 7:1, 2. He was God's messenger to speak God's message. He reproved, rebuked, warned of present and coming danger, instructed in righteousness and present duty. Foretelling was frequently a small part of his work. It was frequently only practical instruction in righteousness.

2. There is a profound reason why, when God's law ceased to be recognized, or was lost sight of, prophecy ceased, even though good men lived. If the Lord had allowed prophecy to flourish, there could have been no standard of testing. The spirit of prophecy is restored to the church synchronous with the restoration of His law. False prophets also abound, but we have the standard infallible by which to test them, God's law, God's voice.

3. Till "that which is perfect" is come, the church of God will need prophetic guidance. 2 Peter 1:19; 1 Cor. 13:8-10. Even when she becomes Spirit-filled, and without spot or wrinkle, she will not say, We do not need the prophetic word, for then she will prize it most; it will be a part of her very being.

4. **"Desire earnestly the greater gifts,"** "spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy." American Revised Version. The greatness is measured by the service rendered. Matt. 20:26, 27. By prophesying here we understand is meant speaking God's word unto edification. 1 Cor. 14:3.

5. The better way, and the only safe way, to seek any of God's gifts is the way of love, set forth in 1 Corinthians 13. Then, indeed, will the Spirit of God divide to us the gifts we can best use. God bestows His gifts with wisdom and prudence. Eph. 1:8.

6. **"Confirmed"** - It is good to have good news and good things confirmed unto us. See Heb. 2:3. We have the assurance they are true; but they benefit us not if the work goes no farther. The spirit of prophecy has been confirmed unto many. But what God desires, and what we must have, is the testimony of Christ "confirmed in us."

7. The gift of prophecy, if received, becomes the door, the entrance, to all gifts. If we will not accept the gift which warns, reproves, instructs, God can not entrust us with other gifts. Until we prize pure, true character more than display of supernatural power, God can not bestow the power. Power displayed without the fruits of the Spirit must come from some other source. As we accept the testimony of Jesus, other gifts will follow, and the church will stand complete, coming "behind in no gift."
