## Notes

1. Dr. Adam Clarke says, in his comments on Gen. 2:2, "It is worthy of notice that the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Samaritan, read the sixth day instead of the seventh; and this should be considered the genuine reading, which appears from these versions to have been originally that of the Hebrew text."

2. "The blessing and sanctification of the seventh day were because that God had rested upon it. His resting upon it, then, was to lay the foundation for blessing and sanctifying the day."—"Andrew's History of the Sabbath," page 15.

3. The Sabbath commandment is very definite. It relates to a definite day and gives the reasons why this particular day should be observed. The day to be kept holy is the seventh day which God made holy by resting upon it and placing His blessing upon that day.

4. The Sabbath was designed that man might have a perpetual, weekly reminder of the power of God to create the world, and therefore His power and ability to sanctify and save the believer. The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification which the Lord has given to His people.

5. The heritage of Jacob spoken of in this text is a part in the new earth—a share with the redeemed people of God in the eternal kingdom.

6. At the time when Christ was on the earth the Pharisees thought it wrong to heal the afflicted on the Sabbath day. They therefore waited till the setting of the sun, or closing of the Sabbath, before bringing the sick to Jesus to be healed.

The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
