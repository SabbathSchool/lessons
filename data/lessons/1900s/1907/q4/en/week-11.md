## Notes

1. The definite time for Christ's manifestation as the Messiah had been foretold by Daniel the prophet. Dan. 9:24-27. The nations were sitting in darkness, and but few persons understood the prophecies. Yet some in different nations were looking for the Messiah to make His appearance.

2. "As in old time, Cyrus was called to the throne of the world's empire that he might set free the captives of the Lord, so Caesar Augustus is made the agent for the fulfilment of God's purpose in bringing the mother of Jesus to Bethlehem. She is of the lineage of David, and the Son of David must be born in David's city."—"Desire of Ages," page 46, Trade Edition.
