## Notes

1. This horn which plucked up three other horns in order to establish itself, represents Rome in its papal form. Surely no better symbol could have been chosen than this. Eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth which speaks blasphemous things, foreshadow with remarkable accuracy the shrewd, cunning, deceitful work of the man of sin.

2. The exceedingly wicked character of this power is set forth in the most forcible manner. He shall "speak great words against the Most High," and shall wear out His saints. Witness the blasphemous titles, such as "vicegerent of the Son of God," "another God upon earth," and the assumption of papal infallibility, etc. Concerning the persecuting character of this power, note the following:

"No computation can reach the numbers who have been put to death, in different ways, on account of their maintaining the profession of the Gospel, and opposing the corruptions of the Church of Rome. A million of poor Waldenses perished in France; nine hundred thousand orthodox Christians were slain in less than thirty years after the institution of the order of the Jesuits. The Duke of Alva boasted of having put to death in the Netherlands thirty-six thousand by the hand of the common executioner during the space of a few years. The Inquisition destroyed, by various tortures, one hundred and fifty thousand within thirty years. These are a few specimens, and but a few, of those which history has recorded. But the total amount will never be known till the earth shall disclose her blood, and no more cover her slain."—Scott's Church History.

3. One of the commands of God's law is different from what it was originally given, if we accept the precepts as contained in catechisms. We refer to the fourth commandment. In the fourth commandment of God's law as found in Roman Catholic catechisms, nothing is mentioned regarding the keeping of the seventh day, or Saturday; the command found there teaches the keeping of Sunday. Furthermore, many catechisms and other works of the Catholic Church teach directly and distinctly that the church, by her own authority, has changed the day to be kept from the seventh to the first.

Dr. Eck, while disputing with Luther, said: "If, however, the church has had power to change the Sabbath of the Bible into Sunday, and to command Sunday keeping, why should it not have this power concerning other days?...If you turn from the church to the Scriptures alone, then you must keep the Sabbath with the Jews, which has been kept from the beginning of the world."—"Enchiridon," pp. 78, 79. London, 1851.

In a Catholic "Doctrinal Catechism" are found the following questions and answers:—

"Question—Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?

"Answer—Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority."

4. "The earliest recognition of the observance of Sunday as a legal duty is a constitution of Constantine in 321 A.D., enacting that all courts of justice, inhabitants of towns, and workshops were to be at rest on Sunday."—"Encyclopedia Britannica," article "Sunday."

"The first day of the week was declared to be the Lord's day by the Council of Nice, A.D., 325."—"Theological Dictionary" (Methodist), article "Sabbath."

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest."
