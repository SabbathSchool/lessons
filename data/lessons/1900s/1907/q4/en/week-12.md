## Notes

1. Jesus came "to make reconciliation for iniquity." Dan. 9:24. His mission was to save sinners. He became a servant and gave His life to ransom many. Matt. 20:28. By sin man had forfeited life. He took our place, and made Himself an offering for sin. The stroke that belonged on us, He voluntarily took upon Himself.

2. "Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has humanity shrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now the history of the human race comes up before the world's Redeemer. He sees that the transgressors of the law, if left to themselves, must perish. He sees the helplessness of man. He sees the power of sin. The woes and lamentations of a doomed world rise before Him. He beholds its impending fate, and His decision is made. He will save man at any cost to Himself. He accepts His baptism of blood, that through Him perishing millions may gain everlasting life. He has left the courts of heaven, where all is purity, happiness, and glory, to save the one lost sheep, the one world that has fallen by transgression. And He will not turn from His mission. He will become the propitiation of a race that has willed to sin. His prayer now breathes only submission: 'If this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.'"—"Desire of Ages," pages 826, 827.

3. "All heaven was filled with wonder when the prayer of Christ was offered in the midst of His terrible suffering—'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.' Yet there stood men formed in the image of God, joining to crush out the life of His only-begotten Son. What a sight for the heavenly universe!"—"Desire of Ages," page 913.

4. "With amazement angels witnessed the Saviour's despairing agony. The hosts of heaven veiled their faces from the fearful sight. Inanimate nature expressed sympathy with its insulted and dying Author. The sun refused to look upon the awful scene. Its full, bright rays were illuminating the earth at midday, when suddenly it seemed to be blotted out. Complete darkness, like a funeral pall, enveloped the cross. There was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. There was no eclipse or other natural cause for this darkness, which was as deep as midnight, without moon or stars. It was a miraculous testimony given by God that the faith of after-generations might be confirmed."—"Desire of Ages," pages 904, 905.

5. To save the lost, Christ must die without the presence of the Father to comfort Him. In this respect, He died as the lost sinner will die. "He trod the winepress alone." But the Father was not far away. "In that thick darkness God's presence was hidden. He makes darkness His pavilion, and conceals His glory from human eyes. God and His holy angels were beside the cross. The Father was with His Son. Yet His presence was not revealed."—"Desire of Ages," page 905.
