## Note

In Isa. 33:15, speaking of him that will "dwell" and not be consumed amid the everlasting burnings that cleanse the earth from sin and sinners (2 Peter 3:7), the Revised Version reads: "He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of fraud," etc. "To defraud God is the greatest crime of which man can be guilty; and yet this sin is deep and wide-spread. Through the prophet Malachi, God says: 'Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed Me . . . in tithes and offerings."â€”Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, Oct. 13,
