## Notes

1. To compute the unlimited "measure" of the gift of Christ, will be the science of the world to come. Eternity alone can unfold the infinite sacrifice of heaven in the gift of the Son of God.

2. "Many hold that from the nature of Christ it was impossible for Satan's temptations to weaken or overthrow Him; then Christ could not have been placed in Adam's position, to go over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell; He could not have gained the victory that Adam failed to gain. If man has in any sense a more trying conflict to endure than had Christ, then Christ is not able to succor him when tempted. Christ took humanity with all its liabilities. He took the nature of man capable of yielding to temptation, and with the same aid that man may obtain, He withstood the temptations of Satan, and conquered the same as we may conquer. . . . He assumed human nature, being the infirmities and degeneracy of the race. It is not true that humanity has trials to bear which the Son of God has not experienced."—Special Testimony.

   "In the Saviour's expiring cry, 'It is finished,' the death-knell of Satan was rung. The great controversy which had been so long in progress was then decided, and the final eradication of evil was made certain."—Great Controversy, page 503.

3. "But what do we give up, when we give all?—A sin-polluted heart for Jesus to purify, to cleanse by His own blood, and to save by His matchless love. And yet men think it hard to give up all! I am ashamed to hear it spoken of, ashamed to write it."—Steps to Christ, page 55.
