## Notes

1. The tithing system was not given to man for the prime object of the support of the ministry, but above this there are moral obligations growing out of man's relations to Christ as Creator and Redeemer, which involve principles which our first parents disregarded in Eden, and on which the loyalty of all other worlds is being tested the same as the inhabitants of this world.

   Who shall not say "Amen" to the words of the apostle, "Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel"?

2. "The work of God which should be going forward with tenfold its present strength and efficiency is kept back, like a spring season held by the chilling blast of winter, because some of God's professed people are appropriating to themselves the means that should be dedicated to His service."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, Oct. 13, 1896. It is not only laborers that are kept out of the ministry because of this sin, but the church itself is paralyzed by her selfish indifference to the claims of Christ.

3. "I saw that if any held on to their property, and did not inquire duty of the Lord, He would not make duty known, and they would be permitted to keep their property, and in the time of trouble it would come up before them like a mountain to crush them, and they would try to dispose of it, but would not be able. I heard some mourn like this: 'The cause was languishing, God's people were starving for the truth; and we made no effort to supply the lack; now our property is useless. O, that we had let it go, and laid up treasure in heaven.' I saw that a sacrifice did not increase, but it decreased, and was consumed. I also saw that God had not required all of His people to dispose of their property at the same time, but if they desired to be taught, He would teach them, in a time of need, when to sell, and how much to sell. Some have been required to dispose of their property in times past to sustain the Advent cause, while others have been permitted to keep theirs until a time of need, then, as the cause needs it, their duty is to sell."—Early Writings, page 48.
