## Notes

1. The spirit of heaven is to give. All that man is, hopes to be, or may possess of life and happiness, is a gift from God. It is Godlike to give; for it is of love, for love gives and gives. Therefore, true worship loves and gives. This is seen in Noah and family as they came forth from the ark, their hearts swelling with gratitude that they could set their feet on earth again. It was not enough that this righteous man should lift his voice in thanksgiving for his deliverance, for past mercies and blessings, but he must there give more tangible evidence of his gratitude than words could express. He must make a burnt offering of a seventh part of the clean animals unto the Lord, as it is written: "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar, and the Lord smelled a sweet savor." Gen. 8:20, 21.

2. The Sabbath offerings connected with the sanctuary service were twice as much as on other days. There are about sixty thousand Seventh-day Adventists in North America. If each of these brought to the Lord a weekly Sabbath offering as the Lord had prospered, we would have at least:

   | Contributors | Weekly Amount | Yearly Amount |
   |-------------|---------------|---------------|
   | 1,000 giving | $2.00 each Sabbath | $104,000 |
   | 1,000 " | 1.00 " " | 52,000 |
   | 1,000 " | .50 " " | 26,000 |
   | 2,000 " | .25 " " | 26,000 |
   | 20,000 " | .10 " " | 104,000 |
   | 20,000 " | .05 " " | 52,000 |
   | 15,000 " | .02 " " | 15,600 |
   | Or a total for the year of | | $379,600 |

   None would be the poorer for this offering, nor would this affect their tithe.

3. "I saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares especially for those who were looking for Christ's second appearing, and keeping all the commandments of God. Satan told his angels: . . . 'Go, make the possessors of lands and money drunk with cares. . . . They may profess what they please, only make them care more for money than for the success of Christ's kingdom or the spread of the truths we hate. Present the world before them in the most attractive light, that they may love and idolize it. We must keep in our ranks all the means of which we can gain control. The more means the followers of Christ devote to His service, the more will they injure our kingdom by getting our subjects. As they appoint meetings in different places, we are in danger. Be very diligent then. Cause disturbance and confusion if possible. Destroy love for one another. Discourage and dishearten their ministers; for we hate them. Present every plausible excuse to those who have means, lest they hand it out. Control the money matters if you can, and drive their ministers to want and distress. This will weaken their courage and zeal. Battle every inch of the ground. Make covetousness and love of earthly treasures the ruling traits of their character. As long as these traits rule, salvation and grace stand back. Crowd every attraction around them, and they will be surely ours. And not only are we sure of them, but their hateful influence will not be exercised to lead others to heaven. When they shall attempt to give, put within them a grudging disposition, that it may be sparingly.'"—Early Writings, pages 128, 129.

4. "Upon what principle can it be said that we rob God in 'offerings,' if God has given to man nine-tenths of his income, and has only reserved the tithe as holy to Himself?" God has not specified any particular amount that man should give in offerings; yet if we do not recognize the obligation we are under to God for what He has done, and is doing for us in the gift of Jesus Christ, we show the basest ingratitude. When our friends have bestowed upon us some valuable gift, we look about us to see what we can do to reciprocate the favor. The greater the gift bestowed, the greater the sense of obligation and gratitude. If the trifling favors bestowed upon man by their fellows can call forth a return of "gifts" according to the receiver's ability, how much more should the "gift" of life and redemption call forth from man constant recognition of his obligations and gratitude to his Redeemer?

5. "Every blessing bestowed upon us calls for a response to the Author of all our mercies. The Christian should often review his past life, and recall with gratitude the precious deliverances that God has wrought for him, supporting him in trial, opening ways before him when all seemed dark and forbidding, refreshing him when ready to faint. He should recognize all of them as evidences of the watchcare of heavenly angels. In view of these innumerable blessings, he should often ask, with subdued and grateful heart, 'What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?' Our time, our talents, our property, should be sacredly devoted to Him who has given us these blessings in trust. Whenever a special deliverance is wrought in our behalf, or new and unexpected favors are granted us, we should acknowledge God's goodness, not only by expressing our gratitude in words, but, like Jacob, by gifts and offerings to His cause. As we are continually receiving the blessings of God, so we are to be continually giving."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 187, 188.
