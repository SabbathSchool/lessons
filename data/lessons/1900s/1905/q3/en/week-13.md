## Notes

1. On the day of Pentecost, the disciples were endued with power from on high. This wonderful refreshing and baptism of the Holy Ghost was the "early," or "former rain." A similar outpouring of the Holy Ghost will fall upon the remnant people of God. This is called the "latter rain." This latter refreshing will be as wonderful in power and results as the early rain was on the day of Pentecost. This is the burden of Joel's second chapter. In verse 1, the prophet says: "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand." In verse 12, the Lord pleads, "Turn ye even to Me with all your heart," and in verse 23 He gives the result.

2. The inheritance and the promises are to the obedient. In these days, we may ask in assurance for the gift of the Spirit only as we endeavor to walk in every command and ordinance of God. In Malachi 3:10, the Lord makes faithfulness in rendering His own to Him the test of readiness to receive the fulness of blessing. This is but one obligation, of course, but the waiting church must not be found wanting in any wise, and many will be cheated out of the blessings of the latter rain by neglect to heed God's Word concerning tithes and offerings. It is the divinely appointed means for carrying the last message to the world as the final harvest is ripened. There is a reason for lack of power, and for dearth of means to enter the mission fields:—

   "Upon what ground may we claim the full and rich promises of God? We can claim them only when we have fulfilled the conditions prescribed in His Word. Have you robbed God in tithes and offerings? What treasure have you been laying up in heaven by giving to the Lord His own? Look at the days and weeks and months of the past, and see if your life service has not been one long, complicated robbery of God, because you have failed to remember Him, and have left eternity out of your reckoning.

   "Great objects are accomplished by this system; for if one and all accept it, each is made a vigilant and faithful treasurer for God; and there would be no want of means to carry forward the great work of sounding the last message of warning to the world. The treasury will be full if all adopt this system, and contributors will not be the poorer."—Testimonies for the Church, No. 24, pages 83, 84.
