## Notes

1. God did not purpose to perpetuate sin throughout eternity, therefore when man sinned he was shut away from the tree of life. None of the human family has ever passed this cherubim and flaming sword sent to guard the way to the tree of life, so there is not an immortal sinner on earth.

2. The words from which "soul," "spirit," etc., are translated occur some seventeen hundred times in their different forms in the Bible; but not in a single instance do we find it stated that the soul is immortal, or never-dying. Immortality is an attribute inherent only with God, who dwells in light unapproachable.

3. Note that it is through the Gospel that both life and immortality are brought to light. We are exhorted to lay hold of life. 1 Tim. 6:12. The believer has life now through faith. John 3:36. But the life we receive by faith we retain by faith. If we lose our faith, we lose this life also. The gift of immortality will be bestowed upon the overcomer at the resurrection of the just.

4. The mission of Christ to this earth was to bring life to man, who, by reason of transgression, had been shut away from the tree of life. He offers to become a tree of life to all who will believe. Nothing could more effectually rob the Son of God of His glory than to teach that man possesses by nature an immortal soul, and is capable of an eternal existence independent of faith in a Redeemer. Were this so, the mission of Christ to give life would have been in vain.
