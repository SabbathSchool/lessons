## The Conflict Between Capital and Labor

This new book, by E. T. Russell, treats upon a subject concerning which every one should become intelligent. The various organizations are reaching out and rapidly embracing all classes of people, trades and professions, and sooner or later we must meet the question face to face. Then we must know where to stand and how to stand.

The author candidly considers both sides of this great question, setting forth not only facts and figures, but divinely revealed principles to guide us right. A good book for your friends and neighbors.

Price only 50 cents

## The Vegetarian Cook Book

For those who are looking for a better dietary than can be prepared from the flesh of animals, which is very liable to be contaminated with tuberculosis and various other diseases, we most heartily recommend this book. It contains a large number of thoroughly tested recipes of healthful, hygienic dishes, and is so systematically arranged that any one may be easily referred to.

The book is the product of practical experience and observation gleaned by Mr. E. G. Fulton, as manager of the Vegetarian Cafe, San Francisco.

265 Pages Price, 75 cents

The book contains 324 pages, divided into 42 chapters. It is thoroughly indexed, giving every Scripture text referred to, as well as subjects treated, also a general index referring to paragraphs.
