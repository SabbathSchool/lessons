## Notes

1. This promise is one Jesus has sent back to death-stricken humanity since He ascended to the throne of His Father. How comforting the thought that though Satan may lock our loved one within the portals of his prison-house, the tomb, the key is in the hands of our Redeemer. Jesus went into the stronghold of the enemy and conquered, bringing in triumph from the tomb the key of death, and thus assuring deliverance to every believing captive.

2. The first resurrection is that of the just, the holy and righteous only. None of the wicked dead will have a part in this resurrection. They live in the second resurrection.

3. Eze. 37:1-14 should be studied in connection with this subject. While this scripture perhaps primarily applies to the condition of ancient Israel, it is no doubt also a portrayal of the final resurrection of the righteous.

4. "Caught up to meet the Lord in the air." In life, angels ever attend God's people. Ps. 34:7. When the Lord comes, all the holy angels will come with Him. His voice will pierce the silent tomb and awake to immortality the righteous dead. As they come from their dusty beds, the angels will "gather" them for the garner on high. How glorious indeed will it be to be "caught up" by an angel escort to meet the Life-giver in the air. This is the Christian's hope.

5. "Then Jesus and all the retinue of holy angels, and all the redeemed saints, left the city. The angels surrounded their Commander, and escorted Him on His way, and the train of redeemed saints followed. Then, in terrible, fearful majesty, Jesus called forth the wicked dead; and they came up with the same feeble, sickly bodies that went into the grave. What a spectacle! What a scene! At the first resurrection all came forth in immortal bloom; but at the second the marks of the curse are visible on all."â€”Early Writings, page 151.
