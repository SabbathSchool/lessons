## Notes

1. Many observe the first day of the week as the sabbath to commemorate the resurrection of Christ. There is no scriptural authority for this practice. The divinely-appointed memorial of the resurrection is baptism. Having become dead to sin, the repentant sinner is buried in the watery grave, and raised again to walk in newness of life, thus showing his faith in the One who says, "I am the resurrection and the life."

2. The eunuch doubtless knew nothing concerning baptism, except as Philip revealed it in preaching Christ unto him. From this it is clearly seen that to fully preach Christ is to preach baptism and immediately upon receiving Him into our hearts there will spring up a desire to be buried with Him in baptism.
