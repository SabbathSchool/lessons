## Notes

1. "John's life was without pleasure. It was sorrowful and self-denying. . . . His life was lonely. He did not cling to his father's family, to enjoy their society, but left them in order to fulfil his mission." — Redemption, by Mrs. E. G. White (out of print), page 44.

2. "John was to go forth as Jehovah's messenger, to bring men to the light of God. . . . Such a messenger must be holy. He must be a temple for the indwelling Spirit of God. In order to fulfil his mission, he must have a sound physical constitution, and mental and spiritual strength. Therefore, it would be necessary for him to control the appetites and passions." — Desire of Ages, page 100.

3. "John came in the spirit and power of Elijah to proclaim the first advent of Jesus. He was to represent those who should go forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to herald the day of wrath, and the second advent of Jesus." — Redemption, by Mrs. E. G. White, page 45.

4. "In the time of John the Baptist, greed for riches, and the love of luxury and display, had become widespread. Sensuous pleasures, feasting and drinking, were causing physical disease and degeneracy, benumbing the spiritual perceptions and lessening the sensibility to sin. John was to stand as a reformer. By his abstemious life and plain dress he was to rebuke the excesses of his time. Hence the directions given to the parents of John, — a lesson of temperance by an angel from the throne of heaven." — Desire of Ages, page 100.

5. "It means much to be true to God. He has claims upon all who are engaged in his service. He desires that mind and body be preserved in the best condition of health, every power and endowment under the divine control, and as vigorous as careful, strictly temperate habits can make him. . . . Only those who appreciate these principles, and have been trained to care for their bodies intelligently and in the fear of God, should be chosen to take responsibilities in this work." — Testimonies, Vol. VI, page 375.

6. "Through observing our lives, the people of the world form their opinion of God and the religion of Christ. All who do not know Christ need to have the high, noble principles of His character kept constantly before them in the lives of those who know Him." — Testimony for the Church, Vol. VI, page 258.

"Christ is to live in His human agents, and work through their faculties, and act through their capabilities." — Mount of Blessing, page 138.

7. "If man will cherish the light that God in mercy gives him upon health reform, he may be sanctified through the truth, and fitted for immortality." — Testimonies for the Church, Vol. III, page 162.
