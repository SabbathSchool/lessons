4. "It is possible to eat immoderately, even of wholesome food. . . . Masticate slowly and allow the saliva to mingle with the food." — Christian Temperance, pages 51, 52.

5. "Many make a mistake in drinking cold water with their meals. Food should not be washed down. . . .

"You should cultivate a love for neatness and strict cleanliness. God is a God of order. He will not sanction slack and disorderly habits in any of His people. In your dress, in your house, in all things, manifest taste and order." — Testimonies, Vol. II, page 66.

7. "In order to be fitted for translation, the people of God must know themselves.

"It is best for those who claim to be sons and daughters of God to avail themselves, while they can, of the opportunities now presented to gain a knowledge of the human system, and how it may be preserved in health. . . . The Lord will not work a miracle to preserve any one in health who will not make an effort to obtain knowledge within his reach concerning this wonderful habitation that God has given." — Mrs. E. G. White, in Medical Missionary, Vol. II, page 216.
