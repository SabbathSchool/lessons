### Notes

1. Cyrus had long before made full provision for every Jew to return to Jerusalem. Ezra 1:1-11. Only 50,000 returned at this time. They had wealth and ease in Babylon, and they chose to remain there, rather than face difficulties in rebuilding the work of the Lord.

2. "The love of Christ does not seem to constrain those who profess His name for a death-like slumber is upon the human agents, and the work is hindered by failure of the human to co-operate with the divine. . . . Consider how your lack of faith, of spirituality, of divine power, is hindering the coming of the kingdom of God."—E. G. White, in Bible Students' Library No. 146.

3. "Day and night they cry unto God for deliverance. . . . Like Jacob, all are wrestling with God. Their countenances express their internal struggle. Paleness sits upon every face, yet they cease not their earnest intercession."—Great Controversy, page 620.

4. "It is at midnight that God manifests His power for the deliverance of His people."—Great Controversy, page 636.

5. Only those who have been diligent students of the Scriptures, and have realized the love of the truth, will be shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world captive."—Great Controversy, page 625.

6. One word from the Saviour would have sent them bounding on their way, rejoicing, but they needed an understanding of the Scriptures in order to meet the trials before them, or else as soon as the Saviour was out of their sight they would have been in doubt and gloom again.

"We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field."
