### Notes

1. "In every quarter, companies of armed men, urged on by hosts of evil angels, are preparing for the work of death."—Great Controversy, Chap. 40, paragraph 2.

2. "I saw the saints leaving the cities and villages, and associating together in companies, and living in the most solitary places. . . . I saw a writing, copies of which were scattered in different parts of the land, giving orders that unless the saints should yield their peculiar faith, give up the Sabbath, and observe the first day of the week, the people were at liberty, after a certain day, to put them to death."—Early Writings, Time of Trouble, page 143.

3. "As the saints left the cities and villages, they were pursued by the wicked, who sought to slay them. But the swords that were raised to kill God's people broke and fell as powerless as a straw. Angels of God shielded the saints."—Early Writings, page 145.

4. "It is at midnight that God manifests His power for the deliverance of His people. . . . The voice of God is heard from heaven declaring the day and hour of Jesus' coming and delivering the everlasting covenant to His people." Isa. 30:27-30; Great Controversy, pages 636, 640.

5. "Their faces, so lately pale, anxious, and haggard, are now aglow with wonder, faith, and love."—Great Controversy page 639.

6. When God's voice declares the hour of Jesus' coming, and turns the captivity of His people, it will be too late for any to repent, but the wicked will acknowledge that God is just, and His people righteous. When the decree of Mordecai turned the captivity of the Jews, there was an opportunity for repentance, and many became Jews. But before God's final deliverance of His people, the destiny of every soul will have been fixed. Rev. 22:11.

"The needs of the cause of God are world-wide."
