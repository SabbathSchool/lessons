### Notes

1. Anciently, in oriental countries, the people reclined upon couches while dining.

2. Faces of criminals are covered, and the servants in covering Haman's face, pronounced his doom. He had covered his own head in shame in the morning. Esther 6:12.

3. It is possible that Harbonah was the same chamberlain that had been sent to Haman's house to call him to the banquet, and the great gallows, 75 feet high must have attracted his attention, and caused him to inquire why it had been built. Hence his suggestion to hang Haman thereon.
