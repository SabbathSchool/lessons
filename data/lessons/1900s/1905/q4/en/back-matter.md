# An Open Letter

Dear Fellow-workers:

At the last General Conference, careful attention was given to the continuation of the missionary campaign entered upon last year. As a result, the following recommendations were unanimously adopted:—

## Missionary Campaign

"Realizing that multitudes are 'in the valley of decision,' and that the time has fully come when the Master pleads with every child of His to 'go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city,' and 'into the highways and hedges,' to bid the hungry and perishing to the marriage feast,—

"63. We recommend, That the great missionary campaign entered upon last year be strengthened, deepened, and enlarged into a mighty movement for the promulgation of the Third Angel's Message.

"To avoid confusion, and to economize effort, we recommend the following:—

## General Plan for North America

"1. That the effort to place the Review and Herald in every Sabbath-keeping home be continued, especially through the camp-meeting season and early fall.

"2. That a general campaign in North America for our missionary periodicals be entered upon October 1.

"3. That beginning in early November special efforts be made by conference workers and church officers to interest our people in the sale of our forty per cent books.

"4. That the interest aroused by this work be developed by—
   "(a) The liberal use of our message-filled tracts.
   "(b) Securing subscriptions for our periodicals.
   "(c) Holding Bible-readings and cottage meetings.
   "(d) Missionary correspondence.

"5. That missionary conventions be held October 7 and November 18 in all our churches to study local needs and to organize for service.

## Supplies

"64. We approve of the plan to publish four special numbers of the Signs of the Times and the Watchman, two special issues of Life and Health, and such issues of the foreign papers as their publishers may deem best.

"65. We look with favor upon the plan of setting aside certain small, easy-selling books for the use of those who wish to canvass in their own neighborhoods.

"66. We also approve of the steps being taken in the publication of the 'Signs of the Times Leaflets,' to furnish our ministers and people with inexpensive literature for general circulation.

## Organization

"67. We recommend, That the General Conference Committee appoint a missionary campaign committee to co-operate with conference officers in carrying out these recommendations.

# Missionary Supplies

That you may have detailed information as to prices and where to secure the various missionary supplies, the Missionary Campaign Committee, appointed by the General Conference, takes this opportunity of writing you.

3. Special Gospel Message Series of Signs of the Times.—The following statement concerning this series from the editor will be of interest right here:—

## Our Forthcoming Specials

The Signs of the Times is set for the purpose of giving the last gospel message of Revelation 14 to the world. And it gives it week by week, number by number. Yet that message is so broad, so comprehensive, that it is impossible to scarcely more than touch it in one issue. In fact it takes an entire volume of the paper to develop that great message at all adequately.

Yet there are many who wish it presented in its various phases briefly. To do this, we propose to issue, beginning with the first week in October, four "Special Message" numbers, as follows:

1. The Sure Word of Prophecy and Christ's Coming.
2. The Sanctuary, The Gospel in Type and Antitype.
3. The Law, the Gospel, and the Sabbath,—"The Whole Duty of Man."
4. The Church Triumphant.

The above titles express only a part of that which each number will contain. Here is a suggestive list of the main articles so far as developed:—

Besides these our Home department will be full of precious instruction. There will be Bible-readings, poems, music, if there is room, many illustrations. Each number will have a specially-prepared front-page cover design, attractive and appropriate to that issue.

This series ought to have a circulation, at the least calculation, of half a million.

These special numbers will bear the following dates: October 4 and 18; November 1 and 15. Prices will be as follows:—

| Quantity | Price |
|----------|-------|
| 1 to 4 sets to one or more addresses | 20 cents a set |
| 5 or more sets to single names and addresses | 15 cents a set |
| 25 to 500 sets to one address | 10 cents a set |
| 500 and upward to one address | 9 cents a set |

These papers will be published somewhat in advance of their dates, and will be sold in sets only. Address your tract society or Signs of the Times, Mountain View, California.

4. Special Series of Watchman.—We have not been informed as yet just what subject the special numbers of the Watchman will treat upon, but we are sure they will be filled with important matter for this time. Prices will be the same as the Gospel Series of the Signs. Address your tract society or the Southern Publishing Association, 1025 Jefferson St., Nashville, Tenn.

5. Life and Health.—Neither have we learned definitely as to the plans of the editors of Life and Health; but those who have been reading this excellent health magazine do not need to be told that its special numbers will be attractive, helpful and saleable. The price, we understand, will be two and a half cents each, where more than twenty-five are ordered. Address Life and Health, 222 North Capitol St., Washington, D.C.

6. Foreign Papers.—The German paper Hausfreund, the Swedish paper Vaktaare, the Danish paper Sendebud, are all published by the International Publishing Association, College View, Nebraska. At this writing, August 9th, the publishers have not definitely decided whether to issue a series or one special number of each of these papers. Address any inquires to the association as above.

7. Forty Per Cent Books.—These books are especially for those who can not consistently leave home duties to engage exclusively in the sale of our large subscription books, but who can use a few hours, days or weeks in working among their friends and neighbors. A discount of forty per cent from the retail price, with postage or express added, is given to those who sell them. In taking up work for these books, it is not necessary to consult your state agent, as the territory for them belongs to the churches, and may be divided up at their discretion. Simply make arrangements with your librarian for obtaining the books, and go to work. The following is a list of these books:—

Yours very truly,
