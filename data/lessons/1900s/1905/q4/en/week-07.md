### Notes

1. The Jews had been praying for Esther, and in answer to their prayers, Esther was led to defer her request until the Lord had prepared the way for her request to be granted.

2. An invitation to Esther's banquet meant much. In Oriental countries it is very unusual for ladies to dine with any man, except those of their own family. Haman had reason to be proud of receiving an invitation to the queen's banquet.
