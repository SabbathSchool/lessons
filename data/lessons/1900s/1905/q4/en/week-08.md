### Notes

1. Haman was like the wicked in the last days. "In some places, before the time for the decree to be executed, the wicked rushed upon the saints to slay them; but angels, in the form of men of war, fought for them."â€”Early Writings, page 143.

2. Haman, filled with shame and hatred, could but see in it the beginning of his downfall. Mordecai, meekly and humbly trusting God, must have taken it as an evidence that God had answered prayer for the deliverance of the Jews.

3. Mordecai was not filled with pride; he humbly returned to his post of duty at the king's gate; but Haman, unfitted for business, returned to his home.

"Prayerfully consider the unentered fields."
