## Notes

That the everlasting Gospel for this generation, as proclaimed in the Threefold Message of Rev. 14:6-12, is to be a message of righteousness by faith has been made clear by the study of the Scriptures. The spirit of prophecy bears testimony to the same effect. This is expressly stated in the following extract which deals with the message presented at the General Conference at Minneapolis in 1888: "This message was to bring more prominently before the world the uplifted Saviour, the Sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. It presented justification through faith in the Surety; it invited the people to receive the righteousness of Christ, which is made manifest in obedience to all the commandments of God. Many had lost sight of Jesus. They needed to have their eyes directed to His divine person, His merits, and His changeless love for the human family. All power is given into His hands, that He may dispense rich gifts unto men, imparting the priceless gift of His own righteousness to the helpless human agent. This is the message that God commanded to be given to the world. It is the third angel's message, which is to be proclaimed with a loud voice, and attended with the outpouring of His Spirit in a large measure."—"Special Testimony to Battle Creek Church," published in 1896, pages 35, 36.

Righteousness by faith is to be proclaimed to the people of this generation, not as an abstract truth but as a living experience which will be revealed in keeping all the commandments of God. The third angel's message is such a presentation of the fundamental truth of righteousness by faith as will recover truths which have been set aside, restore in their original purity those truths which have been perverted, and present the complete Gospel according to the outline given in Rev. 14:6-12 in such a way as "to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
