## Notes

This lesson should be thoroughly mastered, as it is the basis of all the succeeding lessons of this series.

In the study of this lesson the following facts ought to stand out clearly: That the Gospel is the revelation of God's righteousness; that this righteousness comes to us as a gift (Rom. 5:15-18) entirely apart from any works of ours; that it is received by receiving or believing on Christ; that we are thus made righteous "freely" by the grace of God; that by this manifestation of His own righteousness God is able to account the ungodly as righteous, while still maintaining His own righteous character; that the faith which justifies us also establishes the law of God in the heart; that God gave His Son to become one with the human family in order that the righteous law might be fulfilled in humanity, being written in the hearts of all believers; that the keeping of the law of God is the evidence of genuine justification; that "the everlasting Gospel" of this threefold message is the Gospel of righteousness by faith; and that the only way of keeping the commandments of God is by being made righteous by faith, as the keeping of the commandments is the fruit of salvation rather than the price of salvation.

"When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be borne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is wholly distinct from faith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His word, are facts that even Satan and his hosts can not at heart deny. The Bible says that 'the devils also believe, and tremble;' but this is not faith. Where there is not only a belief in God's word, but a submission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him, the affections fixed upon Him, there is faith, —faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. Through this faith the heart is renewed in the image of God. And the heart that in its unrenewed state is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, now delights in its holy precepts, exclaiming with the psalmist, 'O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day.' And the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us, 'who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.'"—"Steps to Christ," pages 69, 70.

"'For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.' That is to say, faith which is not feigned or hypocritical, but true and lively. This is that faith which exerciseth and requireth good works through love. It is as much as to say, He that will be a true Christian indeed, or one of Christ's kingdom, must be a true believer. Now he believeth not truly, if works of charity [love] follow not his faith. So on both hands, as well on the right hand as on the left, he shutteth hypocrites out of Christ's kingdom. On the left hand He shutteth out the Jews, and all such as will work their own salvation, saying, 'In Christ neither circumcision;' that is to say, no works, no service, no worshipings, no kind of life in the world, but faith, without any trust in works or merits, availeth before God. On the right hand He shutteth out all slothful and idle persons, which say, If faith justify without works, then let us work nothing, but let us only believe, and do what we list. Not so, ye enemies of grace. Paul saith otherwise. And although it be true that only faith justifieth, yet he speaketh here of faith in another respect; that is to say, that after it hath justified, it is not idle, but occupied and exercised in working through love. Paul therefore in this place setteth forth the whole life of a Christian man, namely, that inwardly it consisteth in faith toward God, and outwardly in charity [love] and good works toward our neighbor. So that a man is a perfect Christian inwardly through faith before God, who hath no need of our works, and outwardly before men, whom our faith profiteth nothing, but our charity [love] or our works."—"Commentary on Galatians," Martin Luther, pages 475, 476.
