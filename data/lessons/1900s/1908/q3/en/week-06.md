## Notes

1. It was a time of greater peril to the work when the adversaries tried to make friendly overtures than when they were openly fighting against it.

2. The nobles of Judah had mingled with the company of Tobiah until they could not discern spiritual things. History repeats itself, and "Those who have step by step yielded to worldly demands, and conformed to worldly customs, will not find it a hard matter to yield to the powers that be, rather than subject themselves to derision, insult, threatened imprisonment, and death. The contest is between the commandments of God and the commandments of men. In this time, the gold will be separated from the dross in the church. True godliness will be clearly distinguished from the appearance and tinsel of it. Many a star that we have admired for its brilliancy, will then go out in darkness. â€”"Testimonies for the Church," Vol. 5, page 81.
