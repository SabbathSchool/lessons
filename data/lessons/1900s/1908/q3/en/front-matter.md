## Whose Debtors We Are

There are millions in China, Japan, Africa, and India, dying for want of the Bread of Life which God has given Christians to dispense to the hungry. Christ has purchased us that we might be linked with Him in saving others. Therefore, as was Paul, we are "debtors both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise." Rom. 1:14.

# Sabbath-School Lessons on the Book of Nehemiah

Senior Division

Third Quarter, July 1, 1908

## General Notes

The book of Nehemiah was anciently connected with the book of Ezra, being a continuation of the account of the return of the exiles from Babylon and the restoration of Jerusalem. Ezra restored the temple and began a spiritual reform; Nehemiah built the walls; and together they joined in a second spiritual reformation.

This book is the last of the historical records of the Old Testament. At this time it appears that Ezra the scribe gathered together all the books which now comprise the Old Testament (except Malachi) and compiled the Scriptures, dividing them into three parts, first, The Law; secondly, The Prophets; and thirdly, the Hagiographa, i.e., the holy writings. To these divisions our Saviour apparently made reference when He said, "These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things might be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning Me."

The life of Nehemiah is a worthy example. He gladly left a position bringing both honor and wealth for one of arduous toil and persistent opposition, because the cause of God needed him. He was a skilful organizer, and a zealous worker; a man of great integrity, and sound faith; who could neither be frightened by the threats of the enemies of the Lord nor seduced by their flatteries. He relieved the oppressed, but punished the oppressor.

A proper study of this book will help us to stand for the same reforms at this time—a separation from the world, a strict observance of the true Sabbath, the conscientious payment of our tithes and offerings, a tender care for the poor and distressed—and give us courage in the face of our enemies to be fearless of their threats but fearful of their blandishments.
