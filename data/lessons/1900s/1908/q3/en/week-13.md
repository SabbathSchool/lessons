## Notes

1. "It is a dangerous thing to form a worldly alliance. Satan well knows that the hour that witnesses the marriage of many young men and women closes the history of their religious experience and usefulness. They are lost to Christ. They may for a time make an effort to live a Christian life; but all their strivings are made against a steady influence in the opposite direction. Once it was a privilege and a joy to them to speak of their faith and hope; but they become unwilling to mention the subject, knowing that the one with whom they have linked their destiny takes no interest in it. As the result, faith in the precious truth dies out of the heart, and Satan insidiously weaves about them a web of skepticism."

"Spiritual declension commences the moment the vow is made at the altar; religious fervor is dampened, and one stronghold after another is broken down, until both stand side by side under the black banner of Satan. Even in the festivities of the wedding, the spirit of the world triumphs against conscience, faith, and truth. In the new home the hour of prayer is not respected. The bride and bridegroom have chosen each other, and dismissed Jesus." —"Testimonies for the Church," Vol. 4, pages 504, 505.

"Hundreds have sacrificed Christ and Heaven in consequence of marrying unconverted persons. Can it be that the love and fellowship of Christ are of so little value to them that they prefer the companionship of poor mortals? Is Heaven so little esteemed that they are willing to risk its enjoyments for one who has no love for the precious Saviour?" —Ib., page 507.

2. "Then my eyes were taken from the glory, and I was pointed to the remnant on the earth. Said the angel to them, 'Will ye shun the seven last plagues? Will ye go to glory, and enjoy all that God has prepared for those that love Him, and are willing to suffer for His sake? If so, ye must die that ye may live. Get ready, get ready, get ready. Ye must have a greater preparation than ye now have, for the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. Sacrifice all to God. Lay all upon His altar,—self, property, and all, a living sacrifice. It will take all to enter glory. Lay up for yourselves treasure in Heaven, where no thief can approach, or rust corrupt. Ye must be partakers of Christ's sufferings here, if ye would be partakers with Him of His glory hereafter.'" —"Early Writings," pages 56, 57.
