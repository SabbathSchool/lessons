## Notes

1. Usury on money, or on anything used to relieve the unfortunate and the oppressed, seems to have been strictly forbidden in the word of God. Ps. 15:5. Under certain other conditions, however, they were permitted to take usury. Deut. 23:19, 20. We will do well to prayerfully study the principles involved, for it is no doubt as applicable to us today as to Israel anciently.

"In the view given me in Rochester, N.Y., Dec. 25, 1865, I was shown that the subject of taking usury should be considered by Sabbath-keepers. Wealthy men have no right to take interest from their poor brethren, but they may receive usury from unbelievers." —Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, page 534.

2. Although Nehemiah held the high position of governor, and no doubt had many opportunities to enrich himself if he so desired, yet he did not do so. He continued to work on the wall, and to set before all a splendid example of sacrifice. His example contains a lesson which is well worthy of study at this time. No people should be more willing to sacrifice than those upon whom the end of the world has come.

3. The Lord is not unmindful of the little sacrifices made in behalf of His servants who are carrying burdens in His work. The giving of a cup of cold water is not forgotten. Matt. 10:42. It is the little things in life which settle our destiny. With this thought in mind, read Matt. 25:34-46.

4. "Whenever God's people, in any period of the world, have cheerfully and willingly carried out His plan in systematic benevolence and in gifts and offerings, they have realized the standing promise that prosperity should attend all their labors just in proportion as they obeyed his requirements. When they acknowledged the claims of God, and complied with His requirements, honoring Him with their substance, their barns were filled with plenty. But when they robbed God in tithes and offerings, they were made to realize that they were not only robbing Him but themselves; for He limited His blessings to them, just in proportion as they limited their offerings to Him." —"Testimonies for the Church," Vol. 3, page 395.
