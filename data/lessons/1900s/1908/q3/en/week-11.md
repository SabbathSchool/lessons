## Notes

1. The Ammonites and Moabites were not excluded from the congregation simply because they belonged to those nations, but because of their evil character. Tobiah retained the character of his ancestors who did evil in the sight of the Lord. Deut 23:3, 4; but Ruth, the Moabitess, who loved the Lord and chose His service, was the honored great grandmother of David and is reckoned in the genealogy of Christ. Ruth 4:10, 13, 17.

2. After the wall was dedicated and the various reforms in the temple service introduced, it seems that Nehemiah fulfilled his promise to the king and queen and returned to Babylon. Neh. 2:6. How long he remained in Babylon is not recorded.

3. "The work of God, which should be going forward with tenfold its present strength and efficiency, is kept back, like a spring season held by the chilling blast of winter, because some of God's professed people are appropriating to themselves the means that should be dedicated to His service. Because Christ's self-sacrificing love is not interwoven in the life practices, the church is weak where it should be strong. By its own course it has put out its light, and robbed millions of the Gospel of Christ." —"Review and Herald," Oct. 13, 1896.

"Let the church appoint pastors or elders who are devoted to the Lord Jesus, and let these men see that officers are chosen who will attend faithfully to the work of gathering in the tithe. If the pastors show that they are not fitted for their charge, if they fail to set before the church the importance of returning to God His own, if they do not see to it that the officers under them are faithful, and that the tithe is brought in, they are in peril. They are neglecting a matter which involves a blessing or a curse to the church. They should be relieved of their responsibility, and other men should be tested and tried." —"Review and Herald," Dec. 1, 1896.
