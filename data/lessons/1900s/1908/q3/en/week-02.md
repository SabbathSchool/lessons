## Notes

1. The year of Artaxerxes' reign did not coincide with the sacred year of the Jews, but commenced in the sacred year between the months Nisan and Chislev; consequently the interval between Chislev of Artaxerxes' twentieth year and Nisan of the same year is to be determined by counting forward from Chislev of the sacred year of the Jews to the Nisan of the following sacred year.

2. One who acted as cup-bearer to the king was expected always to be cheerful. He had it in his power to take the life of the king; and if he looked unhappy the king might suspect some plot and he be killed; for this reason Nehemiah was "sore afraid" when the king noticed his sad countenance.

3. "In the sight of men the self-sufficient worker may seem to be moving the world, but in the sight of God, the humble wrestler moves heaven. The hosts of God are interested in the humble, praying man, who dares not make a move without first coming in prayer into the presence of God to counsel with the Omnipotent." â€”Mrs. E. G. White in "Review and Herald," July 4, 1893.
