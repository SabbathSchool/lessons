## Notes.

1. The redeemed saints alone will possess the requisite qualification for acting the part of messengers or heralds in making known the story of Redemption to the principalities and powers in all the heavenly places—unfallen worlds. Being themselves the monuments of grace, having on the blood-washed garments of salvation, and bearing in their very persons the marks of the grace of God, having learned by experience the wondrous depths of redeeming love and grace, they will be able to speak of salvation and make known "the exceeding riches of His grace," as neither sinless angels nor unfallen beings can do.

2. Jesus when on earth said, "The Son can do nothing of Himself." This expresses man's condition without God. He is helpless. He has no strength. By nature he is carnal, sold under sin. His resolutions to do good are like ropes of sand. The good we will to do is left undone, and the things we hate we do. But through faith there is help for every tempted soul.

"Jesus says, 'What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.' There is a condition to this promise—that we pray according to the will of God. But it is the will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life. So we may ask for these blessings and believe that we receive them, and thank God that we have received them. It is our privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame or remorse. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

"Henceforth you are not your own; you are bought with a price. 'Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.' Through this simple act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has begotten a new life in your heart. You are now as a child born into the family of God, and He loves you as He loves His Son." —"Steps to Christ," pages 62, 63.
