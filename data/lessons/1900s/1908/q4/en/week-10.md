## Notes.

1. Note the "wherefore" in verse 25. If the "old man with his deeds" has been put off, and the "new man" has been put on, then the fruits of godliness will surely follow.

2. "The difficulties we have to encounter may be very much lessened by that meekness which hides itself in Christ. If we possess the humility of our Master, we shall rise above the slights, the rebuffs, the annoyances to which we are daily exposed, and they will cease to cast a gloom over the spirit. The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian is self-control." â€”"Desire of Ages," page 301.
