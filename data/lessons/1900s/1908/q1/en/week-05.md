## Notes

1. The sealing work here brought to view occurs after the signs in the sun, moon, and stars which appear as heralds of the coming of Christ, and before the rolling together of the heavens as a scroll. Chronologically, therefore, this work must take place in the very time in which we live, and constitute a work now being carried forward in the earth.

2. The 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7, have the seal of the living God. The same company is mentioned in Revelation 14. Here they are said to have the Father's name written in their foreheads. Evidently the seal of the living God and the Father's name in these texts mean the same thing.

3. The work brought to view in Ezekiel 9 is without doubt prophetic of the sealing work of Revelation 7. The mark, or seal, is placed in the forehead. It should be noted that to receive the seal of God as here set forth, means much more than merely to assent to a theological truth, and outwardly to obey the same. Only those are sealed that "sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof." This indicates a deep personal experience, such as can only be wrought by the power of the Holy Spirit in the human heart. This should lead us in the study of this subject to deep personal self-examination, and renewed consecration.

4. The use of the seal authenticating documents of importance dates from ancient times. Webster defines a seal as follows: "An instrument, or device; as an engraved metallic plate or stone, sometimes set in a ring, used for making an impression upon some tenacious substance, as wax or wafer, when attached to a parchment or paper, either in attestation of the genuineness of the instruments and the deliberation with which it is executed, or to foster it." See Esther 3:12; 1 Kings 21:8, for Scripture instances of its use.

5. It is clear from this Gospel prophecy that the law of God has a seal. A true seal defines who the lawmaking power is, his right to rule, and the territory over which his dominion extends. The seal of God's law will, therefore, set forth its Author in the clearest manner possible.

6. The Lord calls the Sabbath a sign, or seal. The Sabbath as the seal of the law is incorporated in the bosom of His law. The law of God being an expression of the eternal and everlasting righteousness of its Author, and all the commandments being righteousness, the seal of the law becomes a seal of righteousness. In the fourth commandment we have the name of the Lawmaker, Jehovah; His title, Creator; and the extent of His dominion, heaven and earth. This distinguishes the Author of the Decalogue from all false gods, and sets Him forth as a rightful lawgiver, and one who is able to save from sin.

7. The seal of the law is the holy Sabbath, which is the seventh day, and which God blessed and gave to man in the beginning. The Holy Spirit is the agent by whom the entire law, including the Sabbath, is written or impressed on our hearts. 2 Cor. 3:2, 3. Only those who are regenerated and born again through the Holy Spirit can receive the seal of God in the forehead.
