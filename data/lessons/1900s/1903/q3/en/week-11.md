# Lesson 11 - Practical Instruction

September 12, 1903

## Ephesians 5:15-28

(15) Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; (16) redeeming the time, because the days are evil. (17) Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. (18) And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; (19) speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; (20) giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; (21) subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.

(22) Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. (23) For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being Himself the Saviour of the body. (24) But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. (25) Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself up for it; (26) that He might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the Word, (27) that He might present the church to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. (28) Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself.

## Notes

1. The word "time" does not mean duration. Duration past can never return. "Opportunity" is the better word; and opportunity to work for Christ can be purchased by sacrificing the things of the world, of self, and of sin.

2. We may, nay, more, we should, understand the will of the Lord. But we can not do this by mere study. Such knowledge is always superficial. The only true understanding comes to the doer. John 7:17.

3. Note that the instruction to the wife is not to the husband, nor to the wife through the husband; it is from the Lord to the wife. The instruction of the husband is not to the wife, nor to the husband through the wife; it is from the Lord to the husband. If these simple facts be remembered, there will be no trouble, but much gain.
