# TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH
## Volume Seven

TIMELY instruction from God through His servant Sister White, on the various important lines of work connected with the Third Angel's Message.

Every minister, teacher, Bible worker, physician, and those especially who are connected in any way with our denominational institutions, should read the book and become familiar with God's plan relative to the great work He is carrying on in the earth, and thus be enabled to rightly relate themselves to them.

There is much in it to encourage, strengthen and cheer God's people in whatever condition they may be found.
