# Lesson 7 - The Unity of God

August 15, 1903

## Ephesians 4:1-10

(1) I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called, (2) with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; (3) giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. (4) There is one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling; (5) one Lord, one faith, one baptism, (6) one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. (7) But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. (8) Wherefore He saith, When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (9) (Now this, He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? (10) He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)

## Notes

1. "One baptism."—The baptism of the believer, or water baptism, is the outward act representing all other things which may be termed baptism, such as the baptism of suffering (Mark 10:38; Luke 12:50), and the baptism of the Spirit (Matt. 3:11). Baptism stands for death to sin and life in God, for suffering, dying, consecration, living, and so comprehends all other so-called baptisms. "One God."—God is one, not in person, but in character and spirit and purpose. The Father is here mentioned in contradistinction to the Son. He is over all, and through all, and in all, by His ever-present Spirit.

2. Christ came from the very highest heavens to the very lowest,—a grave in this sin-cursed earth. He emptied Himself absolutely. There was no place for existence which He did not touch, no class of fallen beings which He did not reach in that wonderful sacrifice. And then He ascended to lift all with Him who would to the eternal heights of holiness and happiness and life, to be children of God forevermore.
