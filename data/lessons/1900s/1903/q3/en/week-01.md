# Lesson 1 - Blessings of God

July 4, 1903

## Ephesians 1:1-12

(1) Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: (2) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(3) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ: (4) even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love: (5) having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, (6) to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: (7) in whom we have our redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, (8) which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, (9) making known unto us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him (10) unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in Him, I say, (11) in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His will; (12) to the end that we should be unto the praise of His glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.

## Notes

1. The epistle is written not only to the saints, the faithful at Ephesus, but to the faithful in Christ Jesus everywhere. It is therefore an epistle to us.

2. God is one, not in person, but in character, in purpose, in Spirit. The grace and peace are equally from our Father and our Elder Brother.

3. He has blessed us in accordance with His choosing. He chose us that we might be holy and without blame—both negatively and positively good. He has blessed sufficient to make us all He has chosen us to be. Note also that these are present blessings.

4. To predestine, or foreordain, means to mark out, to define or determine beforehand. God has the one standard character of holiness, the one ever all-glorious example, His Son Christ Jesus, reflecting always all the fulness of the light of His righteousness. God also in the beginning chose characters for His heritage, each character righteous in the righteousness of God, yet having its own individuality, manifesting one or more of the many beauties of Him in whom all fulness dwells, even as each color in the rainbow reveals some of the special beauties of the light. God chose these characters before the foundation of the world. The names of those characters were written in the Lamb's book of life. Rev. 13:8. He has called, and is calling to those characters, and His blessing is sufficient for every soul to meet the call and attain the character to which he is called.

5. Every work is to the praise or dispraise of its maker. God's work among sinners will be, when finished, to the praise of the glory of His grace. It is by grace, His unmerited favor, freely shed on us, that the work is wrought. This is preeminently an epistle of grace and glory. Twelve times is the grace bestowed mentioned,—"the glory of His grace," "the riches of His grace," "the exceeding riches of His grace;" and eight times does it speak of His "glory" to us-ward.

6. "According to." Oh, what a message of hope is this to the sinner! Not according to our deserts does God forgive, else would we never hope again. Not according to our conception, not according to any measure man can conceive, but according to "the riches of His grace." And that is as boundless as infinity, as endless as eternity. It is all free, if we will but take it—"grace to cover all my sin," "abounding in all wisdom and prudence." He does not throw it away, but it is always all-sufficient.
