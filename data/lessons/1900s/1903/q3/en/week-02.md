# Lesson 2 - The Fulness of His Power

July 11, 1903

## Ephesians 1:13-23

(13) In whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, (14) which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God's own possession, unto the praise of His glory.

(15) For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which ye show toward all the saints, (16) cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; (17) that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him; (18) having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of His calling, what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, (19) and what the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of His might (20) which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and made Him to sit at His right hand in the heavenly places, (21) far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: (22) and He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, (23) which is His body, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.

## Notes

1. Two mistakes are made in the lives of many who profess to be Christians. Either they believe that all good is enjoyed here, that the climax of all blessings is enjoyed in this sin-blasted earth, and hence they have no longing, no joy, no faith, in the exceeding riches of God's grace to be revealed: or they place all blessings in the life beyond, and hence fail to appreciate them here. All that God gives us here is the pledge of something better to come. Be glad and rejoice in His blessings in all the fulness that can be appreciated, but also know that, glorious as they are, they are only the earnest, the pledge, the first small payment, so to speak, of the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The eternal inheritance, the redemption of the entire universe, freed from sin and its results, are all to be shared by the believers in Christ Jesus.

2. "For this cause" includes the great purpose of God to make all things which man has subjected through sin to the praise of His glory. With this as a matter of thanksgiving Paul joins the faith and the love of believers.

3. These long sentences of the apostle need much study. It is one sentence from verse 3 to verse 14 inclusive. Verses 15 to 23 are also comprehended in one sentence. We shall need to study them as a whole and in parts. Every clause has its weight, every word its meaning. Note in verses 18 and 19 that it is not mere intellectual knowledge which is desired, for God's people, but that the eyes of the heart—the seat of the emotions, affections, will, and thought—may be illuminated, enlightened, that we may see and know beyond mortal vision and mortal knowledge. And all this knowledge is summed up in "the hope of His calling," "the riches of the glory of His inheritance," and "the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe,"—power over sin, and, hence, power over death. To know these is to know all that is worth knowing.
