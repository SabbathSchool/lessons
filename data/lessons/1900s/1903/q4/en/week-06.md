## Notes

1. In the year 606 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar carried the children of Israel to Babylon as captives.

2. "The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia." In His providence, Daniel held a high position in the king's court. Having knowledge that the seventy years were expiring, and having influence with the king, Daniel, no doubt, not only informed him that the prophecy indicated that the seventy years were fulfilled, but that God had foretold that Cyrus himself was the man who "shall perform all My pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid." Isaiah 44:28.

3. Under this proclamation of Cyrus, 42,360 of the Jews are said to have returned. But a careful study of that decree (Ezra 1:1-4) shows that ample provision was made that every Jew on the face of the earth might have hastened his steps toward his own land. Any Jew, living in any part of Cyrus' dominion, which was "all the kingdoms of the earth," who was too poor to go to Jerusalem, was to be provided, by "the men of his place," with all the money he needed for the journey, and sufficient to make an offering to the house of God when he got there.

4. The answer to Daniel's prayer involved some action on the part of the king of Persia. The enemies of Israel were attempting to frustrate God's purposes. "Ah, how little do we realize what is going on in the unseen world in relation to human affairs! Here, as it were, the curtain is for a moment lifted, and we catch a glimpse of the movements within. Daniel prays. The Creator of the universe hears. The command is issued to Gabriel to go to his relief. But the king of Persia must act before Daniel's prayer is answered, and the angel hastens to the Persian king. Satan, no doubt, musters his forces to oppose. They meet in the royal palace of Persia. All the motives of selfish interest and worldly policy which Satan can play upon he doubtless uses to the best advantage to influence the king against compliance with God's will, while Gabriel brings to bear his influence in the other direction. The king struggles between conflicting emotions. He hesitates, he delays. Day after day passes away, yet Daniel prays on. The king still refuses to yield to the influence of the angel; three weeks expire, and, lo, a mightier than Gabriel takes His place in the palace of the king, and Gabriel appears to Daniel to acquaint him with the progress of events."—Daniel and Revelation, page 218.

5. The latest prophecy concerning the return of the Jews to their own land was spoken in B.C. 487. In B.C. 445, forty-two years this side the latest prophetic utterance concerning their return, they were fully restored to their own land, and every promise made to that people was fulfilled on the Lord's part. Every promise made to that people was on condition of their keeping His commandments. If they had fulfilled their part, the promise would have been fulfilled to them that "every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours. . . . There shall no man be able to stand before you; for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as He hath said unto you." Deuteronomy 11:24, 25; Psalm 81:13-15.
