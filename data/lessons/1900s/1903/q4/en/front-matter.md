## HELP FOR AFRICA

We are giving an opportunity to the children to help the cause in Africa by taking subscriptions for the Little Friend.

Instead of the full 50 cents received from them for a new yearly subscription being appropriated by us to pay for the paper, we propose to send 20 cents of it to Africa.

Parents can not send their small children to foreign lands to be missionaries, but all can train them to be missionaries at home. Thousands of new subscribers can be obtained by the children if this special offer is brought to their attention, and thus a liberal sum be raised to help in carrying the gospel to the Dark Continent.

Parents, leaders in the young people's work, teachers of the children in the Sabbath-school, and any others coming in contact with the children of our people, this plan needs your co-operation to be a real success. Then, can we not depend upon you to help in bringing the plan to the attention of the children?

We want the names of all children who will try to carry out the plan, as we wish to write them, giving them general instructions regarding it. We wish also to send them copies of the Little Friend to use as samples.

Then, please write early to Our Little Friend, Oakland, Cal., telling of your interest in the plan, and giving the names of some to whom you have spoken about the matter and who wish to help.

# SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSONS ON GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD

FOR SENIOR CLASSES
Fourth Quarter, 1903

## Introductory Note

The lessons, as outlined for study, should be considered simply as a framework. Let the texts of Scripture cited be read, studied, and, as far as possible, committed to memory. Next, get the logical connection of these texts clearly in mind. Then let the practical and spiritual truth of each lesson—the coming of the promised Seed to restore this world to its rightful King—become a part of our personal experience. We shall then pray from the heart, "Thy kingdom come." He will then see in us "His seed." We shall then be fully "translated out of the kingdom of darkness, into the kingdom of His dear Son."
