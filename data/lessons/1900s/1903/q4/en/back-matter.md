# THE CITIES OF OUR WORLD

"The ungodly cities of our world are to be swept away by the besom of destruction. In the calamities that are now befalling immense buildings and large portions of cities, God is showing us what will come upon the whole earth."

As I recently rode down the Kansas River Valley and walked through some of its ruined towns, the above quotation from the Spirit of Prophecy came to my mind again and again. The question that followed it was, "How can I help show those with whom I have to do, that this is one of the signs of the times and that others will soon follow." The answer came clear and plain, "God has an appointed pioneer periodical which has been given us for this very purpose—THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES."

My brother, my sister, I am going to use this paper as never before. Will you unite with me?
