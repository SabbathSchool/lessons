# Lesson 13 â€” The Wisdom of the Righteous

MARCH 28, 1903

## PSALM 107:33-43

He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
And water-springs into a thirsty ground;
A fruitful land into a salt desert,
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
And a dry land into water-springs.
And there He maketh the hungry to dwell,
That they may prepare a city of habitation,
And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
And get them fruits of increase.
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
And He suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Again, they are diminished and bowed down
Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
He poureth contempt upon princes,
And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction,
And maketh him families like a flock.
The upright shall see it, and be glad;
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Whoso is wise will give heed to these things;
And they will consider the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah.

## Notes

While verses 33 to 37 show God's marvelous power to provide for His people, even in solitary places, an experience which awaits every faithful child of God before the final triumph of His work, there is no doubt that they also refer to the wondrous provision He has made for His people in the new earth, when the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. Isaiah 35; also 65:17-25.

Verses 38 to 42 are a wonderful commentary on that familiar verse, Rom. 8:28. Everything is in the hands of God. If there is prosperity, it comes from Him; if there are reverses, He permits them. God deals with man in the best way that will cause him to recognize his Creator. The righteous see these things, and rejoice now, and the time is coming when even the mouth of the wicked will be led to acknowledge the wisdom of God. Then it will be too late to accept His mercy, which is still offered. "To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts." "Behold, now is the day of salvation." This Sabbath should be the time when we submit our all to God, if we have not done so before, accepting everything that He sends as from the hand of a loving heavenly Father. The result, verse 43. See also 1 Cor. 13:12.
