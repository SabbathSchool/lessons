# Lesson 6 â€” God's Power Manifested in Deliverance

FEBRUARY 7, 1903

## PSALM 105:26-38

He sent Moses His servant,
And Aaron whom He had chosen.
They set among them His signs,
And wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and made it dark;
And they rebelled not against His words.
He turned their waters into blood,
And slew their fish.
Their land swarmed with frogs
In the chambers of their kings.
He spake, and there came swarms of flies,
And lice in all their borders.
He gave them hail for rain,
And flaming fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and their fig trees,
And brake the trees of their borders.
He spake, and the locust came,
And the grasshopper, and that without number,
And did eat up every herb in their land,
And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
He smote also all the first-born in their land,
The chief of all their strength.
And He brought them forth with silver and gold;
And there was not one feeble person among His tribes.
Egypt was glad when they departed;
For the fear of them had fallen upon them.

## Notes

Read also Ps. 78:43-52.

Moses' preparation for service deserves more than casual study. That decree which brought sadness and gloom into the homes of the Hebrews was used by the Lord to fit the man whom He had chosen to lead His people out of Egypt when the fullness of the time should come.

The circumstances which would not permit Moses' parents to rear him in their own home led to his being placed where he could receive the training and education that would fit him to be Israel's future leader.

Note Moses' fidelity to God when the crisis came in his life (Heb. 11:23-26); read also Ps. 84:11; and the hope which buoyed him up in these trying hours (Heb. 11:26, 39, 40).

But Moses' preparation was not complete when he had served in the Egyptian court. Forty years were spent in the solitude of the mountains, where he could become acquainted with God. Read "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 251.

Do not fail to observe the practical lessons in the life of Moses.

A study of the plagues reveals the fact that they seemed to be designed to destroy the confidence of the Egyptians in the power and protection of their idols. Note 5 in the Appendix to "Patriarchs and Prophets" will throw some light on this subject. By reference to the history itself (Exodus 7 to 13), we find that some of the Egyptians did have their faith shaken in their idols, and saw in these things the finger of God. See also "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 279.

"The plagues upon Egypt were similar in character to those more terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final deliverance of God's people." Ps. 91:1, 10. Now, while Jesus still intercedes for us, the preparation must be made that will enable us to stand in the trying times before us.
