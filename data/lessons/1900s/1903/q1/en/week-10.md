# Lesson 10 â€” The Result of Disobedience

MARCH 7, 1903

## PSALM 106:34-48

They did not destroy the peoples,
As Jehovah commanded them,
But mingled themselves with the nations,
And learned their works,
And served their idols,
Which became a snare unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
And shed innocent blood,
Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;
And the land was polluted with blood.
Thus were they defiled with their works,
And played the harlot in their doings.
Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against His people,
And He abhorred His inheritance.
And He gave them into the hand of the nations;
And they that hated them ruled over them.
Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Many times did He deliver them;
But they were rebellious in their counsel,
And were brought low in their iniquity.
Nevertheless He regarded their distress,
When He heard their cry;
And He remembered for them His covenant,
And repented according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.
He made them also to be pitied
Of all those that carried them captive.
Save us, O Jehovah our God,
And gather us from among the nations,
To give thanks unto Thy holy name,
And to triumph in Thy praise.
Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
From everlasting even to everlasting.
And let all the people say, Amen.
Praise ye Jehovah.

## Notes

The book of Judges is the story of repeated apostasy and rebellion and deliverances. The second chapter shows how compromise with the world caused the troubles of the people. A precious lesson for times of distress is that in Judges 6:12-14.

The prayer of the psalmist in verse 47 is especially appropriate for these days, when God is gathering out His people from among the nations to triumph in His praise. There is triumph in praise, as there is defeat in murmuring. In the gathering of His people in these last days, we are to see again His power to deliver and save as in ancient days. Jer. 16:14, 15; Isa. 11:10-12. Review the whole psalm, and see how much murmuring and apostasy would have been saved had people but trusted God. The psalm begins and ends with the same cry, "Hallelujah." It is the battle-cry of Christian warfare.
