# Lesson 12 â€” A Saviour from Sin and Distress

MARCH 21, 1903

## PSALM 107:17-32

Fools because of their transgression,
And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Their soul abhorreth all manner of food;
And they draw near unto the gates of death.
Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He saveth them out of their distresses.
He sendeth His word, and healeth them.
And delivereth them from their destructions.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness.
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
And declare His works with singing.
They that go down to the sea in ships,
That do business in great waters;
These see the works of Jehovah,
And His wonders in the deep.
For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They mount up to the heavens,
They go down again to the depths;
Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
And are at their wits' end.
Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He bringeth them out of their distresses.
He maketh the storm a calm,
So that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad because they are quiet;
So He bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,
And praise Him in the seat of the elders.

## Notes

With verse 19 many illustrations may be drawn from Old and New Testament history, showing God's speedy deliverance when His people sought Him. Jacob, the children of Israel before the Red Sea, Daniel, the three Hebrews in Babylon, Hezekiah, Peter, Paul, and many other instances, will suggest themselves.

The power of His Word (Ps. 33:6-9) heals the sick. With verse 30, read Matt. 8:8; Luke 7:7; Ps. 103:2-4; Isa. 53:4, R. V., margin.

The experience recorded in Mark 4:36-40 is an excellent comment on verses 23-30. He who created the sea can speak peace to its troubled waters. But still more precious is the promise of peace to the troubled soul that calls upon Him. John 14:27; 16:33; Rom. 5:1; Phil. 4:6, 7. There is power in His Word to perform that which He speaks. "All His biddings are enablings."

The last verse of the lesson makes clear the obligation to speak God's praise in the public congregation. Mal. 3:16-18. This is especially enjoined upon those who see the end approaching. Heb. 10:25.
