# Lesson 7 â€” God's Purpose in Deliverance

FEBRUARY 14, 1903

## PSALM 105:39-45

He spread a cloud for a covering,
And fire to give light in the night.
They asked, and He brought quails,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;
They ran in the dry places like a river.
For He remembered His holy word,
And Abraham His servant.
And He brought forth His people with joy,
And His chosen with singing.
And He gave them the lands of the nations;
And they took the labor of the peoples in possession;
That they might keep His statutes,
And observe His laws.
Praise ye Jehovah [Hallelujah].

## PSALM 106:1-5

Praise ye Jehovah.
Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for He is good;
For His loving-kindness endureth forever.
Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah,
Or show forth all His praise?
Blessed are they that keep justice,
And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that Thou bearest unto Thy people;
Oh visit me with Thy salvation,
That I may see the prosperity of Thy chosen,
That I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation,
That I may glory with Thine inheritance.

## Notes

Ps. 78:14; 1 Cor. 10:1, 2; Ps. 84:11 should be studied with verse 39.

"By day the cloud directed the journeyings, or spread as a canopy above the host. It served as a protection from the burning heat, and by its coolness and moisture afforded grateful refreshment in the parched, thirsty desert. By night it became a pillar of fire, illuminating their encampment, constantly assuring them of divine presence." Read Isa. 4:5, 6. "Here reference is made to the pillar of cloud and of fire to represent God's care for His people in the great final struggle with the power of evil."

The cloud that flooded the entire encampment of the Hebrews with the radiance of day was a wall of darkness to the Egyptians. Read with this Ps. 77:17, 18, R. V. and "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 287. The way that God marks out for His people will be flooded with light, although the unbelieving will not see it.

The manna was a type of Jesus, the Bread of life. John 6:48-51. Read also Rev. 2:17; 1 Cor. 10:3.

With verse 41 read Ps. 78:15, 16. "Moses smote the rock, but it was the Son of God who, veiled in the cloudy pillar, stood beside Moses, and caused the life-giving water to flow." Ps. 65:9; Rev. 22:1; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 4:13, 14; 7:37, 38.

Verse 42; Gen. 15:12-14, and Acts 7:6, 7, record the covenant with Abraham. For the blessing of this covenant to Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise, see Heb. 6:11-20.

Verse 43, with Ps. 116:12, 13; Psalm 33.

God brought forth His people that they might observe His statutes and keep His laws. The same is true in regard to His people to-day.

In all these experiences God designed to teach His people their utter dependence upon Him, and not merely on the man Moses, who was their leader.
