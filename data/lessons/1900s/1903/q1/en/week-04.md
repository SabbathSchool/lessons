# Lesson 4 â€” An Exhortation to Make Known the Wondrous Works of God

JANUARY 24, 1903

## PSALM 105:1-13

Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon His name;
Make known among the peoples His doings.
Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him;
Talk ye of all His marvelous works.
Glory ye in His holy name;
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
Seek ye Jehovah and His strength;
Seek His face evermore.
Remember His marvelous works that He hath done,
His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
O ye seed of Abraham His servant,
Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
He is Jehovah our God;
His judgments are in all the earth.
He hath remembered His covenant forever,
The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
The covenant which He made with Abraham,
And His oath unto Isaac,
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,
To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
The lot of your inheritance;
When they were but a few men in number,
Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
And they went about from nation to nation,
From one kingdom to another people.

## Notes

Continuing the subject of the previous lesson, the psalmist exhorts us to call upon the name of the Lord, giving thanks to Him. He would have this done intelligently, and so suggests that the deeds of the Most High be made known among the people, both in song and in conversation with our associates. This, followed out, would work reform in many ways.

We in these last days are especially to consider the dealing of God with His children in olden times. Isa. 51:1; Ps. 44:1-3.

Notice the promise to Abraham (Gen. 13:14-17), oath confirmed to Isaac (Gen. 26:2-5), and then to Jacob (Gen. 35:10-12). It is the promise of the inheritance and everlasting life through faith. Gal. 3:29.
