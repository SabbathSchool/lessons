# OUR LITTLE FRIEND for 1903

Our Little Friend has become a household favorite. We know that it is read with pleasure by young and old. We are determined to do what can be done, not only to maintain but to greatly increase this interest. Besides the usual choice selections which regularly appear, several interesting series of articles will be added during the coming year, which will be most instructive as well as entertaining.

## SACRED THINGS
The old, old story is ever new and wonderful. The greatest care will be taken to draw many precious lessons of truth from the various loved incidents of the Word of God.

## STRANGE THINGS
This series will contain sketches of life in far-away lands, written by those who are or have been there. These articles will be made doubly interesting by the appropriate illustrations which will be used.

## COMMON THINGS
Under the title of "Uncle Ben's Cobble-stones," many of the common things of life will be talked about in a simple and instructive manner. Interesting features in connection with each will be described and illustrated. Light, air, water, salt, paper, flour, coal, etc., are among the subjects which "Uncle Ben" will consider in his happy way.

## LIVING THINGS
Different writers will contribute interesting stories about strange and familiar animals and birds. Numerous illustrations will also serve to make these sketches most profitable and entertaining.
