# Lesson 4 — The Reception of His Message

April 25, 1903

## 1 Thess. 2:13-20

"(13) And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe. (14) For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews; (15) who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men; (16) forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath of God is come upon them to the uttermost.

(17) But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire: (18) because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us. (19) For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at His coming? (20) For ye are our glory and our joy."

## Notes

1. The Word of God received as the word of men is nothing. It is as the touch of Jesus by the curious, careless crowd. The word of men accepted as the word of God is nothing, and worse than nothing. It leads to deification of the human, to slavish tyranny, to fanaticism. It is not faith to receive men's words; it is credulity. It is faith, and it is necessary to salvation, to receive the message of God as the Word of God, letting it have free course in our lives, and then only will its creative power effectually work wonders.

2. It is worthy of note that this church in Thessalonica became imitators, followers of the church of God in Judea. It is admitted by all candid students that the churches in Judea were Sabbath-keepers. Of course, well-instructed Christians must be. But it is expressly said that these Christians from among the Gentiles were in all their persecutions followers of the faithful in the very primitive churches. They were therefore Christian Sabbath-keepers.

3. Only Jesus Christ can understand the true minister's burden for the souls of those for whom he labors. There is coming to be a belief, and it is evident in practice, that plain preaching of the truth, mere formal requests put in mere nominal belief, and conventional visiting are all that is required of the minister of Christ. It was not so with Paul. He not only preached a full gospel, but he labored, travailed, night and day in tears and prayers for souls. His very life went out in soul anguish for them. He had no hope unless they were saved. Any crown given him would be a lie, unless he had conquered Satan in souls, the strongholds of sin. He could not be partaker in the joy of Christ if souls were not saved. His glory, his joy, his crown, at Jesus' coming were all to be wrought out here in his labor for souls. All who know Christ are ministers of His; and no soul will go alone into glory.

"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our watchword.
