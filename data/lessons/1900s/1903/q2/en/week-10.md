# Lesson 10 â€” Message of Comfort

June 6, 1903

## 2 Thess. 1:1-12

"(1) Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: (2) Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(3) We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth; (4) so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure; (5) which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer; (6) if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you (7) and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power in flaming fire, (8) rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus; (9) who shall suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of His might, (10) when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be marveled at in all them that believe (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day. (11) To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfil every desire of goodness and every work of faith, with power; (12) that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."

## Notes

1. The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written a year or more after the first. Its great theme is the coming of Christ. Both epistles were given not alone for those to whom they are immediately addressed, but for all in all time. The second epistle corrects some erroneous ideas the brethren had obtained, namely that the coming of Christ then impended. The apostle tells them that other events must intervene before Christ comes. He shows them, however, the importance of that coming to His people in all ages; for at that time all will receive their reward, both good and evil.

2. According to God's grace does He give; according as we appropriate it by faith will we receive and grow.
