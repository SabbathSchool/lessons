### EDUCATION

By MRS. E. G. WHITE

This valuable work could have been appropriately named "The Christian Teacher" or "The Christian Student," for it is indeed to either class a Treasure-house of Knowledge and Wise Counsel.

It is practically the author's life work. Besides presenting many timely truths regarding present defective systems of education it contains, in concentrated yet beautifully simple form, the glorious principles which have been given to us on this vital subject.

Those desiring copies from the first edition should order early.

# The Advocate of Christian Education

## A journal which advocates the principles of Christian Education

All parents feeling the need of suggestions relative to the proper training and education of their children to be Christian workers, and others who do not experience difficulties in these lines (if there be such) will find the Advocate to be a journal filled with suggestions that are practical and helpful.

Its department for Sabbath-school workers makes it almost indispensable to all engaged in this line of work. This department contains copious notes on the Sabbath-school lessons for intermediate, primary, and kindergarten divisions which are of much assistance to the teachers of these divisions.

The "Advocate" is published monthly, 50¢ per year  
Clubs of two or more to one address 40¢ per copy
