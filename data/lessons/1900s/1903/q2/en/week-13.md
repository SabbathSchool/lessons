# Lesson 13 — Important Instruction

June 27, 1903

## 2 Thess. 3:6-18

"(6) Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us. (7) For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; (8) neither did we eat bread for naught at any man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you: (9) not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us. (10) For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat. (11) For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies. (12) Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. (13) But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing. (14) And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed. (15) And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. (16) Now the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all. (17) The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. (18) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."

## Notes

1. This is the word of the Lord, and that church which fails to heed it will suffer. But it is worth while to study what it does not mean. It does not mean ill treatment of the person, nor arbitrary action in his absence, nor voting him out of the church without labor, nor leaving our responsibility of his soul to others, nor sympathizing with him in his wrong when some one has faithfully admonished him. It does not mean that any unchristlike course should be pursued toward him. It does not mean that we should stand with him in the wrong, but should labor to show him the wrong, and the whole intent of the labor should not be in any way to please ourselves, but to please God by the conversion of the wrong-doer, if possible. Read Matt. 18:15-17; Romans 14; Gal. 6:1, 2; James 5:19, 20. After all gospel means are exhausted, then, for the sake of Christ's cause, take the ultimate action of withdrawing from him, yet standing ever ready to help him.

2. Yet the apostle had the right to partake of their substance. He had given them spiritual food; surely they should be glad that he had the right to partake of their temporal food. See 1 Cor. 9:14-18. And yet in this very respect the apostle intimates that he did wrong in not teaching the church to bear burdens. If a Minister of God or a parent bears too many burdens, in the fulness of his heart, the children or members are strangely made selfish and thoughtless. For the best interests of all, it is good that each one learn to bear the yoke in his youth. There are some burdens which ought to be blessings to the children of God. See 1 Thess. 5:12, 13.

3. What a God is our God! It is grace and peace at the beginning; it is grace and peace at the close. The first word and the last word are a message of His goodness to the undeserving; and all the intermediate words are instruction, which, if heeded, will yield us all the blessings of His grace. Do not let the study of these epistles stop with these lessons.
