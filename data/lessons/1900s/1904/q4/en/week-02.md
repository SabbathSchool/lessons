## Note

The prophecy foretelling the forerunner of Christ was given seven centuries before the coming of Christ. Isa. 40:3. It was not fulfilled till the time came; then John appeared on the scene in fulfilment of the divine prediction. So also in the last days. When the Saviour is about to come the second time the Lord will raise up a people who will fulfil His word. The fact that some are said to scoff at the coming of the Lord is evidence that the subject will be agitated in the last days. Those who oppose it are called "scoffers."
