## Notes

1. Miracles will be wrought by these false Christs as a proof of their divine mission. As the final, almost overmastering delusion, Satan himself will appear personally, as a being of dazzling brightness, working miracles, and claiming to be the Son of God. Those only who understand the manner of Christ's coming will be able to withstand this deception. But to those who believe the Word the delusion is clearly unmasked, for Satan cannot counterfeit the manner of the Saviour's return, nor bring to pass the stupendous events with which it is attended.

2. How blessed the thought that it is the "Lord Himself," a personal being, who comes. The One with the wounded hands, and the pierced side,â€”"Himself," and not another.

3. In addition to those living when the Lord comes, some of the dead, both righteous and wicked, will be raised to witness His return. Those who did the most to heap upon Him shame when He was on earth as a man, will come forth from the tomb to see that face which they have despised shining as the sun. Some, also, of God's faithful children who have faithfully warned the world of His return, and fallen asleep waiting for Him, will be raised to see Him come in glory.
