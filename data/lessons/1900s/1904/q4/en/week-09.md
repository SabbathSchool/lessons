## Notes

1. Christ, being the Creator, He, of course, made the Sabbath, and gave it to man as a sign of His power. He is truly its Lord. Note that He blessed and sanctified the seventh day after He had rested. The first seventh day had then passed into eternity, so it could not have been this that the Lord commanded us to observe, but it was the seventh day for all time to come that He placed His blessing upon, and bade us keep holy in memory of Him.

2. The fact that the weekly cycle was known before Sinai (Gen. 8:10, 12; 29:27, 28) is clear evidence of the observance of the Sabbath, as there is nothing in nature which indicates a weekly cycle.

3. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden, before the footprint of sin was seen in the universe. Like the marriage institution, it comes to us as a relic from the home of purity of the father of the race. When the curse is removed, and the earth is made new, the redeemed will observe the Sabbath throughout eternity in honor of their Redeemer.
