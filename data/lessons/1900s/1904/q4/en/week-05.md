## Notes

1. Space will not permit us to give an array of facts showing how all these predictions of the Word are being fulfilled. Their fulfilment is written everywhere. The accumulated evidence all around us would fill volumes. See, in the increasing armies and navies and war spirit of the nations; the destructive conflagrations; devastations wrought by floods, and ruin wrought by tempest and cyclone; ruin by earthquake and volcanic eruption; pestilence and famine; in the unparalleled accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few, and the corresponding oppression of the poor, a fulfilment of the Word. Violence, as in the days of Noah, fills the earth, and the victims of intemperance, of mobs, strikes, murder, and suicide, move on in mournful procession, by the tens of thousands, to the tomb, as a reminder that the end is coming. The increase is appalling. All around us, in a thousand forms, we see the startling fulfilment of what the Lord has said. Meditate upon it. Study what you see, and let the voice of God, announcing through all these things the ruin of the world, and the everlasting end of sin and sorrow, speak to your soul.

2. The Lord has placed signs in the heavens, on the earth, in the sea, in society, among the nations, and in the hearts of men—in every place possible—and tells us that when we see the things fulfilled which He has foretold, He is near, even at the door; that the last generation of men is on the earth. Then He bids us watch and pray.

*"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."*
