# IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

In this issue of Life and Health is begun a most important series of articles by the Editor, entitled "A Celebrated Centenarian," being the first of a series of Studies from the Lives of Health Seekers.

Those who have read in this issue the interesting sketch of Cornaro, and the lessons to be learned from his experience, will surely desire to read the other articles in this series.

While each article will be complete in itself, the whole series will contain a large amount of most helpful suggestions made especially practical by the experience of some noted health seeker.

We are now able to announce the following articles in these important studies, and others are in preparation:—

- No Meat or Stimulants, but Abundant Proteid—How a famous athlete and author won his victories and increased his intellectual efficiency.
- Health by Hunger—Dr. Dewey and the fasting cure.
- Health by Chewing, or Nature's Food Filter—Horace Fletcher's discovery of a sixth sense.
- A Starchless Menu; Bread the Staff of Death—Dr. Densmore's milk and fruit dietary.
- The Strenuous Life, or Strength by Hard Work—President Roosevelt's practical physical culture.

We may learn much from the experiences of these representative health reformers, and while avoiding their extreme positions, may, through the helpful suggestions of Dr. Heald, benefit by their experiments.

Subscription price, 50 cents a year. Single copy, 5 cents. Send in your subscription at once and secure the whole of this interesting and valuable series.

The circulation of Life and Health is increasing rapidly. We printed more than three times as many of the July and August numbers as the June subscription list called for. Both the July and August numbers were sold out early. We are printing five times as many of the September number as the June list called for, and we hope to see a still larger increase for next month.
