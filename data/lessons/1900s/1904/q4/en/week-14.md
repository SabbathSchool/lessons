## Notes

1. "I was shown that the parable of the talents has not been fully understood. This important lesson was given to the disciples for the benefit of Christians living in the last days. And these talents do not represent merely the ability to preach and instruct from the Word of God. The parable applies to the temporal means which God has intrusted to His people. Those to whom the five and the two talents were given traded and doubled that which was committed to their trust. God requires those who have possessions here to put their money out to usury for Him—to put it into the cause to spread the truth. . . . I saw that some of God's professed people are like the man who hid his talent in the earth. They keep their possessions from doing good in the cause of God."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, pages 197, 198.

2. In Eden the test before man was whether he would recognize God's ownership, and let that alone which the Lord claimed as His. Man has a second probation, and the test is still the same. Of all that is in the earth, the Creator has made man the steward, but reserves one-tenth as His, not because He needs the money, for He could make the stones gold, but to see if man will recognize His ownership, and return to Him that which He has reserved.

3. "Let the neglected tithes be brought in. Let the new year open upon you as men honest in their deal with God. Let those that have withheld their tithes send them in before the year 1896 [1904 now] shall close, that they may be right with God, and never, never again run any risk of being cursed of God. . . . To the obedient He will give rich blessings; to the transgressor, a curse."—Special Testimony.
