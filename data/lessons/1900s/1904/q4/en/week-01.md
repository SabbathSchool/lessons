## Notes

1. "Enoch was troubled in regard to the dead. It seemed to him that the righteous and the wicked would go to the dust together, and that would be their end. He could not clearly see the life of the just beyond the grave. In prophetic vision he was instructed in regard to the Son of God, who was to die man's sacrifice, and was shown the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, attended by the angelic host, to give life to the righteous dead, and ransom them from their graves."â€”Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 1, pages 61, 62.

2. The Lord is making changes in character now. "He is effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, and all his confederacy of evil united against God and the law of His government, stands viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delusions." The change in our bodies will take place when Jesus comes.
