## Notes

1. The fact that those who are sealed are next seen on Mount Zion, redeemed from "among men," shows that the sealing work takes place just before the end.

2. A seal is that which gives authenticity to all legal documents, and must contain three specifications: (1) The name of the law-making power; (2) the authority for making the law; (3) the territory over which the law-making power has jurisdiction.

3. While other of the commandments contain the name of God, they do not define who He is. There are "gods many and lords many," the true God being defined by the fact that He created the heavens and the earth. Jer. 10:10-12. The fourth commandment contains the seal complete: (1) Name, God; (2) authority, Creator; (3) territory, heavens and earth.

4. The observance of the fourth commandment, or Sabbath, is the only thing in connection with the observance of the law which distinguishes a person at this time as a commandment keeper. This shows that the remnant church will be engaged in a Sabbath reform.

*"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."*
