# Lesson 6 - Last-day Conditions

NOVEMBER 5, 1904

**General Note**â€”The word "millennium" is from two Latin words, mille, thousand, and annum, year, and means a thousand years. It is frequently interpreted to mean a thousand years before the coming of Christ, when sin will cease to exist and righteousness will fill the earth. If this were true, the coming of Jesus would be indefinitely delayed, and the world could sleep on. That there will be no such period prior to the advent of our Lord, the Scriptures abundantly show. Let the object of the study of last-day conditions be especially to note that the "peace and safety" cry, together with the condition of the earth, are signs of the end, and that the Lord is soon coming.

## Note

1. Many will hear the proclamation of the end and coming destruction of the world, as it is sounded among the nations, and be impressed to flee from the coming storm. On the other hand, the "peace and safety cry," combined with the prevailing iniquity and vanity of the world, will be drawing them to perdition.

It is not stated that the Gospel will convert all the world. It never has in the past. It takes out of the nations a people for the Lord. The Lord gives all an opportunity to accept of salvation. The choice is left with them.

*"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."*
