# Lesson 8 — Babylon

AUGUST 20, 1904

## General Note

"Revelation 18 points to the time when, as a result of rejecting the threefold warning of Rev. 14:6-12, the church will have fully reached the condition foretold by the second angel, and the people of God, still in Babylon, will be called upon to separate from her communion. This message is the last that will ever be given to the world; and it will accomplish its work. When those that 'believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,' shall be left to receive strong delusion, and to believe a lie, then the light of truth will shine upon all whose hearts are open to receive it, and all the children of the Lord that remain in Babylon will heed the call, 'Come out of her, My people.'" —Great Controversy.

## Notes

1. The illicit connection between the church and worldly power is here clearly illustrated by the woman, a symbol of the church, seated upon a beast, a symbol of earthly government. The Church of Rome, with its gigantic organization, stands as chief representative of this iniquitous system, and is here called Babylon.

2. Some of the true people of the Lord are scattered throughout Babylon. In all the churches there are those who sigh and cry because of the abominations which are cherished in their midst. On these the Lord has His eye; they are dear to Him. And as the storm of indignation against sin gathers and is about to break, a voice from heaven, a mighty message, calls them to "come out of her." "Servants of God, endowed with power from on high, with their faces lighted up, and shining with holy consecration, went forth to proclaim the message from heaven. Souls that were scattered all through the religious bodies answered to the call, and the precious were hurried out of the doomed churches, as Lot was hurried out of Sodom before the destruction." —Early Writings, page 139.

3. With the plagues of wrath falling upon them, their earthly traffic gone, and unable to deliver themselves with their silver and gold, one universal cry of lamentation and woe is heard. In despair they will cast their treasures to the moles and bats (Isa. 2:17-21), and seek to hide themselves with these creatures of darkness in the dens of the earth. How true are the words of the prophet! Isa. 3:10, 11.

*We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field.*
