## Notes

1. The aged prophet was in exile on lonely Patmos. But though placed where he could not hear the church militant sing the song of Zion, his connection with heaven was not interrupted. In vision of the future, the Lord permitted His servant to hear the ransomed multitude sing and play upon the heavenly instruments. He heard the final song of victory over the beast and his image. His name was inscribed in the records of Rome's criminal annals, but the Lord encouraged His servant by showing him the city of God, with his name inscribed in the foundations of its wall. Rev. 21:14. The Lord is a present help in time of trouble. In the fiery furnace was seen the "form of the Fourth."

2. The saved will have the privilege of going with the Saviour and visiting all the worlds in the universe, and singing the song of their deliverance. The unfallen inhabitants of other worlds will listen with joy to the song of the 144,000, those who have come from the weakest generation of men, when the enemy was working with the greatest power. They can not join this redeemed choir, for they have never had such an experience. This glorious privilege is within the reach of each of us. See "Early Writings," page 33.
