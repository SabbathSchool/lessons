## Notes

1. The pope wears in jeweled letters on his triple crown the blasphemous title, "Vicarius Filii Dei,"—"Vicegerent of the Son of God." Taking the letters which the Latins used as numerals out of this title, and giving them their numerical value, we have just 666. Thus we have: V-5; I-1; C-100; A-0; R-0; I-1; U-5 (formerly the same as V); S-0; F-0; I-1; L-50; I-1; I-1; D-500; E-0; I-1.

2. "Here is a striking figure of the rise and growth of our nation. And the lamb-like horns, emblems of innocence and gentleness, well represent the character of our government, as expressed in its two fundamental principles—Republicanism and Protestantism." —Great Controversy.

3. The only power which was coming up at the time when the beast went into captivity in A.D. 1798, was the United States. The Declaration of Independence was signed in A.D. 1776, setting forth the truths that men are created equal, and endowed with the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Constitution was adopted and ratified April 30, 1789. Every specification touching the rise of this power is met in the rise of this nation, and the movements to fulfil the specifications indicated by the dragon voice are already far advanced.

4. "The light we have received upon the Third Angel's Message is the true light. The mark of the beast is exactly what it has been proclaimed to be." —Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, page 17.

God's law is a definition of His character. The fourth precept, enjoining the seventh day as the Sabbath, defines who the true God is. The beast sits in the temple of God, exalting himself above God, claiming even to be God, and having power to change His precepts. His purpose is to shut away from mankind the true God and substitute himself. To do this, he must necessarily change that commandment which defines who is the true God, and substitute one which will exalt himself. This the man of sin has done. When this change is enforced and accepted intelligently, the mark of the beast will be received. That Catholicism recognizes the substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath of Jehovah as the special mark of her power is acknowledged in her standard works. The following is clear:—

"Ques.—How prove you that the church has power to command feasts and holy days?
"Ans.—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore, they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church." —Abridgement of Christian Doctrine.

5. The characteristic feature of the beast as a persecuting power is a union of the church and the state, the church being the controlling power, and enforcing religious dogmas through the civil laws. An image to the beast would be another ecclesiastical power doing a similar work.

6. "In the conflict, the Sabbath will be the special point of controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular rulers and religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of the Sunday; and, as milder measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be enacted. It will be urged that the few who stand in opposition to an institution of the church and the law of the land ought not to be tolerated, and a decree will finally be issued denouncing them as deserving of the severest punishment, and giving the people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to death. Romanism in the old world, and apostate Protestantism in the new, will pursue a similar course toward those who honor the divine precepts."

"In one night they determine to strike the decisive blow that shall forever silence the voice of the reprover." —Great Controversy.

"The decree which is to go forth against the people of God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews in the time of Esther. . . . The Protestant world to-day see in the little company keeping the Sabbath a Mordecai in the gate." —Testimony Number 32, page 206.

*"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our watchword.*
