## Notes

1. The apostolic church is here introduced, and its history briefly outlined till the end. The glory of the Gospel, as revealed in the types and shadows (the moon), being in the past, she was clothed with greater Gospel light (the sun), and fully organized and filled with power; she went forth "conquering and to conquer."

2. Satan is symbolized by the dragon, as shown in verse 9. At the time of which the prophet is speaking he worked through Rome in pagan form.

3. When Satan overcame Adam, he became the prince of this world (John 14:30), and took Adam's place in the heavenly council as a representative from this world. Job 1:6-12. His relentless persecution of Christ revealed his true character to the universe, and, when Jesus died on the cross, he was again cast out. He lost his place in the council of heaven, and the second Adam appears now instead. From Rev. 12:4 and "Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 1, pages 22, 23, it seems that about one-third of the angels sympathized with him, and were cast out of heaven with Lucifer. By a comparison of this statement with the unnumbered host that remains faithful (Rev. 5:11), we can gain some idea concerning the number of fallen angels with which the church must cope.

4. "Satan again counseled his angels, and with bitter hatred against God's government told them that while he retained his power and authority upon the earth, their efforts must be tenfold stronger against the followers of Jesus. They had prevailed nothing against Christ, but must overthrow His followers, if possible. In every generation they must seek to ensnare those who believe in Jesus. He related to his angels that Jesus had given His disciples power to rebuke them and cast them out, and to heal those whom they would afflict. Then Satan's angels went forth like roaring lions, seeking to destroy the followers of Jesus." —Early Writings, page 59.

5. The 1260 years of papal supremacy as a persecuting power are here brought to view, beginning in A.D. 538, and ending in A.D. 1798. The church was indeed in the wilderness during this time. "That church which, during all the Dark Ages, trumpeted her lordly commands into the ears of listening Christendom, and flaunted her ostentatious banners before gaping crowds, was not the church of Christ; it was the body of the mystery of iniquity." —Thoughts on Revelation.

6. "The Reformation of the sixteenth century began its work. God raised up the noble Luther and his colaborers to expose the true character of the Papacy, and break the power with which superstition had enslaved the minds of the people." —Thoughts on Revelation.

7. The remnant church is distinguished by three things: (1) They are a persecuted people; (2) they keep the commandments of God; (3) they have the "Spirit of prophecy." We can not consistently believe that the end is near and the remnant church now doing its work in the earth, unless we believe that there is a church which has all these characteristics.

8. "Satan is constantly encouraging unbelief. He notes the mistakes and failings of Christ's professed followers, and taunts the angels of God with them. He is an accuser of the brethren, and he will influence as many as possible to do the same work. Those who take it upon themselves to watch their neighbor's garden, instead of weeding their own plot of ground, will surely find their own gardens so grown up to weeds that every precious plant will be crowded out." —Testimonies for the Church, No. 32, page 42.
