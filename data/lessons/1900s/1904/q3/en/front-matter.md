### General Note

Under the symbols of a great red dragon, a leopard beast, and a beast with lamb-like horns, are represented the powers especially engaged in warfare against God's people. Their war is carried forward till the close of time, till only a remnant are left. That we live in the time when the final struggle is to take place, and the remnant be developed, and the long drawn-out controversy is to be finished, makes these studies of special interest. Note throughout these studies that out of the darkest hour in the history of the world, there will be a glorious deliverance of the remnant. Then before us is spread out in panoramic view Paradise restored, and the weary, worn, and faithful children of the Most High, of every age and clime, safe at home in the earth made new.
