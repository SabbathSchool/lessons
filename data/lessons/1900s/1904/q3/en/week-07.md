## Notes

1. "It was impossible for the plagues to be poured out while Jesus officiated in the sanctuary; but as His work there is finished, and His intercession closes, there is nothing to stay the wrath of God, and it breaks with fury upon the shelterless head of the guilty sinner, who has slighted salvation, and hated reproof. In that fearful time, after the close of Jesus' mediation, the saints were living in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. . . . The last tear for sinners had been shed, the last agonizing prayer offered, the last burden borne, the last warning given. The sweet voice of mercy was no more to invite them." —Early Writings, page 141.

"When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark, will be poured out. . . . These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful scourges that have ever been known to mortals." —Great Controversy.

2. The Turkish Empire is clearly symbolized by the River Euphrates in Rev. 9:14. There is no reason to believe that the Spirit uses the symbol here with a different meaning. Under this plague apparently the Ottoman power, which for so many years has been crumbling away, will be literally "dried up;" will come to its end. This fact is stated, though the steps in detail by which this will be brought to pass may not all be clearly given.

3. The Turk, having been driven from the soil of Europe, has established the capital of his kingdom at Jerusalem, and here in the valley of Jehoshaphat the terrible battle of Armageddon will take place. The preliminary steps to bring this to pass are now being seen among the nations. Truly this will be a time of trouble such as never was, a time of "confused noise, and garments rolled in blood." In the midst of the turmoil, the long-suffering God intervenes. The seventh vial is unstopped. He opens the armory of heaven, and brings forth the "weapons of His indignation," and pours out the reserved treasures of the hail. All the proud and stately nations of earth will be quickly overthrown.
