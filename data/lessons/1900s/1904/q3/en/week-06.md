# Lesson 6 — The Final Warning

AUGUST 6, 1904

## Note

"I then saw the third angel. Said my accompanying angel: 'Fearful is his work. Awful is his mission. He is the angel that is to select the wheat from the tares, and seal, or bind, the wheat for the heavenly garner. These things should engross the whole mind, the whole attention.'" —Early Writings, page 31 (Supplement).

## Notes

1. "I have been shown that but a small number of the people in our churches know for themselves what constitutes the Third Angel's Message." —Gospel Workers, page 229. The judgment message will continue till the close of time; likewise that of the second angel. With these go the terrible warning of the third angel, making a great threefold message with which to close human probation, and end the problem of sin.

2. The fact that this message follows the other two shows it to be world-wide, for they went to "every nation, kindred, and tongue, and people."

3. By consulting any standard Greek lexicon, it will be seen that, while the terms from which "for ever and ever" are translated sometimes mean absolute eternity of duration, they are also used to denote limited duration. Compare Ex. 21:6. They are used in the lesson text to indicate finality of punishment, as the beast and his image are to be entirely destroyed, and the territory they now occupy becomes the home of the redeemed. The doctrine of eternal torture in a lake of fire is contrary to the attributes of God, and foreign to the teachings of the Bible.

4. "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, descending to earth, and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfilment of some important event. Then I saw another mighty angel commissioned to descend to earth, to unite his voice with the third angel, and give power and force to his message. Great power and glory were imparted to the angel, and as he ascended the earth was lightened with his glory. . . . This message seemed to be an addition to the third angel, joining it as the midnight cry joined the second angel's message in 1844. . . . Mighty miracles were wrought, the sick were healed, and signs and wonders followed the believers. God was in the work, and every saint, fearless of consequences, followed the conviction of his own conscience, and united with those who were keeping all the commandments of God; and with power they sounded abroad the third message. I saw that this will close with power and strength far exceeding the midnight cry." —Early Writings, pages 137-139.
