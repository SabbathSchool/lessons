### Notes

1. God "hath committed all judgment unto the Son." He has also "appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness, by that Man whom He hath ordained." Therefore he who judges another has climbed up into the seat of God, thus saying that he is God. That is nothing short of the papacy, the man of sin. He not only assumes the prerogatives of God, but is meting out judgment before the time. "Let us not therefore judge one another any more."
