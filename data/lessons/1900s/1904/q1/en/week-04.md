### Notes

1. This vision having been given to Daniel in the third year of the reign of Belshazzar, that being the year when Babylon was overthrown, it must have been about B.C. 538.

2. Prophets in heavenly vision are often taken to places where the scenes opened up to them are to occur, so that they are living amid the very events predicted by them, even though those events may be thousands of years in the future.

3. The two horns on the ram symbolize the union of the two nations, the Medes and Persians. The higher coming up last signifies the fact that in a few years the Persian became the leading element in the kingdom.

4. It is a fact noted in history that Alexander died in a drunken debauch, at the age of thirty-two years, and at a time when his kingdom was in the very height of its glory and greatness. Thus the kingdom represented by this horn was broken "when he was strong."

5. While Alexander lived he made no provision as to who would succeed him in his kingdom. About twenty years after his death it was divided among his four strongest generals. The student should note carefully the following division of Alexander's kingdom, as it will have an important bearing upon the events studied in a future lesson in this series. Lysimachus had that portion lying to the north of Palestine, including Thrace, Bithynia, and some smaller provinces of Asia Minor. Ptolemy took that portion to the south, including Egypt, Libya, Arabia, and Palestine. Seleucus took the east,—Syria and all the country to the river Indus. Cassander had Macedon and Greece, lying to the west. Carefully note these divisions, as given in "Great Empires of the Bible."
