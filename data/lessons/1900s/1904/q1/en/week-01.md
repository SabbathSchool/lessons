### Notes

1. The special providence of God is seen in giving the dream; in causing it to make such an impression upon the king's mind that he could not forget that he had had a remarkable dream; in thus exposing the fraud of the so-called wise men of Babylon; in causing the king to overlook the wisest man in all Babylon, when he summoned the wise men to make known the dream; in causing the king to grant Daniel time (verse 20), which he had refused to do for the others; in thus bringing the king to acknowledge the true God (verse 47); in thus promoting Daniel to an exalted place in the kingdom, for the further accomplishment of the divine purpose.

2. The mighty empire that followed Grecia was Rome. Gibbon, the historian, adopts the very symbolism of the prophecy to describe the character of this crushing power as the successor of the earlier universal kingdom, speaking thus: "The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean; and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations or their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome." Later in its history the strength as of iron was weakened, and after the division into lesser kingdoms, the empire was indeed "partly strong and partly brittle," as the marginal reading puts it.

3. It is well known that, by intermarriage, the royal houses of Europe are more or less closely related; but by none of these matrimonial alliances have ruling houses been able to reunite the divided empire, which is to remain divided until the stone smites the image.
