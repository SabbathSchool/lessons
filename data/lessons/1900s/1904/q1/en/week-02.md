### Notes

1. Belshazzar reigned conjointly with his father, Nabonadius, during the last three years of the Babylonian Empire, and it was at the close of this three years' reign when, as the sacred historian records, "in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain, and Darius the Median took the kingdom." Dan. 5:30, 31. This being true, and that kingdom coming to its end in B.C. 538, it follows that this vision must have been about B.C. 541.

2. Inasmuch as in this vision four universal kingdoms span the history from Daniel's day to the end, just as in the dream of Daniel 2, the first beast here brought to view must symbolize the same power that was represented by the head of gold in the great image,—Babylon.

3. The kingdom of Babylon, as noticed in this prophecy, continued less than seventy years. More than half of that time the kingdom was ruled by Nebuchadnezzar. It was during his reign that the kingdom made all of its mighty conquests. His successors, each in turn, became less bold and aggressive, until the weak and pusillanimous Belshazzar, who possessed none of the brave and noble qualities of Nebuchadnezzar.

*The needs of the cause of God are world wide.*

4. The marginal reading of verse 5 says, "raised up one dominion." Darius, the Mede, and Cyrus, the Persian, were associated together in the conquest and overthrow of Babylon. As an act of courtesy on the part of Cyrus, the rulership of the newly-formed kingdom was given to his uncle, Darius. But in a short time the Persian became the ruling element in the kingdom. Thus the dual kingdom represented by the bear is said to have exalted one branch above the other.

5. The bear is a bloodthirsty animal, and that bloodthirsty disposition of the Medes and Persians is supposed to have been further stimulated by the overthrow of the three provinces of Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.

6. The two wings added to the lion fitly represented the rapidity of the conquests of that empire under Nebuchadnezzar. Upon this leopard beast are not only wings, which are unnatural to a beast, but also an unnatural number of wings. This most fittingly represents the unparalleled rapidity and celerity of the movements of the Grecians under the reign of the intrepid Alexander the Great, who, after conquering the then known world, died at the age of thirty-two years.

7. The four heads of this beast undoubtedly symbolize the four divisions of Alexander's kingdom among his four leading generals about twenty years after his death.

8. In the breaking up of the Roman dominion by the incursion of tribes from the northward, ten kingdoms were established upon the ruins within the boundaries of the old empire.
