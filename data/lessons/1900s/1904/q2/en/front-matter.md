### FOR SENIOR CLASSES

## Second Quarter, 1904

Note: These lessons are not to be a book study, but an outline study of the leading prophecies in the book. They will be but a survey of a book which we have been especially exhorted to study earnestly and prayerfully in order that we may understand the past history of the people of God and the closing work under the Third Angel's Message of the fourteenth chapter, which gives the special burden and key-note of the Gospel message for our time.
