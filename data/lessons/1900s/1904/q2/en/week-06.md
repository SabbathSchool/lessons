### Notes

1. These visions of heaven show how real and tangible is that place. Mysticism would make heaven but a state or condition; but heaven is a real place. Spiritual beings in bodily form dwell there and go to and fro. Men in redeemed flesh, who once lived on earth, as Enoch and Moses and Elijah, and our Lord and Saviour, in whose hands of flesh may be seen the prints of the nails, serve and dwell in heaven. There is the tree of life and the garden of Eden, trees that once rooted in the very soil of this earth as do those which we see about us. Let none be robbed of the hope of heaven by the theosophical mysticism which is sweeping the world to-day.

2. Throughout the Scriptures the Lord represents Himself as one before whose face and bodily presence the redeemed sinner in immortal flesh may one day come. The fact that God is Spirit in no way suggests the spiritualistic idea of an all-pervading personality or influence with no special place where His bodily presence may be approached by spiritual beings. Here is a view of the throne of heaven wholly in accord with scenes presented in Holy Writ: "I saw a throne, and on it sat the Father and the Son. I gazed on Jesus' countenance and admired His lovely person. The Father's person I could not behold, for a cloud of glorious light covered Him. I asked Jesus if His Father had a form like Himself. He said He had, but I could not behold it, for, said He, if you should once behold the glory of His person, you would cease to exist." — Early Writings, p. 45.

3. "In heaven the semblance of a rainbow encircles the throne, and overarches the head of Christ. The prophet says, 'As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about [the throne]. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.' The Revelator declares, 'Behold, a throne was set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. . . . There was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.' When man by his great wickedness invites the divine judgments, the Saviour, interceding with the Father in his behalf, points to the bow in the clouds, to the rainbow around the throne and above His own head, as a token of the mercy of God toward the repentant sinner. With the assurances given to Noah concerning the flood, God Himself has linked one of the most precious promises of His grace. . . . Isa. 54:9, 10." — Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 107.

4. These elders are plainly redeemed men, who once lived on earth. Many sleeping saints arose with Christ (Matt. 27:52, 53), and as He ascended on high He led a multitude of captives (Eph. 4:8, margin), first-fruits and pledges of His victory over the grave and of the coming resurrection of all the righteous dead. In Solomon's temple note that the priests served in courses of twenty-four. 1 Chron. 24:3, 4.

5. By His death and His victory over sin, Jesus had demonstrated His power to make manifest to the sons of men the mystery of the salvation of God, and as head of the church redeemed, it was His to reveal to the prophet events of the future which He desired His servants to understand.
