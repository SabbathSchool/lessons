### Notes

1. The seven trumpets deal with the wars of nations; the first four with the downfall of the western division of the Roman Empire. The division of Rome, as prophesied by Daniel, was to be brought about amidst war and tumult. The four attacks that really shattered the Western Empire are here covered.

2. As though to reassure the saints who were to witness the coming calamities of war, the Lord shows how surely the prayers of the saints on earth came up before His throne. "The incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the merits and intercession of Christ." — Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 353. This picture must ever comfort believers who will pass through the last struggle of the nations, when war and tumult is to fill the earth. Verse 5 seems to pass to the close of the heavenly ministry and the final desolation of the earth.

3. "Hail and fire mingled with blood" suggests war from the north, with fire and sword. The Goths fell upon Rome from the icy north like a hailstorm, A. D. 395-419, particularly under Alaric. Compare these significant phrases from the historian Gibbon's account with the language of the prophet: "They [the Goths] deserted their farms at the first sound of the trumpet." "Armies . . . issuing from the frozen regions of the north." "The consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the Rhine over the greater part of seventeen provinces of Gaul." "His [the poet Claudian] trees, his old contemporary trees, must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country." The text says, "The third part of trees." The phrase, "the third part," often repeated in this series, evidently has reference to the division of the empire into three parts, effected in Constantine's day, — the eastern, with Constantinople the capital: the western, including Britain, Gaul (France), and Spain; and the central division, having the city of Rome as capital.

4. The next crushing attack was from the burning regions of the south, by the Vandals, A. D. 428-476. The sea is the scene of conflict. Under Genseric, "Monarch of the sea," naval attacks were made upon the empire, aptly described in the symbol of the burning mountain cast into the sea. Twice he burned the entire Roman fleet. Carthage, in northern Africa, was his capital. "He beheld," says Gibbon, "the final extinction of the Empire of the West."

5. Invasion of the Huns under Atilla, whose forces struck most heavily in the regions in which the main river systems of the empire have their fountain head. His career in Western Rome was brief, as a blazing meteor, A. D. 455-453. Atilla gloried in the titles, "The Scourge of God," "The Terror of the World," and bitter as wormwood was the cup of affliction pressed to the lips of the inhabitants of the desolated regions.

6. "In the political firmament of the ancient world, while under the reign of imperial Rome, the emperorship, the consulate, and the senate shone like the sun, the moon, and the stars." — Keith. After the conquest of Italy (A. D. 476), Odoacer, king of the Heruli, abolished the office and title of emperor in Western Rome, and in the course of history soon following, the consulship (in 545) and senate (542) were also set aside, "till Rome was without an emperor, a consul, or a senate." The original Roman Empire had been divided. The ancient seat of empire, the city of Rome, was henceforth to enthrone a pope instead of a Caesar. In coming up he had schemed the overthrow of three of the ten new nations, the Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths, and in A. D. 538 the political supremacy of the Papacy was established, with seven nations in the territory of Western Rome, represented in the present-day nations of western Europe. Constantinople was the sole imperial city. And in the events of the next two trumpets the scene is transferred to the East.
