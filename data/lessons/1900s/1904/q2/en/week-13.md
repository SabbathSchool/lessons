### Notes

1. Before entering upon details of events to come under the sounding of the seventh trumpet, the prophet's view is first of all directed to the triumph when Christ's ministry for sin is finished.

2. The study of the sanctuary question shows that the investigative judgment that precedes the coming of the Lord is the cleansing of the sanctuary, the finishing of Christ's ministry in the second apartment of the heavenly temple. The opening of this apartment, where the ark of the testament is, and the opening of the judgment, are one and the same events.
