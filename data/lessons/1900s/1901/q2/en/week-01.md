## Notes

1. "He, the Sin-bearer, endures the wrath of divine justice, and for thy sake becomes sin itself." — Desire of Ages, p. 755. "Into the world where Satan claimed dominion, God permitted His Son to come, a helpless babe, subject to the weakness of humanity. He permitted Him to meet life's peril in common with every human soul, to fight the battle as every child of humanity must fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal loss." — p. 49.

2. "The heart of the human father yearns over his son. He looks into the face of his little child, and trembles at the thought of life's peril. He longs to shield his dear one from Satan's power, to hold him back from temptation and conflict. To meet a bitterer conflict and a more fearful risk, God gave His only-begotten Son, that the path of life might be made sure for our little ones." — Id., p. 49.

3. "This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have remained at the Father's side... But He chose to give back the scepter into His Father's hands, and to step down from the throne of the universe, that He might bring light to the benighted and life to the perishing." — Id., p. 21.

4. "If we had to bear anything which Jesus did not endure, then upon this point Satan would represent the power of God as insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus was in all points tempted like as we are. He endured every trial to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf no power that is not freely offered to us." — Id., p. 22.

5. "The blood-drops of agony that from His wounded temples flowed down His face and beard, were the pledge of His anointing with the oil of gladness as our great high priest." — Id., p. 734.

6. Having taken man's place, Jesus was treated as sinful man deserved. Spurrell's Translation of 2 Sam. 7:14 reads: "Even in His suffering for iniquity, I will chasten Him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men." By this treatment He was earning the right to become man's advocate. See "Desire of Ages," pp. 25, 744. These experiences of suffering were to fit Him to be a merciful High Priest. Heb. 5:1, 2; 2:17; "Desire of Ages," p. 742; Heb. 7:28, margin.
