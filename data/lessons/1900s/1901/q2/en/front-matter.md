# SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSONS ON The Sanctuary FOR SENIOR CLASSES

## SECOND QUARTER, 1901

It has been some time since our schools studied the subject of the sanctuary, and we are sure that many will esteem it a great privilege to have our Sabbath-school lessons on this important theme once more.

In the last lesson of the last quarter we were exhorted to remember the law of Moses which the Lord commanded "for all Israel." Mal. 4:4. If we form a part of the "Israel of God" (Gal. 6:16), we will study and remember that law which was a "shadow of good things to come" (Heb. 10:1), that we may understand the position and work of our High Priest in "the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man" (Heb. 8:1, 2). The things which "were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope" (Rom. 15:4).

No one should get the idea that the subject of the sanctuary has been treated exhaustively in these lessons, for such is not the case. The different phases of the subject are just touched upon, therefore we urge upon all, the earnest, prayerful study of this great question, simply regarding the lessons as a guide in suggesting an orderly arrangement of its different phases. This study should prove a great blessing to all our people.

The subscription edition of "Desire of Ages" is used for reference. Those who have only the trade edition of this work will find the quotations in the following chapters: Chapter 1, "God with Us;" chapter 4, "Unto You a Saviour;" chapter 11, "The Baptism;" chapter 27, "Thou Canst Make Me Clean;" chapter 71, "A Servant of Servants;" chapter 77, "In Pilate's Judgment Hall;" chapter 78, "Calvary." These chapters may all be read with profit while studying the lessons, also the following chapters in "Patriarchs and Prophets:" Chapter 5, "Cain and Abel Tested;" chapter 30, "The Tabernacle and Its Services."

The following helps are recommended to our schools while studying this series of lessons: "Christ Our Advocate," No. 128 of the "Bible Students' Library," price 10 cents; "Looking unto Jesus," in cloth, price $1.00, and the same in paper, as No. 5 of the "Berean Library," price 25 cents.

We are glad that our schools will have these excellent helps in the study of the lessons, in addition to some very instructive articles on this important subject that have appeared in our periodicals in recent years, and to others that will be published in the "Signs of the Times," beginning about April 1. Above all, and more important than all, we urge upon every student the necessity of carefully studying the Scriptures, that he may be taught by the great Teacher, and know for himself the truth as it is in Jesus. The texts enclosed in parenthesis are suggested as side lights to be studied with the lessons.

*The surplus donations for the present quarter will be used in the most needy foreign fields.*
