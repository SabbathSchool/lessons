## NOTES

1. "O priests." This chapter is especially addressed to priests; but because of this no one need give it away. God designs that His people—all of them—should be priests unto the world. "And He made us to be a kingdom, to be priests unto His God and Father." Rev. 1:6, R. V. "But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, . . . that ye may show forth the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2:9, R. V. And this was God's design with Israel of old. "And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests." Ex. 19:6. All God's children should be priests to the world, ministering the grace and knowledge of God to the needy. And the world has a right to expect this of them.

2. "Abomination is committed." The Lord counts Himself as husband to His people. See Jeremiah 3, especially verse 14; Rom. 7:4. He takes poor humanity in their vileness, gives them His own royal name, and His glorious robes of righteousness. When those who have been thus honored depart from Him and unite with another, they are as truly committing adultery as is a woman who leaves her own lawful husband to become the wife of another. When the church unites with the state, she is profaning God's holiness and committing abomination.

3. "Thy companion." God did not give man a wife, to satisfy his lust, nor to be his slave or servant, nor to occupy an inferior position, even though a different one. The original expression is "a help, meet for him," one fitted to be his companion in a noble service for God and humanity. Husband and wife are to be one, but neither he nor she is to be the one. Both are to blend in one purpose, in one life, but neither to be the slave of the other.
