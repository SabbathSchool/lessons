# LESSON 1 - DEBTORS TO DO THE WHOLE LAW

January 5, 1901

(Gal. 4:30, 31; 5:1-8, R. V.)

"What saith the Scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son; for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman. Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman. With freedom did Christ set us free; stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love. Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? This persuasion came not of Him that calleth you."

DONATIONS THIS QUARTER GO FOR WORK IN THE MOST NEEDY FIELDS.

Remember that this whole epistle is devoted to showing the difference between the flesh and the Spirit. The trouble with the Galatian brethren was that, having begun in the Spirit, they were seeking perfection through the flesh. See chapter 3:3. In the fourth chapter we have a sharp contrast between the flesh and the Spirit. The flesh is bondage, the Spirit is freedom. If we have been baptized into Christ, we have put on Christ, and Christ through the Spirit abides in us. "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you." Rom. 8:9. "So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free;" for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." 2 Cor. 3:17. Not to Sinai, but to Mount Zion, do we come for life. See Heb. 12:18-24.

## NOTES

1. "If ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing." "Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law." These two statements, together with a remembrance of what circumcision signified, and also the controversy that was being waged in the churches by the false brethren, make the case very clear. Why were some now turning to circumcision? Because false brethren had taught them "except ye be circumcised, ye can not be saved." It was for justification, salvation. Circumcision was a sign of righteousness, of the keeping of the law, but only of righteousness by faith. Rom. 4:11. Those, therefore, who were trusting to circumcision for justification, were seeking righteousness by their own works of the law.

2. "Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision." That is, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any power. Neither condition can help any person to gain righteousness. Circumcision was never designed as a help; it was never intimated by the Lord that it had any power. It was given merely as a sign of the righteousness already possessed through Christ. What every person needs is power, but neither circumcision nor anything else, except Christ, can give that. The cross of Christ is the power of God, and in that we get the righteousness of God.

3. The original purpose of God in giving the sign of circumcision, had been lost sight of, and the thing had been wholly perverted. It was given to Abraham as a sign of the righteousness which he already had, through faith, after he had made the vain attempt to fulfill the promises of God by his own flesh. It was to be a sign, a reminder, that "the flesh profiteth nothing." Therefore in a warning against those who are of the circumcision—who trust in their own works for salvation—we read, "For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh." Phil. 3:3.

4. Circumcision was given as a sign of righteousness, a sign of perfect commandment-keeping. It is evident, therefore, that wherever there was circumcision, we should expect to find the law fully kept, and whoever was circumcised in order to secure righteousness, thereby pledged himself to do the whole law, to make himself wholly righteous through the flesh. But this is an impossibility, for righteousness can be obtained in no other way than through faith in Christ—faith which receives and appropriates the life of Christ. Therefore the man who undertakes to make himself righteous is in debt to the law; he is debtor to do the whole law. He has assumed obligations which he can never fill, and he is everlastingly a debtor. He owes perfect righteousness, and has not the first thing wherewith to pay. It is a terrible condition in which to be. Read Rom. 8:3-7. To seek righteousness through the flesh is to seek righteousness by that which is diametrically opposed to righteousness. It is like seeking reconciliation with God by making a league with the devil. Of course every man on earth is in debt to the law, in that nobody has fulfilled the law's just demands; but when one has acknowledged the claims of the law, and has set himself to discharge the obligation, the condition is emphasized.

5. The hope of righteousness is the inheritance. "The promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith." Rom. 4:13. See also Gal. 3:18; 2 Peter 3:13. It is through the Spirit that we wait for this; for the Spirit is "the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession." Eph. 1:14. Only through the Spirit of God can righteousness be obtained. "The righteousness of the law" is fulfilled only in those "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:4.

6. "Who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?" What is truth? "Thy Word is truth." John 17:17. Christ is the Word, and He is "the Truth." John 14:6. Therefore, only in Him is there sanctification. John 17:17, 19; 1 Cor. 1:30. In Him dwells the law in perfection. Ps. 40:8. He sets the captive soul at liberty, a liberty which is found only in seeking God's precepts. Ps. 119:45. In Him is "the perfect law of liberty." The freedom which Christ the Truth gives, is freedom from sin, from disobedience to God's holy, righteous, and good law. "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free."
