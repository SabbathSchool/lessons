# POWER FOR WITNESSING

Our very existence as a denomination depends upon a second and continuous Pentecost, therefore a book which makes the reception of the Holy Spirit easily understood is one of the most important works we can publish or read.

Such a book is "Power for Witnessing."

Its two hundred and one pages are filled with such experiences and instruction as you will read with profit and delight, and which even your unconverted friend will appreciate. Possibly it may result in his conversion. Try it.
