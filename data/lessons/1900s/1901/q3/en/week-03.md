### NOTES

1. The student will notice that the chronology of Archbishop Usher, which is used in the margin of our Bibles, places the vision of Daniel 8 in 553 B.C., and the vision of Daniel 9 in 538 B.C., 15 years apart. It was formerly supposed that the Belshazzar of Dan. 8:1 and of Daniel 5 was the Nabonadius of secular history, whose reign began in 555 B.C. Later researches have proved, however, that Belshazzar was the son of Nabonadius, and that his reign dated from 543 B.C. This would make his third year 538 B.C., the same year he was overthrown and succeeded by Darius. Thus the visions of the two chapters would be in the same year, and not 15 years apart. See "Christ Our Advocate," pp. 48, 49.
