# LESSON 8: TIME OF THE INVESTIGATIVE JUDGMENT

### August 24, 1901

The subject of the time of judgment is so important that we trust the student will bear with us if in this lesson we go again over some of the familiar texts which have been used in previous lessons, for we seek to place them in a new connection, in order that they may the more readily be seen in all their bearings.

2. To whom will this appointed day be revealed? Who will have no need for fear in that day? Eccl. 8:5; John 5:24.

3. What does the wicked man know about the judgment? How does this little knowledge make him feel? What does he not know? Eccl. 8:6, 7; Dan. 12:10.

### NOTES

1. None but those who, by confession, had transferred their sins to the sanctuary, could possibly come into the work of the cleansing of the sanctuary. So in the antitype, the work of Christ in cleansing the heavenly sanctuary is alone for those whose names have been recorded in the Lamb's book of life.
