## Testimonies on Sabbath-School Work

While this little work has had a large circulation, there are yet thousands of Sabbath-school workers who are unsupplied. Notice the plans outlined for its use in the "Talk with Sabbath-school Workers," elsewhere in this pamphlet.

## Manual for Canvassers

This is an especially timely publication, containing, as it does, a compilation of all the testimonies relating to the circulation of our publications. Equally valuable to all classes of workers.

## Testimony Volume 6

The writer of this notice has just had the opportunity of reading this new volume of Testimonies, and the thought came to him again and again, "How can any of our people afford to be without it in these closing days, when Satan has so many traps laid for our feet?"

Many of the messages which have heretofore been confined to typewritten copies in the hands of a few, are here given for the benefit of all who can read.

The book is divided into sections, such as Camp-meeting Work, Educational Work, Medical Missionary Work, Canvassing Work, and Calls to Service.

| ------- | ----------- |
| Pages | 499 pages |
| Price in cloth | $1.00 |
| Price in limp leather | $1.50 |
| Price in library leather | $1.50 |

## A Dollar Pocket Bible

We have just purchased a new Oxford Bible for the pocket. Although it contains references, it is only 3⅝ x 5⅜ inches in size and weighs but 9¾ ounces. The type is what is known as "Brilliant."

It is the best pocket Bible for $1.00 we have ever seen, and if you are not entirely satisfied, you may return the book and your money will be refunded.

## The House We Live In

When Summer's Sunny Days draw us near to Nature's heart, what can be more appropriate than a study of God's greatest work, the human body? A pleasing story, pleasantly told, is

**The House We Live In**

It uses no scientific terms, is simple to understand, and will hold the attention of children of all ages, from six to sixty. In a happy, anecdotal way, it imparts a knowledge of the human "House," and at the same time teaches correct principles of living. Buy it for your child. You will read it yourself.

## "None to Speak of"

"How many potatoes did you raise this year?" asked one farmer of another. "None to speak of," is the reply. He does not speak of his potato crop because he has none to speak of. And this is the reason why many do not speak of their experience; they have no experience to speak of.

Reader, if you do not have an experience to speak of, get one. If you already have an experience worth speaking of, then speak of it.

The above quotation is from that helpful and practical book

## A Peep into the Future

As an interested reader of the Signs of the Times, I feel anxious to tell you about what you will receive in its pages during the rest of the year. I have had the privilege of looking over a number of manuscripts now ready and others which are only partly written, and a talk with the editor concerning others which are promised.

| Upcoming Content | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Book of Daniel Articles | Written by the editor himself. One of its special aims is to emphasize the fact that the book was written for those who live in the "time of the end." Includes content on the educational advantages of Babylon, with much that is new and of deep interest. |
| Zechariah Articles | By Pastor R. S. Owen, who has long been an able teacher and evangelist. He has undoubtedly studied more into this book than any other man in the denomination, and his application of its message to the last days is full of comfort and good cheer. |
| Child and Nature Study | Series of articles by Professor Griggs will be used in the Home Department. |
| "The Last Thing in the World" | Pastor Geo. E. Fifield has two articles that treat upon Charity, and are full of life and power. No one should miss them. |
| Law of God | Series by E. J. Hibbard |
| Nature of Man | Series from a logical and scientific standpoint, by Prof. J. A. L. Derby |
| Ventilation | Series of articles by Dr. Sanderson |
| Church Development | Series of articles by Dr. David Paulson, on How to Make the Church a Force and Not a Field |
| Additional Content | Helps to the study of the Sabbath-school and Sunday-school lessons, and an inspiring poem on Greed |

Surely the readers of the Signs of the Times have a feast of good things before them during the months that are to come. If you are not a reader, let me suggest that you become one. If you are, would it not be well to see that your friends become readers?
