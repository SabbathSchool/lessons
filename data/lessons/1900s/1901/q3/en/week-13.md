### NOTES

Read "Great Controversy," chap. 42; "Early Writings," pages 151-154.

1. Those only who have "followed" Christ, and who have "continued with" Him in His temptations, are to sit on thrones of judgment. Every temptation we have was Christ's temptation before it could be ours, or He could not give a victory already gained. But how often, instead of "continuing with Him" in the temptation, we deny him, as Peter did. "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation." Only those who have been "saviours" can be judges.

2. "As the features of the countenance are reproduced with unerring accuracy on the polished plate of the artist, so the character is faithfully delineated in the books above."—Great Controversy, page 487. When these books are opened to the righteous, and the counsels of the heart are made manifest, then the saints can judge the world, but not before.

3. The wicked dead being raised at the end of the one thousand years, and the righteous returning to this earth, fully looses Satan.

4. "This [the destruction of the wicked] is not an act of arbitrary power on the part of God. The rejectors of His mercy reap that which they have sown... By a life of rebellion, Satan and all who unite with him place themselves so out of harmony with God that His very presence is to them a consuming fire. The glory of Him who is love will destroy them."—Desire of Ages, pp. 763, 764. "At the second advent of Christ the wicked shall be consumed with the 'spirit of His mouth,' and destroyed 'with the brightness of His coming.' The light of the glory of God, which imparts life to the righteous, will slay the wicked." "To sin, wherever found, our God is a consuming fire. In all who submit to His power, the Spirit of God will consume sin. But if men cling to sin, they become identified with it. Then the glory of God, which destroys sin, must destroy them." Id. pp. 107, 108. And so with the Word of God. To those who obey it, it is food and life, but to the disobedient, a sword of destruction.
