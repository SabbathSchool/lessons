### NOTES

Read "Great Controversy," chapters 40, 41.

1. The voice of God at this time evidently causes the partial resurrection spoken of in these verses. The side texts given with the others show positively that those who took part in His crucifixion will see Him when He comes. Rev. 14:13 would indicate that those who had fallen asleep under the third angel's message would be raised at that time, for all are rewarded according to their works. "All those who have died in the faith of the third angel's message come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with those who have kept His law."—Great Controversy, p. 637. See "Early Writings" ("Spiritual Gifts"), p. 145.

2. "At the voice of God they [the living saints] were glorified; now they are made immortal, and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air."—Great Controversy, p. 645.
