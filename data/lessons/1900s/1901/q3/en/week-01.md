### NOTES

1. There were ordinances of divine service connected with the worldly sanctuary. These are described in Leviticus and Numbers, and briefly summarized in Heb. 9:6, 7. That sanctuary was a figure (verse 9), or pattern (verse 23), of the sanctuary, or true tabernacle, which is in heaven. Heb. 8:1, 2. And the services of the worldly sanctuary were an example or shadow of the services in the heavenly sanctuary. Verses 3-5. The worldly sanctuary and the service of the priests were to teach us by illustration in regard to the heavenly sanctuary and the work of our great High Priest.

2. "The daily service consisted of the morning and evening burnt-offering, the offering of sweet incense on the golden altar, and the special offerings for individual sins. And there were also offerings for sabbaths, new moons, and special feasts."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 352.

3. "The repentant sinner brought his offering to the door of the tabernacle, and placing his hand upon the victim's head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to the innocent sacrifice. By his own hand the animal was then slain, and the blood was carried by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the vail, behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary. In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy place, but the flesh was then to be eaten by the priest... Lev. 10:17. Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the penitent to the sanctuary. Such was the work that went on day by day throughout the year. The sins of Israel being thus transferred to the sanctuary, the holy places were defiled."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 332. So the ordinances of divine service connected with the heavenly sanctuary are for the purpose of separating the sinner from his sins. "By faith the sins of the repentant are placed upon Christ and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary."
