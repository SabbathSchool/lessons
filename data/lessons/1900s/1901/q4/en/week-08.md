1. In this scripture, how many comparisons are made? What are they? What was hid? Where? Until what resulted? Was the leaven naturally in the meal? What practical lesson do you get from this fact? At the beginning which was the greater in bulk - the leaven or the meal? Finally, what did all become? What does this show of the efficiency of the "hidden life"?
2. What is the second comparison? What will the man do who actually finds it? Does he reluctantly part with his former possessions in order to obtain the "hid treasure"? What are you willing to give up for heaven?
3. What is the third comparison? When we are the "merchantman," who is the "Pearl"? When Christ is the "Merchantman," who is the "pearl"? Mal. 3:17. What price did He pay for us? Give scripture proof. Does the merchantman regret to part with all his former possessions in order to procure the "pearl of great price"?
4. What is the fourth comparison? What is gathered in the net? What is done with the bad? With the good? In reference to the kingdom, when does He say He will "sever the wicked from among the just"? Then how long will bad fish be found in the gospel net? How does this agree with the parable of the tares? In this case, who separates the bad from the good? Where were the tares cast? Where are these cast?
5. To close this series of parables, what question did Jesus ask? What did they answer? Then what further instruction came? If we are among the "scribes instructed unto the kingdom of heaven," what may we do?

## NOTES

The leaven - something wholly from without - must be put into the meal before the desired change can be wrought in it.

As the leaven, when mingled with the meal, works from within outward, so it is by the renewing of the heart that the grace of God works to transform the life.

The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whole mass under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works secretly, silently, steadily, to transform the soul,

Man is not endowed with new faculties, but the faculties he has are sanctified.

The leaven of truth will not produce the spirit of rivalry, the love of ambition, the desire to be first.

The grace of Christ is to control the temper and the voice.
