2. Give the reply of the Master.
3. Had He taught this same prayer before? Where?
4. In the prayer, what endearing name are we permitted to use? By the very utterance of the name, what do we admit ourselves to be? How does the beloved John show his appreciation of this relationship with the Holy One? 1 John 3:1, 2. To whom do these words have more than an empty sound?
5. What incident is related to impress the Lord's prayer? At what hour is the request made for bread? Where is the one of whom the favor is asked? Why does he at first object? What will persuade him to rise and give the bread? How much will he give?
6. Why are some prayers never granted? James 4:3.
7. In the parable, for whose benefit was the urgent request made?
8. For whom were Jesus' earnest prayers offered? John 17:9-11, 15-26; see note. What practical lesson may we learn from this fact?

10. Turning from the sleeping friend to an earthly father, what precious truths are taught in reference to prayer? Why does even this fail to equal our heavenly Father's willingness to give? How only may we preserve the capacity for receiving of God? See note.
11. Does prayer work any change in God? See note.
12. Have God's promises any conditions? What are they? John 14:13-15.

## NOTES

Not for Himself, but for others, He lived and thought and prayed. From hours spent with God He came forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Here Christ represents the petitioner as asking that he may give again.

A selfish man will grant an urgent request, in order to rid himself of one who disturbs his rest. But God delights to give.

Our prayers are not to be a selfish asking, merely for our own benefit. We are to ask that we may give.

The capacity for receiving is preserved only by imparting. We can not continue to receive heavenly treasure without communicating to those around us.

Prayer is not to work any change in God; it is to bring us into harmony with God. When we make a request of Him, He may see that it is necessary for us to search our hearts and repent of sin. Therefore He takes us through test and trial, He brings us through humiliation, that we may see what hinders the working of His Holy Spirit through us.

God does not say, Ask once and you shall receive. He bids us ask, unwearyingly persist in prayer. The persistent asking brings the petitioner into a more earnest attitude, and gives him an increased desire to receive the things for which he asks.

The practice of telling our difficulties to others only makes us weak, and brings no strength to them.
