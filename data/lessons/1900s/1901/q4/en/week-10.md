## NOTES

Whoever trusts in himself that he is righteous, will despise others.

The sense of need, the recognition of our poverty and sin, is the very first condition of acceptance with God.

Those whom heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to parade their own goodness.

Great as is the shame and degradation through sin, even greater will be the honor and exaltation through redeeming love. To human beings striving for conformity to the divine image there is imparted an outlay of heaven's treasure, an excellency of power, that will place them higher even than the angels who have never fallen.
