## Notes.

1. Jesus does not force the Gospel upon any. The Gadarenes being indifferent to the Gospel, He left them and went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, near Capernaum. Here the people were more willing to hear His words. But the man whom He had healed He left as a witness of His work in Gadara.

2. When Jesus was on earth, none were ever turned away empty who came and asked help of Him. He deeply sympathized with this father in his trouble, and responded at once to his request for help. "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." Heb. 13:8. A. R. V. Jesus is just as willing today to help those who are in trouble and who call upon Him in faith, as when He walked the shores of the Galilee.

3. "It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him [Jesus] as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith, as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power."—"Desire of Ages," page 347.

4. The American Revised Version reads, "And straightway Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned Him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched My garments?" Though she was unnoticed by men, the Saviour recognized the touch of faith from this poor woman. It is even so now. The touch of faith still brings healing from disease, healing from sin.

5. "Talitha Cumi.— This is mere Syriac, the proper translation of which the evangelist has given."— Dr. Adam Clarke.

6. Note the power which is in the words of Christ. "Such is the Gospel call to those who are by nature dead in trespasses and sins, and can no more rise from that death by their own power, than this child; and yet the command, Awake, and arise from the dead, is neither vain nor in vain; there follows immediately, Christ shall give thee light."—Henry and Scott.

7. The Lord here gives us an example of how He desires to cooperate with us in helping others. He raised the girl to life; this was something the parents could not do. He might have given her food also, but this He asked them to do.
