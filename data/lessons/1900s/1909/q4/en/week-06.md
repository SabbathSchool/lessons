## Notes.

1. Having seen His wonderful miracle, the people were following Jesus hoping to receive some temporal benefit. But Jesus sought to turn their minds away from the perishing things of life by pointing them to the true bread, which if they would eat, they would live forever.

2. "They had already seen the miracle of the five loaves, and did not believe; and it was impossible for them to see anything more descriptive of unlimited power and goodness. Even miracles themselves are lost on persons whose hearts are fixed on the perishing things of the world, and whose minds are filled with prejudice against the truth. Their argument seemed to run thus: Thou hast, we grant, fed five thousand men with five loaves and two small fishes; but what is this in comparison with what Moses did in the desert, who for forty years fed more than a million persons with bread from heaven? Do something like this, and then we will believe on Thee, as we have believed on Moses."— Dr. Adam Clarke.

3. "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins, and that we are complete in Him."—"Desire of Ages," page 389.

4. "The words I have spoken." John 6:63, A. R. V. Not some new point of doctrine I am about to reveal, but the words I have just spoken concerning My being the living bread, they are eternal life. There is eternal life abiding in these words for us at this time.

5. "By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples were still further alienated from Jesus. They were greatly displeased; and wishing to wound the Saviour and gratify the malice of the Pharisees, they turned their backs upon Him, and left Him with disdain. They had made their choice,— had taken the form without the Spirit, the husk without the kernel. Their decision was never afterward reversed; for they walked no more with Jesus."—"Desire of Ages," page 393.
