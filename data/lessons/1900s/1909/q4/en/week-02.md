## Notes.

1. The limit of what God can do for us is simply the limit of our faith. "And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth." Mark 9:23. A. R. V.

2. "He [Jesus] wished to be saved from all unnecessary publicity, that He might the more effectually prosecute His ministry, and so avoid unnecessarily awakening the opposition of the Jews; but such a light could not be hid."—Dr. Adam Clarke.

3. "Light comes to the soul through God's word, through His servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when one ray of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing of the spiritual perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less clearly discerned. So the darkness increases, until it is night in the soul. Thus it had been with these Jewish leaders. They were convinced that a divine power attended Christ, but in order to resist the truth, they attributed the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan. In doing this they deliberately chose deception; they yielded themselves to Satan, and henceforth they were controlled by his power."—"Desire of Ages," page 322.

4. "Jesus had now been among the people long enough to see their wretched condition spiritually, to detect their misdirected yearnings, and their dissatisfaction with the religious instruction they were receiving, and also to discover the entire unfitness of their teachers for the work of instruction and saving them. They were like sheep, incapable of caring for themselves, but capable of being turned and led into right ways. But who should do all this? An extensive harvest waited to be garnered, but who shall do the work? Very few were able to engage in it. The Lord of the harvest alone could raise up and send forth the needed laborers."—Dr. Adam Clarke.

Now, as then, the people are without a shepherd, and the very last hours of probation are drawing near. The harvest of the earth is nearly ripe, and is soon to be gathered. In a special sense should the people of the Lord earnestly pray at this time that the Lord of the harvest will raise up laborers and send them forth into the field to give the last call of salvation.

5. "Peace, among the Hebrews, had a very extensive meaning — it comprehended all blessings, spiritual and temporal. To wish peace to a family, in the name and by the authority of Christ, was in effect a positive promise, on the Lord's side, of all the good implied in the wish. This was paying largely even beforehand. If the house be worthy — if that family shall be found to be proper for a preacher to lodge in, and the master ready to embrace the message of salvation, your peace, the blessings you have prayed for, shall come upon the family; God will prosper them in their bodies, souls, and substance."— Dr. Adam Clarke.
