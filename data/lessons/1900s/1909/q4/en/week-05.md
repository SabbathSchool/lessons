## Notes.

1. The "desert place" to which Jesus retired for rest was not a barren, desolate region. Matthew tells us there was grass there (Chap. 14:19), John says there was much grass (Chap. 6:10), and Mark says that the grass was green (Chap. 6:39). They went to a quiet, sparsely populated region to be away from the people, in order that they might find needed rest.

2. The Saviour had been performing miracles throughout the day. His question was doubtless intended to try Philip's faith, and to see whether he and the other disciples had paid proper attention to the miracles which they had already witnessed, and to direct their attention in a special manner to the great miracle He was about to perform.

3. Five loaves and two fishes seemed but little. Philip said, "What are they among so many?" But Jesus said, "Bring them hither to Me." Matt. 14:18. He was able to feed the multitude with the little they had. We may learn a lesson from this. Our talents may be meager, but if we bring them to Jesus He can use them, and multiply bread for the hungry multitude who are perishing for the bread of life.

"Gather up the fragments that remain." Though able to create bread by a word, Jesus taught them a striking lesson in carefulness and economy.

4. "The Jews had often suffered by famine in those times in which their enemies were permitted to prevail over them; but finding that Jesus had such power as to multiply a few loaves to feed thousands, they took it for granted that while He was at their head no evil could possibly happen to them, and therefore were determined immediately to proclaim Him king. Our Lord perceiving this, either by some words which they had dropped or by His penetration of their hearts, retired before the project had been fully formed, or could be put into execution."—Dr. Adam Clarke.

5. The life of Jesus was crowded with labor and responsibility as no other life has ever been; yet He took time to pray. Read Mark 1:35; Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12. "In Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of infinite pity. As a man He supplicated the throne of God, till His humanity was charged with a heavenly current that should connect humanity with Divinity. Through continual communion He received life from God, that He might impart life to the world. His experience is to be ours."—"Desire of Ages," page 363.

6. Jesus came to His disciples "in the fourth watch of the night." The fourth watch began at 3 A.M.

7. "It is I; be not afraid." It is thus that Jesus ever seeks to comfort those who are buffeted with the storms of this life. To every troubled heart He says, "I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."

8. Notice Peter's words, "If it be Thou." They express doubt. Jesus had just said He was present, but Peter could not understand how He could be there, or how He could walk on the water. But "if it be Thou," if You are really here, Lord, prove it; let me also walk on the water. To anxious, doubting Peter the Lord gave the required evidence.

9. So long as Peter kept his eyes on the Saviour, he walked on the water. But when he began looking at the other disciples, and on his surroundings, he began to sink. It is ever so in our experience.

10. The disciples had forgotten the miracle of the loaves. How quickly we too forget the wonderful providences of God in our behalf, and grope in doubt and unbelief.
