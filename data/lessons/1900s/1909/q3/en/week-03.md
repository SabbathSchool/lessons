## Notes

1. "Corn" is a common English term for grain. It was probably a wheat-field through which Jesus and His disciples were passing. According to the tradition of the Jews the disciples were thrashing grain, and were therefore guilty of sin. "Lawful" means according to law. Through claiming that they did that which was not lawful they were exalting their tradition to an equality with the law of God.

2. The Sabbath was made for man; it is not against him. It is designed of God to be a blessing, not a hardship or a curse. It is neither a burden nor a yoke, but a helpful friend. All this is pledged in the fact that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. In Him and His gifts can be found only light and love and blessing.

3. According to Luke the healing of the man with the withered hand in the synagogue was on "another Sabbath" doubtless not long after the events recorded in the previous lesson.

4. Read the parallel scriptures. According to Matthew they first asked the question, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" Their emphasis was on the fact of the mere work. Jesus puts the question on the true basis, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do evil, to save life, or to kill?" Then by an illustration drawn from their own practise, He shows the emptiness of their zeal. They would help a sheep or an ox in distress, but would suffer a man to die. No wonder that the heart of Jesus was indignant at such inhumanity and disregard of the true nature of God's service. He did not break the Sabbath. It is lawful always to do well on the Sabbath day. It was not a vindictive anger which came to the Master. His soul was grieved at the hardness of their impenitent hearts.

5. Simon was surnamed Peter, sometimes called Simeon, and Cephas. John and James He surnamed Boanerges, meaning "sons of thunder." Matthew is also called Levi. Simon the Canaanite is also called Zelotes, or the Zealot. Thaddeus is also called Judas.
