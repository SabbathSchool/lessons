## Notes

1. "The Sermon on the Mount, though given especially to the disciples, was spoken in the hearing of the multitude."—"Desire of Ages," page 298. Jesus was tempted as all have been to indulge in idle talk, but He ever resisted all such temptations, and when He spoke He taught His hearers. The things of God were paramount in every word and act. What a lesson this should be to those who are looking for His second coming!

2. The poor in spirit are the humble, the penitent, the teachable. "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word." Isa. 66:2. In such hearts Christ sets up His throne, and there He dwells. Isa. 57:15.

3. True meekness comes alone from Christ. "It is the love of self that destroys our peace. While self is all alive, we stand ready continually to guard it from mortification and insult; but when we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall not take neglects or slights to heart. We shall be deaf to reproach, and blind to scorn and insult. . . . The meekness of Christ, manifested in the home, will make the inmates happy; it provokes no quarrel, gives back no angry answer, but soothes the irritated temper, and diffuses a gentleness that is felt by all within its charmed circle."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pages 30, 31.

4. Hunger means much. Men have become so overpowered by it that they have taken human life to relieve it; but thirst is even more intense. Men go insane from thirst, and it is nearly always the case that it is thirst which renders hunger intolerable. Men can live without food for many days, but they can live only a short time without water. These characteristics of our physical needs should teach us the importance of supplying our spiritual sustenance. Does our body need bread? more than this our souls need the bread of life. Does the physical man call for water? infinitely more do we need God's Spirit, the water of life. But if we hunger and thirst, the Great Provider will abundantly supply our need.

5. We are not to wait to exercise mercy till we are asked; we are ever to hold this disposition toward our greatest enemies. As we deal with them who offend us, so God will deal with us. "For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment." James 2:13.

6. There is but one thing which hides God's face from us, and that is sin. Read Isa. 59:1, 2.

7. It is easy to stir up strife, to cause hard feelings among brethren; to peddle gossip. But the true Christian will ever work to heal all differences and alienations between brethren.

8. Notice that the promise to the persecuted is the same as that to the poor and humble.

9. "A man whose heart is stayed upon God is just the same in the hour of his most afflicting trials and most discouraging surroundings, as when he was in prosperity, when the light and favor of God seemed to be upon him. His words, his motives, his actions, may be misrepresented and falsified, but he does not mind it, because he has greater interests at stake."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pages 52, 53.

10. Salt is a preservative, and is so used as a symbol here. So God's church instead of bringing calamity upon the world, preserves the world. Ten good persons in Sodom would have kept it from destruction. When France persecuted the Huguenots, she drove out her best friends. But if the savor, the preserving power of the salt of the earth, be lost, both salt and earth will perish.

11. Jesus is "the light of the world." John 8:12. God's word is a lamp to our feet, and a light to our path. Ps. 119:105. That word wrought into the lives of His children through Christ Jesus makes them the light of the world. How they should prize the sacred responsibility!
