## Note

We present no extended notes to this lesson. In "Christ's Object Lessons" will be found splendid developments of the passages of scripture. These lessons are worthy of double emphasis: 1. Jesus taught that evil and good would continue to the end; 2. that it was not His servants' duty to execute judgment upon sinners; this He had reserved to Himself at the end of the world; 3. that the business of the Christian is to sow the seed of truth; to spread the leaven and life of the kingdom; to lay all upon the altar that we may win the great prize; to teach the truth of God applicable to the times.
