## Notes

1. Frequently we are told in the Scriptures that Jesus prayed, sometimes all night. Surely if He needed to pray, how much more do we. Jesus loved communion with His Father. If we trusted self less and knew God better, we would be much more in prayer. "Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer and the searching of the Scriptures will be overcome by his attacks."—"Great Controversy," page 341.

2. Galilee is the name given to one of the three divisions of Palestine, the other two being Judea and Samaria. "This is the district which of all others was the most honored with the presence of our Saviour. Here He lived entirely until He was thirty years of age; and although, after the commencement of His ministry, He frequently visited other provinces, it was here that He chiefly resided."—"Popular and Critical Encyclopedia."

3. In the account given by Luke, the "beloved physician," it is stated that this man was "full of leprosy." It was indeed a desperate case. But Jesus touched him, thus showing His compassion and love. He spoke, and the word cleansed the poor, helpless, afflicted man. Even so will He cleanse the sinner who will come to Him. "Jesus loves to have us come to Him just as we are, sinful, helpless, dependent. We may come with all our weakness, our folly, our sinfulness, and fall at His feet in penitence. It is His glory to encircle us in the arms of His love and to bind up our wounds, to cleanse us from all impurity."—"Steps to Christ," page 65.

4. "Jesus desired the man to present himself to the temple before any rumors concerning the miracle had reached them [the priests]. Thus an impartial decision could be secured, and the restored leper would be permitted to unite once more with his family and friends."—"Desire of Ages," page 264.

5. When on earth Jesus met with sinners, received sinners, saved sinners. Our only hope lies in that which the scribes and Pharisees criticized, that Jesus still eats and drinks with sinners. Rev. 3:20.

6. The Bridegroom soon left His people and is still away. There is still need of fasting and prayer.

7. The new, undressed, unshrunk cloth, would by shrinking tear the old fabric. The wine bottles were made of the skins of animals. The new bottles, or skins, would expand with the wine. The old were dry and rigid, and would crack, or break, under the fermenting wine. This contains a spiritual lesson for all time. God's message is living. We can not retain the old traditions, errors, and selfishness, and at the same time receive the new life from above.
