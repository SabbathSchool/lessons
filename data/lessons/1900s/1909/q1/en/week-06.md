4. These expressions, "That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow" and "every tongue should confess" are fulfilled when the wicked gather about the New Jerusalem, at the close of the thousand years. Here the coronation of the Son of God takes place in the presence of the assembled universe. The Father presents in panoramic view the history of the great conflict between good and evil, and each beholds just that part in the drama he has acted. "As if entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of the Son of God. They see in His hands the tables of the divine law, the statutes which they have despised and transgressed. They witness the outburst of wonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved: and as the wave of melody sweeps over the multitude without the city, all with one voice exclaim, 'Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty: just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints; and falling prostrate, they worship the Prince of life."â€”"Great Controversy," pp. 668, 669.

### Notes

1. "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ." The exhortation which these words introduce is evidently a conclusion from what has gone before. The idea is that through persecution the Philippians have been brought to understand the consolation there is in Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit. And now, by the strength of that consolation and fellowship, they are exhorted to be of the same mind. Compare chapter 1:27. The word "if" does not imply any doubt about there being consolation in Christ, or fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 1:3-5); but the apostle would make the well-known fact a strong incentive to unity. Since they all receive consolation from Christ, whose sufferings they share, and have the fellowship of the same Spirit, they must be of the same mind.

2. "Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others." Phil. 2:4. The sense of the verse is very forcibly expressed in the Syriac Version, thus: "And let not each be solicitous (only) for himself, but every one also for his neighbor." Compare 1 Cor. 12:25.

3. The true idea of the text is more clearly set forth in the American Revised Version: "Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant." The idea is that while Jesus, having the form of God, had also equality with God, He did not count that position a thing to be grasped or held to, while He saw men going to perdition without hope. He could not enjoy the glory of heaven without trying to save fallen man. This is the perfect example of unselfishness. He desired not simply His own welfare, but that of others; He found His highest joy in contributing to the joy of others. This enables us to understand what Christ means when He says, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." It means that the faithful servant will have the joy that Christ has in seeing the happiness of souls who have been brought to that happiness by means of his self-denial.
