# Lesson 3 - Paul's Desire for the Church

## Phil. 1:1-11

### JANUARY 16, 1909

**GENERAL NOTE**—"In this epistle to the Philippians Paul commends their Christian zeal and firmness under persecution, informs them of his own temporal and spiritual condition, and of the progress of Christianity at Rome, gratefully acknowledges their continued affection to him, and the receipt of their gift by favor of Epaphroditus; exhorts them to unity and to a lowly and unselfish life, like Christ's (Phil. 2:1-8); warns them against Judaizing teachers and the example of worldly men (Phil. 3:1-19). This epistle, written by Paul while a prisoner at Rome, A.D. 62 or 63, is remarkable for its Christian joy and for the warm affection the apostle shows for the Philippian converts (Phil. 4:1). It contains important teaching as to the humiliation and exaltation of Christ (Phil. 2:5-11), and the resurrection of believers (Phil. 3:21). The Philippine Christians are reminded that as believers in Christ they partake of a dignity and privileges far more exalted than those belonging to them as Roman citizens (Acts 16:12), and are exhorted to live worthily of their heavenly citizenship (Phil. 3:20; 1:27)."—"Bible Dictionary," American Tract Society, Art., "Philippians."

### Notes

1. In this epistle Paul associates Timothy with himself. In the salutation of nearly all of Paul's epistles, some one is associated with him. This does not indicate that those mentioned had any share in writing the epistle, but simply that they joined in the greeting to the brethren. The epistle is written by Paul.

From the preceding lessons we have learned of the establishment of the church at Philippi. The epistle to them makes known to us when and why it was written. It was when Paul was a prisoner at Rome. A peculiar bond of sympathy existed between Paul and the Philippian brethren, because they had been partakers in the same afflictions which Paul suffered in bringing the gospel to them (Phil. 1:28-30), and because they alone had attended to his physical necessities (Phil. 4:15). So when they heard that Paul was in prison in Rome, they sent Epaphroditus, a prominent member of the church, with things necessary to Paul's comfort. While there, Epaphroditus had been sick near unto death. See Phil. 4:18; 2:25, 26. It was by him, after his recovery, that Paul sent his letter to the Philippians, which is remarkable for the spirit of love and tenderness that breathes through it.

2. In the Bible, the words "bishop" and "elder" are synonymous. See Titus 1:5-7, where both words are used. The word "bishop" is from a Greek word signifying to look over, to stand guard as a sentinel. It is in the same sense that the word "overseers" is used in Acts 20:28, where we read that Paul told the elders of Ephesus to take heed to the flock over which the Holy Spirit had made them overseers. The idea of being overseers of the flock suggests shepherds; and in 1 Peter 5:1-4 we find that the elders are called under-shepherds, Christ being the Chief Shepherd. An elder who realizes that his duties are those of a shepherd will know that neither harshness nor negligence are to be among his characteristics.

3. "Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." The fact that the good work had been begun by the Lord was the ground of Paul's confidence in this matter. "Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it." See 1 Thess. 5:23, 24. A work that is begun by man, that rests upon human power, will surely come to naught, no matter how good an appearance it presents for a season. Christ is the only sure foundation. He is able to complete everything that He begins; and this thought, coupled with the fact of His willingness, as shown in His beginning the work, should beget the same confidence in all who have given themselves to Him.

4. The word "sincere" means pure, clear, unmixed. The Greek word from which it is translated has the signification of tested by the sun, as the sun shining through a substance is the test of whether or not it is pure, or has an admixture of some foreign substance. A Christian who is sincere, is unalloyed.
