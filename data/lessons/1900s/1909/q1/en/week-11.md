### Note

"For our citizenship is in heaven." A.R.V. This is the proper reading of the first part of Phil. 3:20. The word "citizenship" expresses the exact meaning of the Greek word. The idea is that this present world is not our home. Our citizenship is in heaven, where is our King; there is the city which contains our permanent residence; and we look for our Saviour to take us there according to His promise. Therefore, as stated in Phil. 1:27, "we should live as citizens, worthily."
