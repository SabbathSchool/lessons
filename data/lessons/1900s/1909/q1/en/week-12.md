### Note

The American Revised Version of Ps. 37:8 reads as follows: "Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing."

This text gives the true idea of all the fretting and worry in life. It all tends simply to evil.

"In the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony with God, there was perfect peace. He was never elated by applause, nor dejected by censure or disappointment. Amid the greatest opposition and the most cruel treatment, He was still of good courage."â€”"Desire of Ages," page 330.
