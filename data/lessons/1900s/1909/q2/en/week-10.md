## Notes

1. "Born again," or better, "born from above," as given in the margin. The American Revised Version reads, "Except one be born anew." The new birth from its very inception is of divine origin.

2. "The wind bloweth where it listeth." The A. R. Version, margin, reads, "The Spirit breatheth where it will." Rotherham's translation reads, "The Spirit where it pleases blows." This is the only instance in the New Testament where the word Pneuma is not rendered Spirit. It evidently means Spirit here also. God's Spirit is not under man's direction, nor can man measure its work. It is utterly incomprehensible to the natural man.

3. "Art thou a Master of Israel, and knowest not these things?" Nicodemus, holding the position he did, ought to have fully understood concerning the new birth. "The conversion of the soul through faith in Christ was but dimly comprehended by Nicodemus, who had been accustomed to consider cold formality and rigid services as true religion." — "Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 2, page 131.

4. "The learned Nicodemus had read these pointed prophecies with a clouded mind, but now he began to comprehend their true meaning, and to understand that even a man as just and honorable as himself must experience a new birth through Jesus Christ, as the only condition upon which he could be saved, and secure an entrance into the kingdom of God. ... The scales fell from his eyes, and faith took the place of doubt and uncertainty. Beams of light streamed from the secret interview in the mountain and illuminated the cross of the Saviour." — "Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 2, pages 132, 135.

5. The negative in this wonderful scripture ought to be emphasized. Our blessed Lord did not come to condemn the world, for the world, because of sin, is condemned already. He came to save from the condemnation of sin.

6. "A question arose between them and the Jews as to whether baptism availed to cleanse the soul from sin; they maintained that the baptism of Jesus differed essentially from that of John. Soon they were in dispute with Christ's disciples in regard to the form of words proper to use at baptism, and finally as to the right of the latter to baptize at all." — "Desire of Ages," page 178.

7. "Though John's mission seemed about to close, it was still possible for him to hinder the work of Christ. If he had sympathized with himself, and expressed grief or disappointment at being superceded, he would have sown the seeds of dissension, would have encouraged envy and jealousy, and would seriously have impeded the progress of the Gospel. John had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to humanity, but the touch of divine love had transformed him. He dwelt in an atmosphere uncontaminated with selfishness and ambition, and far above the miasma of jealousy." — Id., page 179.

8. "'He must increase.' His present success is but the beginning of a most glorious and universal spread of righteousness, peace, truth, and good will among men. 'I must decrease.' My baptism and teaching, as pointing out the coming Messiah, must cease; because the Messiah is now come, and has entered publicly on the work of His glorious ministry." — Clarke. "He must increase, but I must decrease," contains a great spiritual lesson which should not be overlooked.
