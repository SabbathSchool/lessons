# Steps to Christ

By Mrs. E. G. White

This little work, by Mrs. E. G. White, presents in a simple and attractive manner, the steps by which the sinner may find Christ and be made complete in Him.

While the book is an excellent guide to inquirers and young converts, it also contains a wealth of counsel and encouragement for those older in the way, who are experiencing difficulties.

The all-pervading spirituality and wholesome counsel blended throughout its pages, cause the book to meet with general acceptance. Once read, it is often re-read and studied as a guidebook in the way of salvation.

Thirteen chapters; 144 pages. Price, paper, 30 cents; cloth, 60 cents; full gilt edges, $1.00.
