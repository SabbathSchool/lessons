## Notes

1. The presence of our Lord at the marriage in Cana, and the work which He did at that place, stamps with divine approval the sacred marriage institution. It shows, too, that proper joyous occasions are right in His sight. This does not mean that He necessarily approved of all which may have been done there, but holy, happy, home occasions He is pleased to honor with His presence.

2. Jesus when on earth was both the Son of God and the Son of Man. This miracle manifested forth the glory, the goodness, the power, with which God clothed His Son, who "emptied Himself" to save humanity. In this Jesus was declaring His Father. John 1:18. His miracles when on earth were to help others, not Himself. Not a single thread of selfishness was seen in His life.

3. "As Jesus entered the temple, He was indignant to find the court of the temple arranged as a cattle-market and a place of general traffic. There were not only stalls for beasts, but there were tables where the priests themselves acted as money-brokers and exchangers. It was customary for each person who attended the Passover to bring a piece of money, which was paid to the priests upon entering the temple. ... Many came from a great distance and could not bring their sacrificial offerings. Under the plea of accommodating such persons, in the outer court were cattle, sheep, doves, and sparrows for sale at exorbitant prices." — "Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 2, pages 115, 116.

4. Unbelief asked, "What sign?" just as though the work of Christ then and there was not sufficient sign of His divinity. There is danger of being so blind to the present evidence of God's work that we shall fail to see any evidence whatever.

5. By comparing Matt. 26:61, 62, we see that false witnesses, in order to secure Jesus' condemnation, perverted the statement, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." They quoted Him in a way that made Him appear to say that He was going to destroy the temple of Herod. Instead of this, He told them to destroy this (His body) and in three days He would rise from the dead.

6. "His disciples remembered." John writes this long after the resurrection of our Lord. Jesus knew that His disciples must pass through great trials, and He was ever laying up evidence for them in and after the sore trials they experienced so that they could look back and see that all the way there were witnesses for Him, and that His words had been fulfilled.
