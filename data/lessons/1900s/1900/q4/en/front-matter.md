> "Then we may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan and that the end is near."

The foregoing is a definite, positive, clear statement, made by the Spirit of the Lord. Observe how clearly it is said that we may "know" when the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan, and when the end is near.

The context of this significant utterance is the following:—

"By the decree enforcing the institution of the Papacy in violation of the law of God, our nation will disconnect herself fully from righteousness. When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to clasp hands with Spiritualism, when, under the influence of this threefold union, our country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Protestant and Republican Government, and shall make provision for the propagation of Papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan, and that the end is near.

"As the approach of the Roman armies was a sign to the disciples of the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so may this apostasy be a sign to us that the limit of God's forbearance is reached, that the measure of our nation's iniquity is full, and that the angel of mercy is about to take her flight, never to return."—Testimony 32, p. 207.

We have observed for years the developments in this country in the way of the enforcement of Sunday laws, but these Sunday laws can never become generally oppressive until the prophecy is fulfilled which tells us that this nation shall speak as a "dragon." (See Rev. 13:11.) The prophecies in Revelation, as well as this statement from the Testimonies, show that the United States is to depart from its principles of Republicanism, as well as its principles of Protestantism; and that awful time being reached, then are we to know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan, and that the end is right upon us.

The seeds of departure from its Protestant principles have already been widely sown through National Reform ideas that have been promulgated. The seeds of apostasy from Republicanism which will lead it to the place where it speaks as a dragon in the enforcement of Sunday laws and other like oppressive measures are being as widely sown; and by these things we may know that the time has even now come for the marvelous working of Satan, and that the end of all things is right at hand.

In view of these things, every power of the mind, and body, and heart should be given to the Lord, that he may use us as His own in the promulgation of His truth in the world, and every agency should be worked to its fullest capacity. It is with these great and impressive thoughts from the Lord's own prophecies in mind, that the publishers of the SIGNS OF THE TIMES are preparing the special issue to be dated November 28, 1900, and entitled "World's Outlook Number." The thrilling events of the present will make this the most valuable number of the SIGNS that has ever been issued. A few of the subjects that will be presented follow:—

**A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE CENTURY:** Social, religious, political.

**PROPHETIC AMERICAN OUTLOOK:** This country in the world's problems, as foretold in Revelation 13.

**PROPHETIC EUROPEAN OUTLOOK:** International condition of the nations; feeling of the masses; socialism, etc.

**CHURCH AND STATE OUTLOOK:** Tendencies everywhere toward closer union, with Sunday the center.

**PROPHETIC PAPAL OUTLOOK:** Wounded in 1798; recovery and rapid development of strength; present power; what the end will be.

**PROFESSED PROTESTANT OUTLOOK:** Principles of the true; departure therefrom, and the sure result.

**MISSIONS OUTLOOK:** The everlasting Gospel to the world.

**THE CHRISTIAN'S OUTLOOK:** Triumph over sin; regenerated earth and people.

But no list of subjects can adequately present to the mind the thrilling themes that will be presented in this important issue of our "pioneer" missionary paper. No pains are being spared to make it the best. It will be a double number, carefully illustrated, with special decorative cover.

It is desired that every Sabbath-school and church of our people shall thoroughly organize by November 1, when these papers will be ready for distribution, to place a copy in every home throughout the land. Let us as one man put our shoulders to the wheel and do the work of the Lord with earnestness in these times, which demand such prompt and energetic action.
