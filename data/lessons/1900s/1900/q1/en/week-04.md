## NOTES

1. The abiding in Christ is being as closely connected with Him as the branch is to the vine, which draws all its life and growth through the vine from its roots. This makes the branch so much a part of the vine as to be of the same nature; and, in fact, it is but an extension of the vine itself. To remain in that connection, the branch must bear only the fruit of the vine, which is the product of the life of the vine. To have such close connection with Christ is to receive life from God through Him, and to bear only that fruit which is the product of His life,â€”in short, to be the extension of Christ in humanity.

2. To abide in Christ, then, is to abide in His love; not simply to accept forgiveness through His love, but to make His love our own, and live in it. This is the transforming power of Christ, which changes life's ambition, and directs the thoughts from a self-center to seek the upbuilding of the distressed and wretched. This is the fruit of the heavenly vine, which its connected branches must certainly bear.

3. How different is a friend from a servant! No servant is made a confident of family secrets; he has not the freedom of the family circle, does not participate in its united joys, and is not consulted in matters of family interest. He is just a servant, nothing more, doing what he is told, regardless of results. But a friend is welcomed in the family circle, is made a bosom companion, and given the place of honor as a guest. Matters of importance are confided to him, and his counsel sought. His is an enjoyable position. How much more so when we are counted friends of the Lord Jesus!
