"Desire of Ages," chapter 73.

## NOTE
Before this time the disciples had asked favors of Jesus in their own names, and for themselves; now everything was to be changed. The Holy Spirit, the representative of Jesus, was to be in them, prompting all their motives. Self was to be relegated to the background. Nothing was to be asked for simply to please self, but Jesus was the One to be pleased. Hence the name of Jesus was to be used, as though the petitioner would ask only for Jesus' sake, that He might receive the coveted blessing to be used in them.
