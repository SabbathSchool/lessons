## Is Religious Liberty a Dead Issue?

The following from the pen of Elder Uriah Smith, which appeared in the Review of Sept. 26, 1899, is right to the point on this question:â€”

"If there is any Third Angel's Message at all, there is a religious issue connected with it; and that issue is whether Church and State shall be united in this country. . . . The prophecy plainly declares that the iniquitous thing will be done here. . . . Until the message, therefore, has done its work, and is closed, this can never become a dead issue or a back number.

"There are, to be sure, a number of periodicals that can be relied upon as stanch defenders of the true principles of religious liberty. . . . Yet there is only one that is devoted, specifically and aggressively, to the work of making known these principles from the standpoint of the prophetic crisis that is before us; and that is the American Sentinel.

"Be not deceived. This issue is not laid upon the shelf. . . . There is a call and field for every power and every agency that will stand for the right. Let the American Sentinel be sustained."

What do you say about it, brethren and sisters? Do you say "Let it be," or "Let it be sustained"? Will you take hold at once and do your best to help in its circulation? NOW is the time for active work. Let us hear from you.
