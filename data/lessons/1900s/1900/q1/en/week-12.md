## NOTES

1. It would seem from John's record that the garments of Christ were divided just enough to give each soldier one part, and that there were made of these but four parts. This suggests the thought that but four soldiers attended His crucifixion. Besides each of these receiving one part of Christ's nether garments, the seamless coat was awarded to the one to whose lot it fell by chance.

2. This was a thin, sour wine, the usual beverage of the Roman soldiers. It was offered to Christ in the moment of His dying thirst as the only drink at hand.
