## NOTES

1. The "common hall," or public praetorium, was the headquarters of the Roman military governor, and was located, in time of peace, in some one of the best buildings of the city, as decided by the choice of the governor.

2. Cyrene was in North Africa, a province of Libya. That part is now known as Tunis. A large colony of Jews had settled there centuries before, and there were large numbers there still. Simon, though a Jew, was recognized as a foreigner on whom they could shift the burden of the exhausted One, whose slow motions were delaying the progress of the impatient guards.

3. This was a bitter, stupefying drug of myrrh (Mark 15:23), but named gall (Matt. 27:34), because of its bitterness. Jesus, however, refused that which would in any way becloud His faculties, even though it might relieve His excessive pain.
