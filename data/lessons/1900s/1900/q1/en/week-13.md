## NOTES

1. Crucifixion was not contemplated under the provisions of the Mosaic law, yet men were sometimes hanged on a tree after death, that by being thus exposed they might be a warning to all beholders, but they were by no means to be left hanging after sunset, lest the land be defiled. Were three corpses to remain on the cross over Sabbath in plain sight of the temple and holy city, great commotion would follow, because of the strict religious scruples of the people, and might result in disaster.

2. It is said that the custom of breaking the legs of crucified culprits just before sunset, in order to comply with the Jewish law, was so that they could not get away after being taken from the cross, inasmuch as they were rarely if ever found to be so soon dead. Mark 15:44.

3. Joseph was a "counselor," which probably means that he was a member of the great council of the Sanhedrin. Luke 23:50, 51. Probably no one but a member of that court would have dared ask such a favor of the procurator, who alone could give permission for the removal of the body. Joseph had secretly believed in Christ for some time, having but one friend to whom he had divulged his feelings, namely, Nicodemus. Together they had decided to brave indignation, and give the Saviour a decent burial.
