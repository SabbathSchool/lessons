## NOTES

1. Sheep's clothing, peaceable professions, have always been characteristic of false prophets. Their mission is either to lull the church to sleep in sin or to lead it away into error. For the former purpose they cry, "Peace, peace" (Jer. 6:13, 14; Eze. 13:10-16), and for the latter, "Lo, here is Christ, or there" (Matt. 24:23-26). We may know them by their fruits, those fruits measured by "the law and the testimony." Isa. 8:20.

2. To call Jesus "Lord" is to say that we are His servants, doing His service, obeying Him. The real test is, therefore, obedience. "Why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" Luke 6:46.

3. "Iniquity" is lawlessness, breaking of law. Let it be noted that the real test of discipleship is obedience to the will of God. Verse 21. It matters not what has been prophesied in Christ's name, what demons cast out, what miracles wrought, if those who do these things are against God's law, they must be banished forever from Him. This is a complement to Matt. 5:17. If God knows us, we have His Spirit and do His law.

4. The words of Christ were not uncertain, equivocal, or hypothetical. He was filled with the Word of God; God's law was in His heart; He spoke authoritatively, from His own fulness. He would have His children so full of that same Word, He would have that law so inwrought into their very lives, that when they speak it would be "as the oracles of God." 1 Peter 4:11. His words only will carry weight.
