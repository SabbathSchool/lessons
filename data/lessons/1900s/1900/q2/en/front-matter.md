2nd QUARTER, 1900                                                      PRICE 5 CENTS

## MOUNT OF BLESSING
### 30 and 60 Cents

On account of there being a newly illustrated edition of "Mount of Blessing" now in preparation, we have decided to close out the limited number of the present edition now on hand at the following rates:—

| Edition | Regular Price | Sale Price |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Cloth, Plain Edges | 75c | 30c |
| Half Calf, Marbled Edges | $1.00 | 60c |

The above prices include prepayment of postage

These books are perfectly new and the reading matter is almost identical with the new third edition.

The Sermon on the Mount, on which this book treats, is the subject of a portion of this quarter's lessons, and we are sure many will avail themselves of this rare chance of getting a most excellent book at about cost of manufacture.

Remember there are only a limited number, therefore order at once

## An Example

"I have been canvassing for 'The Desire of Ages' almost six months and use 'Mount of Blessing' and 'Steps to Christ' as Helps. Have taken over $800 worth of orders.

"I have been using the fact of the International Sunday-School Lessons being on the Life of Christ to good advantage for the past three months.

"I consider it of the greatest importance to push the sale of this grand book now while the opportunity presents itself to do so successfully.
(Signed) H. C. WILCOX,
South Lancaster, Mass."

The above is an example of what many more might do if they would enter the field. Nearly every earnest, determined, consecrated agent who has taken up "The Desire of Ages" has made a success of it.

Full particulars as to how to take advantage of the S. S. Lesson opportunity now presented, sent on application.
