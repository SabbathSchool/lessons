## NOTES

1. "With one accord." This is a condition on which the presence of the Father and Son is guaranteed to the church. The prayer of Christ for the disciples was "that they may be one" even as the Father and Son are one. The Spirit, which would guide them "into all truth," would enable them to keep the commandments of God. Jesus says, "If a man love Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him." By this union the world would know that Jesus Christ had been sent of God, and that God loved them. John 17:22, 23.

2. "Cloven tongues." This was the form in which the Holy Spirit visibly appeared to the waiting disciples, indicating the special endowment which was essential in proclaiming the gospel to the world.

3. It could no longer be truthfully said that the apostles were unlearned men, even from the world's standpoint. They had been about three years under the tutelage of Christ, who had in every contest baffled the wisdom of the learned ones; and now they received the gift of tongues, such as no man possessed or could have acquired in any of the schools of the world. "The Holy Spirit had done for them that which they could not have accomplished for themselves in a lifetime. They could now spread the truth of the Gospel abroad, speaking with accuracy the language of those for whom they were laboring. This miraculous gift was the highest evidence they could present to the world that their commission bore the signet of Heaven."â€”Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 267.

4. The pouring out of the Spirit was the "promise of My Father" and the "power from on high" mentioned in Luke 24:49 and in Acts 1:3. See Acts 2:33.

5. "David is not ascended into heaven." This declaration, together with the statement in verse 29 that "he is both dead and buried," gives us positive proof that the dead lie in the grave until the resurrection. If David were still conscious, he could not be dead. But if it be insisted that he had a dual life, and that only his body died, then the statement that he "is not ascended into the heavens" would class him among the conscious wicked dead, wherever that might be. But such a conclusion is forestalled by "the last words of David," which were spoken by the spirit of prophecy. See 2 Sam. 23:1-7.
