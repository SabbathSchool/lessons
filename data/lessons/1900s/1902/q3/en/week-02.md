# Lesson 2 - CEREMONIALISM LEADS TO BONDAGE

July 12, 1902

Although the Lord had done so much for His people (Isa. 5:3, 4), yet they did not yield the fruits of righteousness (verse 7). Their service was mere formalism (Isa. 29:13); their confidence was placed in that which was merely external (Jer. 7:4), and their ceremonialism became an offense to God (Isa. 1:11-15). Thus what was given as a means of salvation from sin was perverted into a place of protection for sinners (Jer. 7:9-10), and this led to the announcement of the destruction of the temple (verse 14), and the scattering of the people (verse 15). Confidence in the flesh left the people under the power of sin (Jer. 17:5, 6), and this made them the prey of their enemies (Jer. 5:6). The evil which was deferred during the days of Hezekiah (2 Chron. 32:26), began to come in the days of his son. The sin of Manasseh was very great (2 Chron. 33:9), and all messages of reproof were disregarded (verse 10). Then the Lord used other means of dealing with His people (verse 11), which had the desired effect (verse 12), and opened the way for the Lord to work a deliverance (verse 13). The wicked reign of Amon (verses 21-23) was followed by a great reformation under King Josiah (2 Chron. 34:33), but the next king returned to the evil ways of his fathers (2 Kings 23:31, 32), and Jerusalem became tributary to Egypt (verse 33). The people lost their independence, and a foreign king appointed their ruler. 2 Chron. 36:4. A continued course of evil (verse 5) brought upon the people the wrath which was kindled in the days of Hezekiah (2 Chron. 32:25), and Jerusalem came under the power of Babylon (2 Chron. 36:6, 7).
