# Lesson 1 - THE GOSPEL MESSAGE IS FOR ALL THE WORLD

July 5, 1902

The time between the promises to Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3) and the birth of the Messiah is divided into three periods (Matt. 1:17), each one of which is marked off by experiences which are pivotal in the history of Israel. We have already given some study to the promises to Abraham and to David in our previous lessons, and we shall now deal with some of the circumstances which led up to the captivity in Babylon.

Special blessings were given to Israel (Rom. 9:4) that they might minister them to all nations (Ps. 67:1, 2). If they were faithful to their high privilege, they would rule over the nations (Deut. 15:5, 6). Unfaithfulness to their trust would make them subject to the nations. Deut. 28:15, 37. This is the explanation of the varying experiences of victory and defeat in the history of God's people among the nations, and of their captivity in Babylon.

The experience of Hezekiah will illustrate the principle. Brought face to face with death (Isa. 38:1), he turned to God with weeping (verse 3), and the gospel of life was declared to him by the prophet Isaiah (verses 4, 5). The sign of his salvation from death (verses 7, 8) was God's method of arousing Babylon to send to Jerusalem to inquire for the gospel of life (2 Chron. 32:31; Isa. 39:1). But Hezekiah exalted himself instead of proclaiming the gift of God's life to him. Isa. 39:2-4. This failure to improve the opportunity to spread a knowledge of the God who manifests Himself in flesh made communion with Babylon a curse instead of a blessing (2 Chron. 32:25), and was the occasion of a direct prophecy of the captivity (Isa. 39:6, 7).
