## Notes

To those acquainted with the Old Testament Scriptures the basis of the instruction in this parable was perfectly familiar. A fruit tree existed simply for the purpose of bearing fruit, and when it failed repeatedly to do this, it was not to be permitted to draw life out of the earth merely to keep itself alive. This was the gospel of the fruit tree, and it had been frequently interpreted to the people. The cause of barrenness was to be found in sin (Ps. 107:33, 34), while righteousness was the basis of fruitfulness (Ps. 92:12-15), which would continue even "in old age." The truth had been set forth that delight in the law of the Lord would result in bringing forth fruit (Ps. 1:1-3), and the Messiah's work in imparting to His people "the law of the Spirit of life" would make them "trees of righteousness" (Isa. 61:1-3).

The rejection of the Messiah and His work of grace resulted in the loss of the kingdom of God, which was given "to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof." They thus lost the opportunity of giving to the world the gospel of the kingdom.

The tree which did not "cease from yielding fruit" was constantly proclaiming the experience of "the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." Jer. 17:7, 8. In the light of these interpretations, those who heard the parable of the unfruitful tree had no difficulty in making a right application of its meaning. With the further light from the teaching of Jesus (Matt. 7:19; John 15:2-5), we ought to be able to make a close personal application of this lesson (2 Peter 1:5-8), and bring forth "fruit worthy of repentance." Read Luke 13:1-5, which gives the circumstances which led to this parable, and then read Rev. 3:14-19, and note the earnest call to repentance. This parable is present truth.

"There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
