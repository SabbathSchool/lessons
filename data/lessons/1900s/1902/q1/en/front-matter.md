## SUGGESTIONS FOR FAMILY STUDY

### SABBATH
Read carefully the portions of Scripture which form the basis of the next Sabbath's lesson. Study the memory verse, if there be one.

### SUNDAY
Repeat the story of the lesson from memory, and then read it. Study the circumstances under which the parable was spoken. Ask yourself what is the lesson or lessons the parable is designed to teach.

### MONDAY
Read the comments on the lesson in "Christ's Object Lessons." Review the Scripture lesson.

### TUESDAY
Ask the questions on the primary lesson, and on the youth's lesson, and review the memory verse. Study the practical lessons taught by the parable.

### WEDNESDAY
Ask the questions on the senior lesson. Read the notes in the "Lesson Quarterly," also the notes in the "Instructor."

### THURSDAY
Give an outline of the lesson, connecting with it the helpful thoughts in "Christ's Object Lessons."

### FRIDAY
Review all the lessons. Relate personal experiences in which the truths contained in the lesson have been helpful.
