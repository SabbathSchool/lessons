6. What final request is ascribed to the rich man? How was it answered? What is the highest evidence for truth? What will judge every selfish life in the last day? John 12:48.

## Note

The allegory, in which natural objects or people are represented as acting or talking, often in a manner that would be impossible in actual life, was a familiar means of illustration in olden times, and is here used to point the warning against selfish living. Let not the purpose of the allegory be missed by turning the lesson into a discussion of the state of the dead. At most a few references only will be needed in case any are not familiar with the Bible teaching on this subject, as, for instance, man's condition in death (Eccl. 9:5, 6; John 11:11, 14); when the dead will be awakened (Job 14:12; John 5:28, 29); when only the righteous and the wicked will in fact view one another's reward (Rev. 20:5, 7, 10).
