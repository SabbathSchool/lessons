# Lesson 11 — Taking Away the Real Presence

December 13, 1902

The sanctuary and its services constituted a parable of the Messiah. Heb. 9:8, 9, R.V. "The whole worship of ancient Israel was a promise, in figures and symbols, of Christ." Christ Himself associated the temple with His own body. John 2:19-21. "He was the One in whom all the Jewish ceremony and typical service was to find its fulfilment. He stood forth in the place of the temple; all the offices of the church centered in Himself alone." Christ is the eternal priest. Heb. 5:4-6. Christ is the real sacrifice. Heb. 7:26, 27; Eph. 5:2. When Christ was lost out of the sanctuary and its services, then what was an actual provision for a defense against sin became mere ceremonialism, an excuse for sin and an offense to God. Isa. 1:10-18. The continual service of the sanctuary (1 Chron. 16:37) found its fulfilment in Christ. He is a priest "after the order of Melchisedec" (Heb. 5:10), whose priesthood is expressly declared to be a continual priesthood (Heb. 7:1-3). In the type the priesthood passed from one to another in a continual succession (Heb. 7:23), but in the fulfilment of the type Christ is the only priest, "because He continueth ever" (Heb. 7:24). In the type the priests offered continually and repeatedly the same sacrifices, but Christ's one sacrifice is continual. Heb. 10:1, 11, 12. (Note.—In the Greek the same expression is used in verse 12 and translated "forever" as is used in verse 1 and there translated "continually." In Rotherham's translation the expression "for the uninterrupted continuance" is used in both verses.) Thus the continual priesthood and the continual sacrifice of Christ are the assurance of a complete salvation. Heb. 10:7, 24, 25. The typical service had no efficacy in itself. Heb. 10:1, 4. There must be spiritual worship with God in Christ as the center upon which faith must be fastened. Phil. 3:3.

In the Revised Version of the eighth chapter of Daniel the word "burnt-offering" is supplied after the word "continual." This was doubtless done because the expression "the continual burnt-offering" occurs so frequently in the directions concerning the service of the tabernacle. But the ground covered by the word "continual" in the eighth chapter of Daniel is plainly broader than merely one feature of the tabernacle or temple service. It includes the permanent essence of the whole service, that "which can alone make the worship of sinful beings acceptable to God," whether that worship is offered with or without any ritual service, with or without any typical temple and typical sacrifices. See 1 Peter 2:4, 5; Ps. 4:5; 51:16-19. This essential thing in the continual service is a present Christ, "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world," as "the living sacrifice for a fallen world." To offer up such spiritual sacrifices demands such a union between Christ and the believer that the believer himself, in Christ, becomes a priest (Rev. 1:6), he becomes the temple (1 Cor. 3:16), he becomes the offering (Rom. 12:1). This is that union of divinity and humanity which is "the mystery of godliness," whereby the church becomes the body of Christ (Eph. 1:22, 23), and each individual a member (1 Cor. 12:27). It follows, then, that to take away the continual service, or that which is continual, is to have a temple without Christ in it, a priesthood without Christ, a sacrifice without Christ, and a church without Christ. But this changes the worship of God into idolatry, and substitutes paganism for Christianity, while retaining the names and forms of Christianity. And this is just what the little horn, the Papacy, has done.
