# Lesson 4 — Modern Babylon

October 25, 1902

From our study of the vision of the seventh chapter of Daniel, it is evident that the lion stands for Babylon, the bear for Medo-Persia, the leopard for Grecia, the nondescript beast for Rome political, the ten horns for the ten kingdoms into which Rome was divided, and the little horn for Rome ecclesiastical, or the Papacy. It is also evident that the rise and work of the fourth beast and the little horn constitute the leading theme of the vision.

The book of Revelation is the complement of the book of Daniel, and deals wholly with the period of time during which the fourth beast and the little horn are upon the stage of action. In the book of Revelation we may therefore expect to find additional light given, which will assist in the more complete understanding and interpretation of the vision of the seventh chapter of Daniel.

A careful reading of Rev. 13:1-10 makes it clear that the beast there described is closely related to the fourth beast and the little horn of the seventh chapter of Daniel. It has some characteristics of each of the first three beasts. Verse 2. This shows that this power reaches back through the third and second kingdom to the first. It has ten horns. Verse 1. It is a blasphemous power. Verse 5. The same length of time is assigned to it as to the supremacy of the little horn. Verse 5. It carried on a warfare against the saints. Verse 7. By comparing these specifications with those given in the seventh chapter of Daniel, as applying to the fourth beast and the little horn, the conclusion is certainly warranted that the subject of the two prophecies is the same.

The beast of Rev. 17:3 is identical with the beast of Rev. 13:1, and therefore with the fourth beast of the seventh chapter of Daniel. Observe the seven heads, the ten horns, and the names of blasphemy.

By the interpretation given to the woman sitting on the beast (Rev. 17:18) and the interpretation given to the seven heads (verse 9), it is evident that she represents Rome; not political Rome, but the Rome which built itself up and fastened itself upon political Rome. This is ecclesiastical Rome, the Papacy. It is remarkable that this is the only ecclesiastical organization which ever took its name from a city. But the name given to this woman in the prophecy is Babylon. Rev. 17:5. This identifies ecclesiastical Rome, the Papacy, with ancient Babylon, and shows, that the pretended religion of the Papacy is simply paganism, a revival of the sophistical philosophy of the wise men of Babylon, presented under some of the forms and names of Christianity. In the light of this lesson we can see the importance of studying the principles involved in the history of ancient Babylon, for those experiences are being repeated in modern Babylon, the Papacy, and we are called to proclaim the same truth in modern Babylon as was Daniel in ancient Babylon.
