# Lesson 6 â€” The Kingdom of Antichrist

November 8, 1902

The symbol of the little horn finds its fulfilment in a man. Daniel 8:8, 24. This is the "man of sin" (2 Thess. 2:3), the antichrist (2 John 7, R.V.). The distinguishing characteristics of this enemy of God's kingdom are plainly set forth. He does not acknowledge the revelation of the Son of God in our flesh (1 John 4:3); he puts himself (humanity) in the place of God (Divinity) (2 Thess. 2:4); he speaks against God, persecutes His people, and thinks to change His law (Dan. 7:25). It is evident that these scriptures all apply to one and the same system or person. Thus the seventh chapter of Daniel is a prophecy of the rise and work of the little horn, the man of sin, antichrist, who attempts to establish a kingdom with himself as king under the cover of a profession of loyalty to the kingdom of God.

In ancient Babylon there was undisguised opposition to the God of heaven. The temple and worship of Belus were entirely distinct from the temple and worship of God. Dan. 1:2. The creed of Babylon openly denied the very essence of Christianity. Dan. 2:11. The head of modern Babylon seeks to hide the real character of his work by assuming Christian forms and names. 2 Thess. 2:4. While pretending to be the vicegerent of God, he is in reality the vicegerent of "that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan." Compare Rev. 13:2 with Rev. 12:9. This system is called "the mystery of iniquity" (2 Thess. 2:7) in distinction from "the mystery of godliness" (1 Tim. 3:16). "The mystery of godliness" is the revelation of Christ in our flesh; "the mystery of iniquity" is the revelation of self (which is really the revelation of Satan) in our flesh. The one is the exaltation of Christ; the other is the exaltation of self. The one is Christianity; the other is paganism. The one means a belief in God; the other means a belief in self. The one means justification by faith; the other means justification by works.
