# Lesson 2 â€” The Question of Supremacy

*April 12, 1902*

In Rev. 14:6-14 we have a brief statement of the gospel of the kingdom as adapted to the special circumstances which will exist just before the second coming of the Lord. In the very hour of God's judgment the controversy over the law of God comes to its climax. Shall the supremacy of God be acknowledged or the supremacy of the beast and his image? Shall the Creator be worshiped, or shall the beast and his image be worshiped? In order that we may have a clear view of what is involved in these questions, we must see plainly what the real issue is.

The beast of Rev. 14:9 is evidently the same one mentioned in Rev. 13:14, to whom an image was to be made, and this beast is shown to be the same one spoken of in verses 2 and 3 of the same chapter by the reference to the deadly wound. This beast receives from the dragon "his [the dragon's] power, and his seat [throne], and great authority." But the dragon is Satan (Rev. 12:9); and so, when all the world worship the dragon and the beast (Rev. 13:4), who is simply the representative of the dragon, they are acknowledging the supremacy of Satan. This they do by asking the question, "Who is like unto the beast?" Verse 4. But this is the very question in which the supremacy of God is set forth (Ex. 15:11; Ps. 89:8), as well as in the direct statement (Jer. 10:7). And so the real question to be settled in the last generation is this, Who is God? Who is the rightful king? Whose supremacy is to be acknowledged? Shall Jehovah or Satan be worshiped? But this is not a new issue. It is the old issue, but now it is to be finally settled. Christ beheld Satan fallen from heaven (Luke 10:18, R. V.) just as the prophecy declares the fact (Isa. 14:12-14), and the cause was his effort to take the place belonging to God. Our first parents fell because of their effort to do the same thing. Gen. 3:4, 5. R. V. To man, who failed to recognize that he was made in the likeness of God (Gen. 1:26), and so lost that likeness, the gospel of the kingdom was preached (Gen. 3:15), which will restore the fallen one to be, "like Him" (1 John 3:2). The gospel of the kingdom teaches the supremacy of God as the true King, the Creator, as the One to be worshiped and served, in direct opposition to Satan's demand for worship and service, and the gift of the Son of God in the flesh, that man might be restored to the high position of likeness to God and the privilege of being servant to the King of the universe.

## Suggestions

Read carefully the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth chapters of Revelation, that the whole picture may be clearly in mind. Do not try to interpret the symbols in this lesson, as the present purpose is simply to settle some principles. The specific interpretation will come later. Be sure that the main point of the lesson, the question of supremacy as involved in worship and service, is brought out with clearness. The first part of the chapter in "Patriarchs and Prophets," "Satan's Enmity against the Law," might be read in connection with this lesson.
