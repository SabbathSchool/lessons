# Lesson 9 â€” The Law of God in the Ark and in the Heart

*May 31, 1902*

The tabernacle, as a mere building for the indwelling glory (Ex. 25:8; 29:43), was a constant prophecy of the divine-human temple in which His glory was to be manifested (John 1:14). The services of the tabernacle were an actual provision for present salvation, which was also a promise of the ministry of Christ in and through His taking the flesh. Heb. 9:6-12. The tabernacle was the home of the ark (2 Sam. 7:2), which was the receptacle for the law of God, the ten commandments (Deut. 10:3-5). All the services of the tabernacle had reference to man's relationship to that law (Heb. 9:7; 1 John 3:4) and the mediatorial work of Christ, through which the law would be put into the mind and heart of man (Heb. 8:6, 10). This was accomplished by His coming in the flesh to live the law in and for humanity. Ps. 40:7, 8. Thus the power of the endless life was provided in the place of merely fleshly effort (Heb. 7:16), and the dead letter was changed into the living promise (John 12:50; Rom. 8:2). God made choice of Abraham as the head of a people to whom He committed in a special manner the keeping of the truths of the gospel (Rom. 9:4), that through them He might teach His law to the world as the blessing of His indwelling life to save from sin, through the mediation of His Son in the flesh (Acts 3:25, 26). Their whole experience thereafter was a preparation for, and a fact-prophecy of, the coming Messiah, the incarnation of the Son of God. Not only did "all the prophets" teach this fundamental truth (Acts 3:24), but it was brought out in their history. Just in proportion as they made the teaching of the sanctuary and its services a reality in their lives, the power of this truth was shown in national prosperity. Deut. 28:13. If they refused to make this revelation of the truth through the obedience of faith, then came national adversity. Verses 58, 59, 62. And even in the men whom God raised up to deliver His people when they turned to Him, He was testifying to them and to the world of the salvation through the great Deliverer, who was to reveal Himself in humanity. Read Psalms 105 and 106, and note especially Ps. 105:42-45 and Ps. 106:39-45.
