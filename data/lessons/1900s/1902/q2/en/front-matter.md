## THE 83-CENT RATE

This rate has been in operation only since January 1, 1902, yet
many have taken advantage of it to such an extent that our mailing list has been materially increased.

For the benefit of those who have not fully understood the
plan, we state the offer again:—

For any one who is taking a club of five or more
Signs, either through his church club or from the
publishers direct, we will accept new single subscriptions
at 83 CENTS PER YEAR, WHEN ORDERED FOR
MISSIONARY PURPOSES.

### Added Facilities

make it possible for us to handle these extra subscriptions at
such a low rate.

### Another Feature

It is our plan at the present time to follow up each subscription
that expires and endeavor to secure a renewal of the same; but our
mailing list is now so classified that when a person sends a subscription if he does not care to have the name followed up we will
not do so. Missionary workers will at once see the advantage
in this.

## FEEDING UPON THE WORD

The only true way to study the Word of God is to feed upon it. We must eat it day by day. It must be digested and assimilated by that part of our organism which has been given to us for this purpose. We can not live upon a light lunch taken once a week. Our need is continuous, and the supply must be continuous. This does not mean that we must have the book before our eyes all the time, any more than we need to sit at the table all the time in order to satisfy our physical requirements; but as we need to sit at the table every day in order to supply that upon which the system feeds continually, so we must come to the direct study of the Word each day in order to supply that upon which our spiritual nature may feed continually. There must be a definite appropriation in each case of the definite provision which God has made for our need.

We wish to emphasize these principles in connection with the present lessons. They cover either directly or in a suggestive way sufficient ground to become the basis of daily study during the whole week. Those who live with them during the week will get the most from them on the Sabbath. Those who give them only a hasty and superficial study on Friday evening or Sabbath morning, will find it practically impossible to appropriate them as personal experience on so short an acquaintance with them. By some people this denomination has been given the credit of being Bible students, but we often feel compelled to think that this distinction is unmerited now, whatever may have been the case in the past. In view of the experiences which we are soon to face; in view of the wonderful revelation of light and truth which is now being made to us; in view of our great and constant need of being built up in the most holy faith—shall we not meditate upon these things? Shall we not give ourselves wholly to them? If we will do so, it is certain that our profiting will appear unto all. The following extracts may be helpful in stimulating us to form and carry into effect such a decision.

## A NECESSITY WHICH IS A PRIVILEGE

"It is a weak and pale word, and not at all corresponding to the real nature of the case and to the feelings of the Christian, to speak of our duty to read the Scriptures. Where there is reverence, love, trust; where there is joy in communion with God, we look upon the reading of Scripture not as a duty—one among many others. It stands by itself. Listening to the voice of God is not one of many duties, but it is the source as well as the regulator of all duties. It is not merely a work which our conscience declares to be right, but our very conscience, and affections, and will, and mind, our whole inner man, receives from this Word light and strength.

We feel it necessary to read the Scriptures, just as food is necessary to sustain life, and as we desire to breathe pure and fresh air. It is a necessity, not a compulsion of an external kind, which is opposed to our nature, and which is as a mechanical burden imposed on us. It is a necessity, in the sense that our whole spiritual life craves for it, and can not prosper without it. And is not one reason of our languid and feeble life the simple fact that we do not breathe sufficiently the Bible air? Sermons and tracts and religious books contain not sufficiently that ozone which is the exclusive characteristic of God's Word.

"But it may not be unnecessary to add a word on the copious reading of Scripture. Read the whole Scripture, for Scripture is a connected whole. Do not neglect the historical, or prophetic, or doctrinal portions. Forget not the book of Proverbs nor the little Epistle of Philemon. Think not that there is no food for the soul in the books of the Chronicles. God has given us the whole, and means us to use the whole, for it is all profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. We Protestants speak much, and at times somewhat boastfully, of our great reverence and love for the Bible. Is our glorying in truth? Do we love the Bible, not merely as a text-book from which to collect proofs for our doctrine, an armory from which to select weapons to defeat our opponents, but do we love the Bible as God's revelation, in which our minds are to be moulded, by which our hearts are to be influenced? Are there not many portions of Scripture so neglected that, if to-morrow some magic hand were to efface them from our editions, very few of us would miss them? Have we not received it more as a theory than a real and practical belief, that all the books of Moses, and prophets, and apostles are inspired, authoritative, profitable? Let us be really disciples, learners, not selecting, not rejecting, but receiving all our Lord has graciously caused to be written for our instruction.

"If such a diligent study of the Scripture should interfere with our reading of religious literature, we may rest satisfied that we shall not be losers, to say the least of it. While we use with gratitude the books in which men communicate their thoughts and experience, we must always, not merely in theory, but in practise, hold them in a subordinate position. The more the Bible has the preeminence, the greater will be our power of discernment, and the more shall we be truly benefited by the writings of men. A diligent study of Scripture will place us in the true position of not being in bondage to man, and of being willing to learn with gratitude from all servants of the Lord."—Christ and the Scriptures.

## SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES

The Sabbath-school affords to parents and children a precious opportunity for the study of God's Word. But in order to gain that benefit which they should gain in the Sabbath-school, both parents and children should devote time to the study of the lessons, seeking to obtain a thorough knowledge of the facts presented, and also of the spiritual truths which these facts are designed to teach. We should especially impress upon the minds of the young the importance of seeking the full significance of the scripture under consideration.

"In some schools, I am sorry to say, the custom prevails of reading the lesson from the lesson sheet. This should not be. It need not be, if the time that is often needlessly and even sinfully employed, were given to the study of the Scriptures. There is no reason why Sabbath-school lessons should be less perfectly learned by teachers or pupils than are the lessons of the day school. They should be better learned, as they treat of subjects infinitely more important. A neglect here is displeasing to God.

"Parents, set apart a little time each day for the study of the Sabbath-school lesson with your children. Give up the social visit, if need be, rather than sacrifice the hour devoted to the precious lessons of sacred history. Parents, as well as children, will receive benefit from this study. Let the more important passages of Scripture connected with the lesson be committed to memory, not as a task, but as a privilege. Though at first the memory may be defective, it will gain strength by exercise, so that after a time you will delight thus to treasure up the precious words of truth. And the habit will prove a most valuable aid to religious growth.

"If the time that is worse than wasted in gossip, in ministering to pride, or for the gratification of appetite, were devoted with equal interest to the study of the Bible, what encouragement would be given to our Sabbath-schools! But when parents are more anxious to have their children fashionably dressed than to have their minds stored with the truths of God's Word, the children themselves will soon learn to regard dress and display as of more consequence than the things which concern their salvation...

"Observe system in the study of the Scriptures in your families. Neglect anything of a temporal nature; dispense with all unnecessary sewing and with needless provision for the table, but be sure that the soul is fed with the bread of life. It is impossible to estimate the good results of one hour, or even half an hour, each day devoted in a cheerful, social manner to the Word of God. Make the Bible its own expositor, bringing together all that is said concerning a given subject at different times and under varied circumstances. Do not break up your home class for callers or visitors. If they come in during the exercise, invite them to take part in it. Let it be seen that you consider it more important to obtain a knowledge of God's Word than to secure the gains or pleasures of the world."—Testimonies on Sabbath-school Work.

## INTRODUCTORY

Those who wish to derive much benefit from these lessons must be willing to study faithfully. The lessons have been written in this particular way in order to develop a connected line of thought, but the brief statements with which the different Scripture references have been woven together are not designed to be the real theme of the lesson. In the Scriptures themselves will be found the truth to be studied, and the statements made in the lesson are intended merely as a guide in the study of the Word itself. Unless you see the truth in the living Word, and as the living Word, you will not be able to lay hold of the truth as a living experience. The lessons are suggestive rather than exhaustive, and it is hoped that they may prove a stimulus to the study of the subject itself, rather than the mere preparation of a Sabbath-school lesson.

It should also be remembered that the development of one phase of the truth contained in some passages of Scripture is not a denial of any other phases of the truth contained in the same passages, even though they are not specifically mentioned. The truth is infinite; and we can touch at best only upon "parts of His ways."

The questions may prove of some help in developing the subject, if they are used in the right way, or they may be made a hindrance to real study. The aim in preparing the lesson should not be merely to be able to answer the printed questions. They are intended to assist in getting a clear view of the connected chain of truth in the texts which are brought together in the lesson; and, with the help offered in the questions and the statements with which the texts are connected, the Scripture itself should be studied, until the whole subject becomes familiar to the mind in the exact words of the Scripture. It will usually be found helpful to read more than simply the verse or verses included in the reference. A clear understanding of the real meaning of a passage of Scripture often depends upon its relation to that which precedes or follows it, and sometimes upon both. It is a good thing to form the habit of examining carefully the whole paragraph from which a text is taken, and this will prevent that wrong application of Scripture which is often made possible by disregarding the connection in which it is found.

The earnest, prayerful study of God's Word will yield rich returns to every one who will give himself to it. And we have certainly come to a time now when every believer in the truth should sink the shaft deep, and know for himself that "the foundation of God standeth sure." It is the earnest hope of the writer of these lessons that they may contribute something toward this result.

The subject studied in this series of lessons will be continued and further developed in the next quarter's lessons.
