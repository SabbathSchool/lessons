# Lesson 13 â€” The Sure Mercies of David

*June 28, 1902*

It is death which prevents the continuance of a house or family (Heb. 7:23); and sin is the cause of death (James 1:15); and sin is disobedience to the law of God (1 John 3:4). Righteousness gives permanence to a house. Prov. 12:7. Therefore the promise to establish David's house forever (2 Sam. 7:16), and that his seed should never cease to exist (Ps. 89:35, 36), was the promise of a Saviour to come in the flesh, who should save from sin (Matt. 1:21), and bring to humanity complete victory over death and the grave (Rev. 1:17, 18). This was the blessing which David asked for his house (2 Sam. 7:29), the blessing of righteousness by faith (Rom. 4:6-8), that righteousness which is the basis of God's eternal throne (Ps. 97:2), and which has in it the assurance of eternity to man (Isa. 51:7, 8).

Through the promises made unto David of a throne and a house to be established forever, the covenant was made that the Son of God should become the Son of man and occupy David's throne (Luke 1:31, 32), as David's Son (Matt. 22:41, 42). This is the last Adam, the second Man (1 Cor. 15:45-47), the head of the new humanity, the promised Seed. Thus David's house became the Lord's house, and in this union of divinity with humanity the rock foundation was laid upon which the house was to be built which would continue eternally. Matt. 16:15-18. We personally share in "the sure mercies of David" by building upon the sure foundation (Isa. 28:16), and becoming a spiritual house (1 Peter 2:4, 5), the temple of the Lord (Eph. 2:21, 22). In this house the law of God is enshrined (Heb. 8:10), as in the tabernacle of old, and over it Christ the Lord is also Son (Heb. 3:6), as the pledge of its eternal continuance.
