## Words of Good Cheer

We have been delighted to know that our people are all more than pleased with the recent change in "The Sentinel." Our letter files are full of words of good cheer. We would like to have you read them all, but space forbids. Here are a few:—

The first number of The Sentinel for the year 1902 is excellent. The number ranks high in tone, and reveals thorough work on the part of the editor and all others aiding in its make-up.

I had feared that the change to a monthly magazine was unwise. It did not seem that a monthly could be fast enough for the hour. This number allays the remnant of that fear. Am satisfied its present form is best fitted for successfully doing the work to which it is called.

I am very much pleased with the change that has been made in the form of The Sentinel, for I believe in this way it will be very much more acceptable to the people than in its old shape. I shall do all I can for The Sentinel and its work.

Dallas, Texas.

It seems to me that The Sentinel is now a magazine that is worthy of notice from every one, as far as appearance is concerned; and what can be said of the matter in it is far ahead of anything that one would be able to say of its appearance.

Whenever I read The Sentinel, I think it ought to be in the hands of all who by their occupation or position have an influence in molding opinion, and I wish I could do more to extend its circulation among that class.

## SOME THINGS WHICH ARE NOW BEING DONE

The Retail Clerks' Association of Illinois are very persistent in their demands for Sunday closing of stores by law. This movement is being given national prominence by the press of the country.

The question of whether the United States shall send an ambassador to the Vatican has been given much attention of late.

Never before was there such a general and wide-spread movement to enforce Sunday closing of all stores, saloons, etc.

Rev. Dr. James B. Dunn, of the National Temperance Society, makes the following remarkable and significant statement:—

The battle now upon us means the triumph or overthrow of American institutions. . . . The American Sunday, by the statutes and fundamental laws of the land, is recognized as a day of exemption from civil labor. It is an American institution. . . . The American people are not prepared to exchange their God-given, time-hallowed, and honored Sunday for the European Sunday.

The Sentinel has done a very great work in the past in educating leading men—statesmen, politicians, molders of public opinion everywhere—in the true principles of liberty. The principles are the same to-day, and The Sentinel still advocates those principles with as much energy as it ever did. It should be in the hands of every citizen. To encourage giving it a wide circulation we make the following

## OFFER

To any one sending us a list of five or more names, we will address, wrap and mail The Sentinel for three months for 20 cents per name. In clubs of five or more copies sent to one address the rate is 70 cents a copy per year. To those who take 25 or more copies per month for house-to-house work or for street sales, we make the rate 5 cents per copy. Single subscriptions $1.00 per year. Please note these rates carefully.

In every community there are large numbers of people who ought to have The Sentinel, so every church should be taking a club of this periodical. Will you not agitate this important matter in your church?
