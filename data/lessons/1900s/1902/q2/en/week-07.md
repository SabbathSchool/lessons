# Lesson 7 â€” The Coming of the Seed

*May 17, 1902*

In the first announcement of the gospel (Gen. 3:15), the hope of salvation was made to rest upon a coming Deliverer (Rom. 11:26), who should appear in the flesh as the Seed of the woman. This was the last Adam, the second man. 1 Cor. 15:45, 47. By this promise human nature was brought into a personal relation with divinity (2 Peter 1:4), and the provision made for that power to conquer Satan and sin which is the very essence of the gospel (Rom. 1:16). It was faith in this revelation of Christ in the flesh as a present Saviour which made Abel's sacrifice "more excellent" (Heb. 11:4), which resulted in the translation of Enoch (verse 5), and which brought to Noah the experience of righteousness (verse 7). It was the rejection of this gospel message which permitted corruption and violence to increase (Isa. 24:5; Gen. 6:11, 12), and bring destruction upon the earth (verse 13).

To Abraham the same gospel was preached (Gal. 3:8), and abundant blessings promised, on condition that he should forsake all (Gen. 12:1-3). To him God made a promise (verse 7) which involved the coming of the Seed, the Messiah (Gal. 3:16). In the further development of this promise we find that it meant the restoration of the earth to man (Rom. 4:13) for an everlasting possession (Gen. 13:15; 17:7, 8). But it was distinctly stated that the consummation of these promises would not come during the natural lifetime of Abraham (Gen. 15:15), and they, therefore, included the resurrection of the dead. This was "the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers" (Acts 26:6-8), and included the coming of the Lord and the new earth (2 Peter 3:9-13).
