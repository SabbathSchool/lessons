# Lesson 10 â€” The Promises to David

*June 7, 1902*

The whole history of the children of Israel is of special value at this time (1 Cor. 10:12), but we are necessarily limited to the consideration of some special experiences. The time during which the chosen people of God were made the depositaries of the divine law is divided into three periods (Matt. 1:17), and the limit of each one constitutes a pivotal point in the history. In this brief outline of the development of the original promise of the Seed (Gen. 3:15), we now pass from the promise to Abraham, and shall next consider the promise to David. This naturally leads to a study of the seventh chapter of 2 Samuel.

## Notes

The primary object in this and the next lesson should be to become familiar with exactly what is said in this chapter. When this has been done, we shall be better prepared to understand what is meant by what is said. The main theme of the vision is evidently the king and his house. It is simply "the king" who is first introduced. David is mentioned by name only twice in the vision, and in each case it is "My servant David." As long as His people were journeying from place to place, and lived in tents, the Lord walked with them and made a tent His dwelling-place. Now that the people have a more permanent home, He will permit them to build Him a more permanent temple as His dwelling-place, where His worship shall be conducted. But He first emphasizes the fact that He will make David a house. And the vision closes with the emphatic declaration that David's house, and David's kingdom, and David's throne "shall be established forever."
