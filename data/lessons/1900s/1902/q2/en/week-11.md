## Notes

Note what was uppermost in David's mind as the result of the revelation which the prophet had made to him. By the power of His Word the Lord had united his house with eternity. "David's house" and "forever" would hereafter include the same immeasurable time, as the Lord had spoken them together. When the Lord talked about his house that way, it would surely be so, for in His Word, as the seed, was the thing promised.

David showed the spirit of true humility by acknowledging his own unworthiness, and yet accepting with unquestioning faith the complete fulfillment of all that the Lord had promised, just as Mary did. Luke 1:38. Because God was God, His words would surely come true, and the good thing which he had talked about would become a matter of experience to David. His seed would be "set up;" his house would be "established forever;" his kingdom and his throne would be "established forever." The eternal, everlasting, endless continuance of David's house was now assured.
