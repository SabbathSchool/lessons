# Lesson 8 â€” A Tent of Meeting and the True Temple

*May 24, 1902*

The everlasting covenant with Abraham (Gen. 17:7-9) was renewed to Isaac (Gen 26:1-4) and to Jacob (Gen. 28:13, 14), with all that was involved in the original promises. And the chief thing in all this was the gift of the Son of God in the flesh as the power of the promise to restore all things. John 8:56. In the altar which the patriarchs built wherever they settled temporarily (Gen. 13:7, 8, 18; 26:25; 33:20, and the services connected with it; in Abraham's experience with Melchizedek (Gen. 14:17-20), and in other instances which need not be specifically mentioned, the same lesson was being taught which was afterward given in a more detailed form in the tabernacle and its services. The truth thus revealed was the incarnation of the Son of God (John 2:18-21) and His mediatorship in the flesh (1 Tim. 2:5). In thus dwelling among them (Ex. 25:8; 29:45), and walking in a tabernacle (2 Sam. 7:6), God was setting forth His plan, through which even fallen humanity could again become the temple of the living God (2 Cor. 6:16). Thus the tabernacle and its services, afterward embodied in a more permanent form in the temple, constituted a parable (Heb. 9:8, 9, R. V.), a concrete revelation of the gospel. This "tent of meeting" (Ex. 29:42, R. V.), this "tabernacle of witness" (Acts 7:44), was constantly testifying to God's purpose that humanity should be His temple, through the gift of His Son in the flesh, who would become "the appointed meeting-place between God and humanity" (John 1:14, R. V., margin). Thus only could the seed of the woman inflict the mortal wound upon the serpent (Gen. 3:15) and save humanity (Heb. 2:14, 15). Thus would the foundation be laid (1 Cor. 3:11) upon which and in which would be established the true temple (Eph. 2:19-22), the church (1 Tim. 3:15), the body (Col. 1:18) of Him who is the greater and more perfect tabernacle (Heb. 9:11, 12), who was to build the temple of the Lord by becoming the Branch and growing up (Zech. 6:12, 13).
