The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult Bible
Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The preparation of the
guides is under the general direction of a worldwide Sabbath School Manuscript Evaluation
Committee, whose members serve as consulting editors. The published guide reflects the
input of the committee and thus does not solely or necessarily represent the intent of the
author(s).



                                                                                        1
The Crucified
At the Cross, He                 “All things were made by him; and
                               without him was not any thing made that
[Jesus, our Creator]           was made” (John 1:3).
bore “our griefs and             “All things” were made by Him, Jesus,
carried our sorrows”           and yet—according to Scripture—“Jesus
                               wept” (John 11:35). The Creator wept?
(Isa. 53:4)—all of             Even more so, Jesus was “despised and
them.                          rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
                               acquainted with grief” (Isa. 53:3). The
Creator, a man of sorrows, despised and rejected? And He once cried
out, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46).
   How could these things be? It’s because Jesus, our Creator, was also
our Redeemer, and as such He was the Crucified God—the Creator
who took on humanity and in that humanity suffered through a life of
privation and toil that ended with Him hung on a Roman cross.
   Thus, our Creator, the One in whom “we live, and move, and have
our being” (Acts 17:28), suffered in humanity in ways that none of us
ever could. We can experience only our own griefs, our own sorrows;
at the Cross He bore “our griefs, and carried our sorrows” (Isa. 53:4)—
all of them. It’s the most amazing act in all cosmic history.
   With that background (that of the crucified God looming over us
like the desert sky) we will for the next few months seek to better com-
prehend the incomprehensible—our own suffering, the sufferings of
Christians, of those who have committed their lives to Christ. We’re
making no claims to have all the answers or even many; we’re claiming
only that “God is love” (1 John 4:8) and that although these things hap-
pen, we can trust God despite them and, indeed, grow in grace through
them, no matter how painful the process.
   This quarter we will study the Word of God and see how other flesh
and blood, though radiated in faith, nevertheless faced despair,
betrayal, disappointment, loss, injustice, and abuse (sound like any-
thing you can relate to?). How did they cope? What did they learn?

Creator
 What can their examples teach us?
   As we look at these people, their experiences, their struggles, and
 their trials of faith (which might be much like our own), we must
 always see them contrasted against the background of the Cross. We
 must always remember that no matter what anyone faces, Jesus Christ,
 our Creator and Redeemer, went through much worse.
   Our God is a suffering God. Even Albert Camus, hardly a Christian,
 understood some of the implications of the Cross and the sufferings of
 God there: “The night on Golgotha is so important in the history of
 man only because, in its shadow, the divinity abandoned its traditional
 privileges and drank to the last drop, despair included, the agony of
 death.”—Albert Camus, The Rebel (New York: Vintage International,
 1991), p. 33. Or, as Ellen White expressed it, “The cross is a revelation
 to our dull senses of the pain that, from its very inception, sin has
 brought to the heart of God.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 263.
   Our lessons are not a theodicy, the justification of God in the face of
 evil. Instead, as we’ve said, they’re an attempt to help us work through
 the inevitable suffering we all face here in a world where sin is as easy
 as breathing. What we will try to show is that pain, suffering, and loss
 don’t mean that God has abandoned us; they mean only that, even as
 believers, we share now in the common lot of a fallen race. The differ-
 ence is that for us, through Jesus and the hope He offers, meaning and
 purpose can be found in what seems meaningless and purposeless and
 that somehow, even if we can’t imagine how, we can trust the promise
 that “all things work together for good to those who love God” (Rom.
 8:28, NKJV)—the God who, though He made all things, suffered all
 things, too (and that’s why we love Him).

   Gavin Anthony, this quarter’s principal contributor, grew up in Sri
 Lanka as a missionary kid. He worked as a pastor in England and was
 conference president in Iceland when he authored these lessons.

      The Shepherd’s
      Crucible


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Psalm 23, Rom. 12:18–21.

Memory Text: “He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths
      of righteousness for His name’s sake” (Psalm 23:3, NKJV).

             ophie leaned back against her bedroom door and slid to the

      S      floor. Tears were welling up fast, and it was only a moment
             before she was sobbing. “How could he? How could he!”
      Sophie had just received news that was breaking her heart. Someone
      she thought was a friend, someone she respected and trusted, was
      spreading awful gossip about her in order to ruin her reputation and
      the work she had been doing. Grabbing her Bible off the bed, she sud-
      denly found herself staring at some very familiar words: “He restores
      my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s
      sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
      will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they
      comfort me” (Ps. 23:3, 4, NKJV).
        “Surely this can’t be!” she blurted out to herself. But the logic
      seemed inescapable. The Shepherd in the psalm was guiding His
      sheep in paths of righteousness, but these very paths also seemed to
      wind their way into the valley of the shadow of death. Could it be pos-
      sible that even this painful betrayal by a friend, this dark valley, could
      be used by God to train her in righteousness?

     A Guide for the Journey:
     The Shepherd
       “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want” (Ps. 23:1, NKJV).

       Some children were asked to draw a picture of God. Each one drew
     a heart somewhere in it. When asked why, they declared unanimously
     that God is love.
       It is easy to have a good opinion about God and His purposes when
     everything is going well. As we grow older and life becomes harder
     and more complicated, our view of God often changes. God doesn’t
     change (Heb. 13:8, James 1:17); we do.
       Because of the pastoral lifestyle of the people in Old Testament
     times, Psalm 23 uses the image of a shepherd to describe how God
     cares for us. The symbol of a shepherd is used for God—in both the
     Old Testament and the New Testament. It’s a wonderful and change-
     less picture. Before we look at Psalm 23, let’s survey how different
     Bible writers understand the work and character of the Shepherd.

What do you learn about the Shepherd from each text?

      own picture of God has been obscured because of his or her
      struggles?


                                                                         7

      Locations on the Journey
       “He leads me in right paths for his name’s sake” (Ps. 23:3,
      NRSV).

         Imagine the “paths of righteousness” (vs. 3) stretching out before
      you, way out into the distance. You cannot see the end, but you know
      that at the end of the journey is home, God’s house. As you focus a lit-
      tle closer to you, do you see where the paths lead to? You can see some
      places clearly, but other parts are totally obstructed by large or dan-
      gerous obstacles. Sometimes the path disappears over a ridge. Some
      parts of the path are easy to walk along; others are difficult. It was just
      like this as Israel traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, and it is
      described the same way in this psalm.

Identify from Psalm 23 the locations that David sees the sheep pass-
      ing through when following the paths of righteousness as they
      make their way to the house of the Lord.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        But why are these paths called “paths of righteousness” (NIV, KJV)
      or “right paths” (NRSV)? Here are four important reasons. First, they
      are the right paths because they lead to the right destination—the
      Shepherd’s home. Second, they are the right paths because they keep
      us in harmony with the right Person—the Shepherd Himself. Third,
      they are the right paths because they train us to be the right
      people—like the Shepherd. Fourth, they are the right paths because
      they give us the right witness. As we become the right people, we give
      glory to the Lord. They are “right” or “righteous” paths whether the
      going is easy or hard.
        It is important to realize that when God leads us, it is not simply a
      question of His delivering a parcel to the destination. It is much more
      than guidance and protection. Like the many examples all through the
      Bible in which God is leading His people (whether it is leading
      Abraham by His promises or leading Israel by the pillar of fire and
      cloud), when God is guiding, it is always about Him training His peo-
      ple in righteousness.

       How conscious are you that righteousness is the Shepherd’s pri-
       ority for your life? How can trials change your life so that you
       better reflect the character of Christ?

               T UESDAY October 2

     Unexpected Detour 1: The Valley
       “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
     I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff,
     they comfort me” (Ps. 23:4, NKJV).

        It would be nice if the paths of righteousness wound their way only
     along the grass-covered banks of cool streams. But that is not the way
     David paints it. Also along these paths is the valley of the shadow of
     death—not a place that we are too eager to visit! At certain times of
     the year, the wadis and ravines found in Israel are prone to flash floods
     that could come unexpectedly and prove overwhelming. These places
     are also characteristically narrow, with steep sides that block out the
     light. Hence, “the shadow of death” is an image for a “very deep
     shadow” or “deep darkness.”

Think about the times you have been in your own “valley of the
     shadow of death.” What has it been like? Did you have fear, even
     though you knew that the Shepherd was there? Which Bible texts
     were most precious to you at that time and why?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

How do you think the sheep ended up in the valley? Do you think the
     sheep went there on their own, or did the Shepherd lead the sheep
     that way Himself? Justify your answer.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Elisabeth Elliot writes, “A lamb who found himself in the Valley of
     the Shadow of Death might conclude that he had been falsely led. It
     was needful for him to traverse that darkness in order to learn not to
     fear. The Shepherd is still with him.”—Quest for Love (Grand Rapids,
     Mich.: Fleming H. Revell, 1996), p. 218.

      Have you ever felt that you have been “falsely led” into the val-
      ley? How did you respond to God during this time? Why do you
      think the Shepherd might be willing to risk being misunder-
      stood by permitting us to enter a dark valley?


                                                                            9

      Unexpected Detour 2:
      The Surrounded Table
        “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
      You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over” (Ps. 23:5, NKJV).

        Throughout our lives we will inevitably have enemies. How do you
      deal with them? Have you ever lain awake at night, dreaming up ways
      to take revenge on those who are trying to hurt you or destroy your
      work? It can be hard for Christians to deal with enemies.

What type of enemies have you had? How have you responded to
      those who have tried to hurt you? How well did you follow Christ’s
      words in Matthew 5:44 or Paul’s words in Romans 12:18–21?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In Psalm 23:5, David shows us a way of dealing with enemies. He
      obscures their presence by looking instead at what God is doing in his
      behalf. And God is there preparing a banquet for him.
        In David’s culture, when an honored guest came for a feast, the host
      would anoint his head with oil as the guest was about to enter the ban-
      queting hall. The oil was a mixture of olive oil and perfume. Then the
      guest would be seated in front of far more food than he or she could ever
      eat.

How could the three items (table, oil, cup) in Psalm 23:5 help to remind
      us about how God provides, even when we are in the valley?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         As Paul reminds us, “our struggle is not against enemies of blood
      and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cos-
      mic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil
      in the heavenly places” (Eph. 6:12, NRSV). Our enemies include those
      we see and those we don’t. Yet, when we are with the Shepherd, not one
      enemy, visible or invisible, can steal what He has provided for us.

       Reflect on how the Shepherd has treated you when you have
       been surrounded by enemies. What can you see during these dif-
       ficulties that can enable you to give thanks?

      A Certain Promise for the Journey
         “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
      life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever” (Ps. 23:6,
      NKJV).

        In the valley or surrounded by enemies, it is sometimes tempting to
      believe we are alone. It does not always feel as though God has been
      doing much. But David obviously does not see it like this.

In spite of his trials, what two things does David say in verse 6 that he is
      certain of? See also Eph. 1:4, 2 Pet. 1:10, Heb. 11:13–15.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Some translations say that goodness and unfailing love will “follow”
      me all the days of my life. But the original verb is stronger, and the text
      should read that goodness and unfailing love will “pursue” me all the
      days of my life. (In fact, it’s the same verb form used in Genesis 14:14,
      Joshua 10:19, and 1 Samuel 25:29 where the idea of “pursuit” is very
      clear.)

How do you picture goodness and unfailing love “pursuing” you?
      What do you think David meant by describing God’s care for us
      this way?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         No matter how deep the valley or persistent the enemies, the certainty
      of God’s goodness, unfailing love, and guidance is unquestionable. If
      these thoughts could sustain Jesus through Calvary, we should take heart.
         There are times, however, when those we care for are full of questions.
      Like David, the best way to address these concerns is often not with a
      theological description of what God can do. Rather, as David shows us
      in verse 6, it is through an affirmation, the sharing of a personal convic-
      tion, of the truth about our God.

       What evidence is there from your own knowledge of God that
       illustrates the certainty of His goodness and unfailing love?
       What evidences could you add from the Bible? How could you
       share this with those who may be questioning God’s care? How
       is the Cross the greatest example of this “pursuit”?

                                                                             11

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Missionaries in the Home,”
         p. 143, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4; “The Divine Shepherd,”
         pp. 476–484, in The Desire of Ages.

           “Those who are finally victorious will have seasons of terrible per-
         plexity and trial in their religious life; but they must not cast away
         their confidence, for this is a part of their discipline in the school of
         Christ, and it is essential in order that all dross may be purged away.
         The servant of God must endure with fortitude the attacks of the
         enemy, his grievous taunts, and must overcome the obstacles which
         Satan will place in his way. . . .
1          “But if you keep looking up, not down at your difficulties, you will
         not faint in the way, you will soon see Jesus reaching His hand to help
         you, and you will only have to give Him your hand in simple confi-
         dence, and let Him lead you. As you become trustful, you will become
         hopeful. . . .
           “You will find help in Christ to form a strong, symmetrical, beauti-
2        ful character. Satan cannot make of none effect the light shining forth
         from such a character. . . . God has given us His best gift, even His
         only-begotten Son, to uplift, ennoble, and fit us, by putting on us His
         own perfection of character, for a home in His kingdom.”—Ellen G.
         White, Messages to Young People, pp. 63, 64.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 To what extent have you been aware that the “terrible per-
3         plexity and trial” that comes into your life may actually be part
          of your “discipline in the school of Christ”?

          ●2 How might our help, comfort, and encouragement to those in
          the valley be part of the Shepherd’s way of getting people
          through their crises? What things can you as a church do to be
          better used by the Lord to help those in need?

          ●
          3 In class, go around and have each person talk about how good-
          ness and mercy “pursued” them. What can you learn from one
          another’s experiences?

          ●4 Think about the last hours of Christ’s life, as He entered into
          the crucible. From what you can tell, either from the Bible or
          Ellen White (The Desire of Ages is a great source), how was Jesus,
          in His humanity, able to endure? What can we take from His
          example for ourselves in whatever crucibles we face, as well?

Stubborn Believer
by ISAAC ROBLES
   I first learned about Adventists when I was ten years old. My older
brother, Felipe, had become an Adventist and shared with me what he was
learning. But my father did not like Felipe’s new religion and told him to
stop teaching me and taking me to church. My father thought Adventists
were a strange cult that had brainwashed my brother. Although my brother
could no longer take me to church, I had learned enough to know that the
Sabbath was special. So I tried to spend Sabbaths in my room. I read the
Bible and some Ellen White books my brother gave me.
   I continued to keep the Sabbath in my room, but my father forced me to
attend church with him on Sunday and take part in certain rituals. I didn’t
want to, but I was just a kid.
   My brother had moved to New York, and when I was 12 I went to visit
him there. At last I could go to church, finish Bible studies, and be bap-
tized. I felt great that I could follow God. I thought that when my father
knew I had been baptized, he would let me worship according to my faith,
but that didn’t happen. He still made me go to church with him and for-
bade me to go to church on Sabbath.
   For four years I tried to keep the Sabbath, all while my father, aunts, and
uncles tried to talk me out of it. Some of my cousins called me “Bible
man,” but still I did not give up.
   One day my cousin found a tract in the trash. He read it and asked me
about it. I told him Adventists printed it, and he read it with interest. But
I could not teach him or take him to church.
   When I was 17 my brother’s father-in-law visited and invited me to go
to church. At last my father allowed me to start attending church. I told the
church pastor about my cousin and the tract he had found. The pastor and
I visited my cousin and his wife, and we gave them Bible studies. He and
his wife have decided to be baptized as well.
   My father even allowed me to study at the Adventist university in Puerto
Rico. I praise God for providing a sponsor and a job to help me pay my
fees. My father and I have a better relationship now. I hope that one day
he will accept my faith.
   I thank God for my brother who shared what he learned with me. Your
mission offerings make it possible for thousands to hear God’s Word every
day.

      The Crucibles That Come




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 9:7–16, Rom. 1:21–
      32, 2 Cor. 12:7–12, 1 Pet. 4:12–19, 5:8–11.

Memory Text: “Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful
      trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happen-
      ing to you. But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of
      Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed”
      (1 Peter 4:12, 13, NIV).
          n chemistry labs one often places various materials into a small

      I   container and heats them to extreme temperatures. As the con-
          tainer becomes hotter, the materials either melt, fizzle, spit, or
      burn brightly, depending upon what they are made of. The container
      is called a crucible.
         A crucible is defined in the dictionary as (1) a vessel used for melt-
      ing a substance that requires a high degree of heat, (2) a severe test,
      (3) a place or situation in which concentrated forces interact to cause
      or influence change or development.
         These definitions also give us a helpful insight into what happens in
      our spiritual lives. This week we’ll highlight some reasons that we
      may suddenly find ourselves under pressure and experiencing tests in
      places in which circumstances cause us to change, develop, and grow
      in character. This will help to give us an awareness of what God is
      doing in our lives so that when we enter a crucible, we will have an
      idea of how to respond.

      cult times that we experience through our lives?

     Surprises
       “Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are
     suffering, as though something strange were happening to you”
     (1 Pet. 4:12, NIV).

        Surprises, painful surprises, can come in many ways. A car veering
     across the road into your path. A sudden notification that you’re losing
     your job. A medical test that gives you unexpected bad news. The
     betrayal by someone you loved and who you thought loved you. As bad
     as the pain can be, it’s always made worse by the element of surprise.
        This week we will look at a few specific types of painful situations
     or crucibles that should not take us by surprise. To begin, let’s go back
     to the text for today in Peter. The Greek word for “surprised” in 1 Peter
     4:12 means to be “alien” or “foreign.” Peter is urging his readers not
     to fall into the trap of believing that fiery ordeals and trials are alien
     to Christian experience. Rather, they are to be considered normal—
     they can and should be expected.
        The word used for “fiery ordeal” (NRSV) or “painful trial” (NIV) or
     “fiery trial” (NKJV) comes from another Greek word, and it means “a
     burning.” In other places it is translated “furnace.” This experience of
     suffering for our faith could therefore be considered a “smelting
     process,” the process of the crucible.

Read 1 Peter 4:12–19. What is Peter’s message?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Many of us are surprised about suffering because we often have an
     oversimplified view of the Christian life. We know there are two sides—
     God, who is good; and Satan, who is bad. But often we then automati-
     cally put everything that feels good in the box with God and everything
     that feels bad in the box with Satan. But life is not so simple. We can-
     not use our feelings to decide what is in God’s box or Satan’s box.
     Sometimes walking with God can be challenging and hard. And fol-
     lowing Satan can appear to bring great rewards. Job, who is righteous
     yet suffering, illustrates this when he asked God, “ ‘Why do the wicked
     live on, growing old and increasing in power?’ ” (Job 21:7, NIV).

      Peter was referring to trials that are the consequence of standing
      up for Christ. But there are also other reasons that trials come.
      How could 1 Peter 4:12–19 help you to tactfully explain to a
      friend why they should not be surprised at the painful trials they
      might face?
                                                                            15

      Crucibles of Satan
        “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks
      about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Pet.
      5:8, NKJV).

Read the above text. What’s the message there for us? Ask yourself,
      “How seriously do I take these words?” What things do you do in
      your life that show whether you take them seriously?


        Have you ever watched a hungry lion? It’s awesome because you
      know it can catch and eat just about anything it wants. Peter says that
      Satan is prowling around in the same way. The great tragedy is that
      when we look around, we can see the consequences of his desire to
      kill. Death, suffering, and the twisting and perverting of morals and
      values are everywhere. We cannot escape seeing the work of Satan.

Read 1 Peter 5:8–11. How should Christians react to Satan’s prowling?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

What does God promise to do for those who are suffering? Verse 10.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Peter writes these words in the context of responding to Satan’s
      attacks on Christian faith. But as we have mentioned, Satan is at work
      in many different ways. And although we must be aware of the reality
      and the power of our enemy, we must never be discouraged, for we
      must always remember that Jesus has beaten Satan, that Satan is a
      defeated foe, and that as long as we stay connected with Jesus, as long
      as we cleave to Him in faith, we can never be defeated either. Because
      of the Cross, Christ’s victory is our victory.

       Think about the other ways that Satan causes pain. How could
       reading 1 Peter 5:8–11 help us to deal with the anguish that we
       experience because of our fate in living in a sinful world where
       Satan is allowed to wreak havoc?

Crucibles of Sin
  “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth
in unrighteousness” (Rom. 1:18, NKJV).

   Everything we do has a consequence. If you stand in the hot sun with
ice cream, it will certainly melt. Cause and effect always go together.
And no matter how desperately we would want things to be different,
it is the same with sin. It always reaps consequences. It is not that God
sits in heaven wondering what terrible things He could do to people
who sin; no, sin itself comes with its own built-in consequences.
   The problem is that many times we think that we can somehow out-
wit God and sin without the consequences. It never happens. Paul
makes it very clear that sinning has not only consequences for eternity
but painful and distressing consequences today.

  In Romans 1:21–32, Paul describes the process of people falling
into sin and the consequences of those sins. Read prayerfully and care-
fully these verses, and summarize the essence of what he is saying,
focusing specifically on the stages of sin and its consequences.

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

  Earlier Paul describes these consequences as the “wrath of God”
(vs. 18). God’s wrath in this passage is simply God allowing human
beings to reap what they sow. Even for Christians, God does not
always intervene immediately to remove the pain that results from our
own actions. Many times He allows us to experience the consequences
of our actions in order that we may understand how deeply damaging
and offensive our sin is.
  We have been considering the consequences of breaking God’s
moral laws. But what about breaking God’s health laws? Our bodies
are God’s home. If we abuse our bodies by failing to eat healthfully or
exercise, or if we regularly overwork, this is also sin against God. And
this has consequences that can create the conditions of a crucible.

 How, in your own life, have you reaped the immediate conse-
 quences of your own sins? What lessons have you learned? What
 changes must you make in order not to go through something
 similar again?

                                                                     17

     Crucibles of Purification
       “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘Behold, I will refine them
     and try them; for how shall I deal with the daughter of My people?’ ”
     (Jer. 9:7, NKJV).

       “If the Spirit of God brings to your mind a word of the Lord that
     hurts you, you may be sure that there is something He wants to hurt to
     death.”—Oswald Chambers, My Utmost for His Highest (Uhrichsville,
     Ohio: Barbour & Company, Inc., 1963), Sept. 27.

How do you understand the above quote and text? What has been
     your own experience with the pains involved in the purification
     process?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

Read Jeremiah 9:7–16. God says that He will “refine and test”
     (NRSV), or “melt” (KJV), Judah and Jerusalem (vs. 7, NIV). What
     two reasons does God give for this? How will the refining happen?
     (vss. 15, 16).

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        God’s refining and testing involved drastic action. There are per-
     haps three reasons why such refining and testing may feel like a cru-
     cible. First, we experience pain as God uses circumstances to bring
     our sin to our attention. A little earlier, Jeremiah unhappily writes,
     “ ‘The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the
     refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out’ ” (Jer. 6:29,
     NIV). Thus, sometimes drastic action is needed in order to get our
     attention. Second, we experience anguish as we feel sorrow for the sin
     we now see clearly. Third, we experience frustration as we try to live
     differently. It can be quite uncomfortable and difficult to keep choos-
     ing to give up the things that have been so much a part of us.

      Think about the sins that you struggle with. If God was going to
      refine and test you today, how might He do it? What action
      could you take now to deal with this before God would want to
      take drastic steps with you, as He did with Israel?

     Crucibles of Maturity
       “And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of
     the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of
     Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure” (2 Cor. 12:7,
     NKJV).

        There is a big difference between cutting down and pruning. We cut
     down plants that we don’t want anymore; we prune plants that we want
     to develop into greater fruitfulness. Both processes, however, do involve
     a sharp knife. Indeed, pruning requires cutting parts off the plant that
     might seem to a novice gardener like destroying it. In a spiritual context,
     Bruce Wilkinson writes, “Are you praying for God’s superabundant
     blessings and pleading that He will make you more like His Son?
        “If your answer is yes, then you are asking for the shears.”—Secrets
     of the Vine (Sisters, Ore.: Multnomah Publishers, Inc., 2001), p. 60.
        People have wondered what Paul actually meant by a “thorn in my
     flesh” (2 Cor. 12:7, NIV). Ideas range from Paul’s having constant
     attacks from enemies to having a speech difficulty. It seems that this
     was actually a problem with his eyesight.—Ellen G. White Comments,
     The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1107. Amazingly, Paul believed
     that his “thorn” was “given me.”

What do you think Paul meant by “given me”? Who gave it to him?
     How was God able to use it for Paul’s benefit?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Notice that Paul’s “thorn” had a definite purpose: “to keep me from
     becoming conceited” (vs. 7, NIV). It was not because of any specific
     sin he had committed but to prevent him from sinning in the future.
     Paul recognized that he had, by nature, a weakness to sin and that this
     “thorn” could guard against it.

Read 2 Corinthians 12:7–12. How does Paul deal with his “thorn”?
     Do you think that Paul’s weakness had any other spiritual bene-
     fits to him? How can the way that Paul responds help you to deal
     with “thorns” that you may have to carry?

         Commentary, vol. 4; “Enduring Trials,” p. 92, in My Life Today.

            “He who reads the hearts of men knows their characters better than
         they themselves know them. He sees that some have powers and sus-
         ceptibilities which, rightly directed, might be used in the advancement
         of His work. In His providence He brings these persons into different
         positions and varied circumstances that they may discover in their
         character the defects which have been concealed from their own
1
         knowledge. He gives them opportunity to correct these defects, and to
         fit themselves for His service. Often He permits the fires of affliction
         to assail them that they may be purified.”—Ellen G. White, The
         Ministry of Healing, p. 471.

    Discussion Questions:
2
          ●
          1 It really can be hard while we are reaping the consequences of
          our sin. “Will I ever be able to be made right with God again?”
          we ask. What promises does God make that can encourage us to
          persevere through such times and not give up? (See what Paul
          writes later in Romans 5:1–11.) What can you say to someone
          who is asking this very question?

3
          ●2 What does Ellen White mean by “His providence”? How does
          this work? How do you know when something happens by God’s
          providence? What acts of God’s “providence” have led to trials in
          your own life? As a class, discuss what you’ve learned at this
          time. How might you help someone else who is wondering
          whether some event is indeed “His providence”?

          ●3 If you know someone going through a crucible right now, does
          it matter, or should it matter, what brought it on? That is, how
          should you react to them and their suffering, regardless of what
          caused it?

          ●
          4 A Christian young man living in South America went through
          a bitter trial. After it was over, he moved to Europe and later
          commented to someone, “I left my corpse in South America.”
          What does that mean? Why must we all, in a sense, leave our
          corpse somewhere? What role do trials have in that process?

          ●
          5 As a class, plan an outing to a hospital or somewhere where
          you could be of help, comfort, and cheer to those who are, for
          whatever reason, being squeezed in a crucible.

Running Away to God
by SERGEI VENEVTSEV
   I was born into a Russian family that had no use for God. But in high
school I had to take a class called History of Religions. The teacher, a
Muslim man, taught about most main religions, but he had more enthusi-
asm for Christianity and read quotations from the Bible and told us Bible
stories.
   I decided religion might help me make sense out of life, so I began
searching different religions. I tried several different religions, but they left
my heart empty. It seemed they all were the same, saying I must earn favor
with God—whatever His name was—by my deeds. I did not need such a
religion; I needed answers to my questions.
   Then I saw a TV program produced by Seventh-day Adventists called,
Waiting for the Second Coming. It caught my interest, and I thought, It
would be good to belong with these believers who live as a family. But I did
not know where to find these Adventists.
   I started reading the New Testament, and though I did not understand
many things, I kept reading, for I found great peace. I began to pray, and to
my surprise, God answered. Then I broke up with my girlfriend. I prayed
again, but it seemed that this time God did not answer. Angry, I shook my
fist at God and shouted, “I do not need You. I will reach my goals myself!”
   The results of my prayer came immediately. I had been a peaceful per-
son, but after I rebelled against God, I became hard and wanted revenge on
everyone who hurt me. I started drinking and fighting. Evil spirits entered
my life and our home. I began to think life was futile and not worth living.
   Then a friend invited me to a Christian meeting. At first I refused to go,
then I changed my mind. I decided it would be my first and last time at a
Christian meeting. But once there, I was touched by the songs, the prayers,
and the Bible study. I could hardly wait for the next one. Within a year I had
surrendered my life to Christ.
   After high school and my term in the army, I returned home to work as
a literature evangelist. Then God called me to serve as a Global Mission
pioneer in an area where there were no Adventists. The Lord blessed my
partner and me and led us to people who were searching for meaning in
life. In our first year nine people have been baptized and others are prepar-
ing.
   I praise God for being patient with me, loving me, saving me, and allow-
ing me to serve Him.

          LESSON             3       *October 13–19



      The Birdcage




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exodus 14, 15:22–27,
      17:1–7, Proverbs 3, Luke 4:1–13, 1 Pet. 1:6–9.
Memory Text: “In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a lit-
      tle while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials”
      (1 Peter 1:6, NKJV).
           n the full light of day, and in hearing of the music of other voices,

      I    the caged bird will not sing the song that his master seeks to teach
           him. He learns a snatch of this, a trill of that, but never a separate
      and entire melody. But the master covers the cage, and places it where
      the bird will listen to the one song he is to sing. In the dark, he tries
      and tries again to sing that song until it is learned, and he breaks forth
      in perfect melody. Then the bird is brought forth, and ever after he can
      sing that song in the light. Thus God deals with His children. He has
      a song to teach us, and when we have learned it amid the shadows of
      affliction we can sing it ever afterward.”—Ellen G. White, The
      Ministry of Healing, p. 472.
         Notice that the one who carries the bird into the darkness is the mas-
      ter himself.
         It is easy to understand that Satan causes pain, but would God
      Himself actively take a part in guiding us into crucibles where we
      experience confusion or hurt?
The Week at a Glance: What examples can you think of
      in the Bible in which God Himself leads people into experiences
      that He knows will include suffering? What do you think were the
      new songs He wanted them to sing?

      To the Promised Land Via a Dead End
        “And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their
      eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were
      very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord”
      (Exod. 14:10, NKJV).
         Have you ever been set up, led into a trap or to a dead end?
      Sometimes it can be nice, like walking unexpectedly into a room of
      waiting friends who all shout “Surprise! Happy birthday!” At other
      times it can be quite a shock, even a very unpleasant one. It may have
      been bullies when you were at school or a work colleague who unex-
      pectedly tried to make you look bad.
         From the day the Israelites left Egypt until they reached the Promised
      Land, “the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them
      on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that
      they could travel by day or night” (Exod. 13:21, NIV). Every part of
      their journey was led by God Himself. But look at where He led them
      first: to a place where the sea was before them, mountains were on
      either side, and Pharaoh’s army was within eyesight right behind!
Read Exodus 14. Why did God bring the Israelites to a place where
      He knew they would be terrified?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Following “the pillar” doesn’t assure us of being happy all the time.
      It also can be a hard experience, because training in righteousness
      takes us to places that test our hearts, which are so naturally deceitful
      (Jer. 17:9). During these difficulties, the key to knowing when we are
      truly following God is not necessarily the absence of trials or pain but,
      rather, an openness to God’s instruction and a continual submission of
      our minds and hearts to His leading.
What lesson did the Israelites learn from this experience? Exod. 14:31.
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       Why is trusting God sometimes so hard, even though we may
       know many of the wonderful promises He has for us? Recount
       some difficult situation you believe the Lord led you into in
       order to teach you to “believe” in and to “fear” Him.

                                                                           23

     Bitter Waters
       “The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin,
     traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They
     camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to
     drink” (Exod. 17:1, NIV).

       We might surely not get from God everything we want, but can’t we
     expect to get all that we need? Not what we think we need but what
     we truly need?
       There was one thing the Israelites certainly needed, and that was
     water. Just after God led the Israelites through the Red Sea in the
     cloud, they followed Him through the hot, waterless desert for three
     days. Particularly in the desert, where finding water is so critical, their
     desperation is understandable. When would they get the water they
     needed?
       So, where does God lead them? The pillar goes to Marah, where, at
     last, there is water. They must have been excited. But when they tasted
     the water, they immediately spat it out because it was bitter. “So the
     people grumbled against Moses, saying, ‘What are we to drink?’ ”
     (Exod. 15:24, NIV).
       Then, a few days later, God does it again. This time, however, the
     pillar actually stops where there is no water at all (Exod. 17:1).

Read Exodus 15:22–27 and 17:1–7. What did God reveal to Israel
     about Himself at Marah and at Rephidim? What lessons should
     they have learned?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      In Rephidim, what question did the children of Israel ask?
      (Exod. 17:7). Have you ever asked the same question? If so, why?
      How did you feel, and what lessons did you learn after you had
      it answered? How many times do we need to get it answered
      before we stop asking it altogether?

     The Great Controversy in the Desert
       “And Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the
     Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being
     tempted for forty days by the devil” (Luke 4:1, 2, NKJV).

Read Luke 4:1–13. What lessons can you learn from this account
     about how to overcome temptation and not give in to sin?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Temptations can be so difficult because they appeal to things we
     really desire, and they always seem to come at our weakest moments.
        Luke 4 is the beginning of the story of Jesus’ temptation by Satan,
     and it brings some difficult issues to our attention. At first glance, it
     appears that the Holy Spirit is leading Jesus into temptation. However,
     God never tempts us (James 1:13). Rather, as we have been seeing,
     God does lead us to crucibles of testing. What is striking in Luke 4 is
     that the Holy Spirit can lead us to times of testing that involve our
     being exposed to Satan’s fierce temptations. At such times when we
     feel these temptations so strongly, we may misunderstand and think
     we have not been following God correctly. But this is not necessarily
     true. “Often when placed in a trying situation we doubt that the Spirit
     of God has been leading us. But it was the Spirit’s leading that brought
     Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. When God brings us
     into trial, He has a purpose to accomplish for our good. Jesus did not
     presume on God’s promises by going unbidden into temptation, nei-
     ther did He give up to despondency when temptation came upon Him.
     Nor should we.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 126, 127.
        Sometimes when in the crucible we get burned rather than purified.
     It is therefore very comforting to know that when we crumble under
     temptation, we can hope again because Jesus stood firm. The good
     news is that because Jesus is our Sin Bearer, because He paid the
     penalty for our failure to endure that temptation (whatever it was),
     because He went through a crucible worse than any of us will ever
     face, we are not cast off or forsaken by God. There is hope, even for
     the “chief ” of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15).

      What temptations are you facing now? Spend some time in
      prayer, asking the Lord to teach you how to apply the lessons
      from Jesus’ example in your own life. Remember, you don’t have
      to succumb to temptation, ever! Remember, too, that you have a
      Savior if you do.

                                                                          25

     An Enduring Legacy
Read 1 Peter 1:6, 7. What is Peter saying?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Peter is writing to people who were battling through difficulties and
     often felt very alone. He was writing “to God’s elect, strangers in the
     world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and
     Bithynia” (1 Pet. 1:1, NIV). This is the area we know today as western
     Turkey. A few texts later, Peter says that he knows that they are expe-
     riencing “grief in all kinds of trials” (vs. 6, NIV).
What does he mean by saying that they are “strangers” and “scat-
     tered”? How might that add to their trials?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Being a Christian during these times was a new thing; believers
     were small in number and in various places where they were a decided
     minority that was often misunderstood at best, persecuted at worst.
     Peter assures them, however, that these trials are not random or
     chaotic (vss. 6, 7). Genuine faith is the goal of those who persevere
     through “all kinds of trials.”

Read 1 Peter 1:6–9. What ultimate assurance does Peter seek to give
     these people amid their trials? What does that hope mean for us too?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      Whatever their trials, whatever they suffer, how can it be com-
      pared to the eternity that awaits them when Christ returns?
      Peter’s words to them are God’s words to us, regardless of what-
      ever we are facing. However difficult or painful our trials, we
      must never lose sight of the ultimate end, eternal life in a new
      heaven and new earth, without pain, suffering, or death. With
      such a promise before us, a promise guaranteed us through the
      death of Jesus, how important that we not lose faith but, instead,
      amid our trials ask the Lord to purge us of everything and any-
      thing that stands in the way of our faith.

     Trial by Fire
        There was a young man. We’ll call him Alex. He had come out of a
     very troubled youth: drugs, violence, even some time in jail. But then,
     through the kindness of a local church member (whom Alex had
     stolen from), Alex learned about God and gave his heart to Jesus.
     Though he still had his problems and struggles, and though elements
     of his past still lingered, Alex was a new person in Jesus. He loved
     God and sought to express that love by obeying His commandments
     (1 John 5:1, 2). At one point Alex felt impressed that he should be a
     minister. Everything pointed to it. He was answering God’s call, no
     doubt about it.
        At college things went well at first. Then one thing after another
     went awry, and his life began coming apart. His source of money
     started to dry up; a close friend turned against him, making accusa-
     tions about him that were false but that damaged his reputation. Next,
     he kept on getting sick; no one knew what it was, but it impacted his
     studies to the point where he was afraid that he was going to have to
     drop out of school completely. On top of it all, he was fighting fierce
     temptations with drugs, which were readily available in the local com-
     munity. At one point he even fell in that area. Alex couldn’t under-
     stand why all this was happening, especially because he was sure that
     the Lord had led him to this school to begin with. Was Alex wrong
     about that? If so, was his whole experience with God a huge mistake?
     Even the most basic elements of his faith were coming under doubt.

Imagine that, amid this crisis, Alex came to you and asked for
     advice. What would you say? What experiences have you had that
     could help someone like him? What Bible texts would you use?
     How helpful might the following texts be in such a situation?
     Proverbs 3, Jer. 29:13, Rom. 8:28, 2 Cor. 12:9, Heb. 13:5.

      Almost all who follow the Lord have had crises during which
      they’ve been tempted to doubt the Lord’s leading. The impor-
      tant thing in such situations is to cling to the promises, recount
      God’s leading in the past, and pray for faith and endurance. The
      Lord will never give up on us; it’s we who have to fight the temp-
      tation to give up on Him.
                                                                         27

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Exodus,” pp. 281–290;
         “From the Red Sea to Sinai,” pp. 291–302, in Patriarchs and
         Prophets; “The Temptation,” pp. 114–123, in The Desire of Ages.

           “But of old the Lord led his people to Rephidim, and he may choose
         to lead us there also, to test our loyalty. He does not always bring us
         to pleasant places. If he did, in our self-sufficiency we should forget
         that he is our helper. He longs to manifest himself to us, and to reveal
         the abundant supplies at our disposal, and he permits trial and disap-
         pointment to come to us that we may realize our helplessness, and
1        learn to call upon him for aid. He can cause cooling streams to flow
         from the flinty rock. We shall never know, until we are face to face
         with God, when we shall see as we are seen, and know as we are
         known, how many burdens he has borne for us, and how many bur-
         dens he would have been glad to bear, if, with childlike faith, we had
         brought them to him.”—Ellen G. White, “Rephidim,” Review and
2        Herald, April 7, 1903.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 We often talk of temptation as an individual thing, which, of
          course, it is. At the same time, are there any corporate tempta-
          tions, things that we as a church or a local church family might
          have to guard against as a group? If so, what?

3         ●
          2 Have those who are willing talk about any of the “unpleasant
          places” that they have been brought to. Why have they been
          unpleasant? If they had to revisit them today, would they view
          them differently?

          ●3 We all understand the principle behind God’s allowing us to
          be purified and refined by trials. How, though, do we understand
          the situation in which trials appear to have no value (for instance,
          someone is killed instantly in a car wreck)? As a class, seek to
          work through possible answers.

          ●
          4 As a class, take time together to pray for each other, that each
          might be strengthened to endure trials and stay faithful.

          ●
          5 Does your class know of anyone who, having faced trials, lost
          their way? If so, as a class what could you do in a very tangible
          way to help lead that person back?

Peace That Satisfies
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Kozo and Yukari were rock musicians in Japan. In addition Kozo owned
a recording studio where many young bands came to make recordings.
   Yukari wrote songs, many of which expressed a yearning for peace,
love, and freedom. The couple began to realize that the ideals they sang
about were missing from their lives, crowded out by counterfeits such as
drugs and free sex. They wanted real peace, real love, real freedom. They
wanted absolutes on which to build their lives, but they did not know
where to find them. They started searching in religion. The couple was
sure that a supreme Power, a Divine Person, existed somewhere in the uni-
verse. But how could they find Him?
   They decided to explore Christianity, to open their hearts to Christ’s
teachings. Kozo and Yukari heard people talk about their faith and reli-
gious ideas, but they seldom talked about Jesus. Surely, they thought, there
must be a church that teaches about Jesus, that builds its faith on what the
Bible says.
   The couple knew of the Adventist hospital in town, but they knew noth-
ing about the people who operated it. Yukari visited her neighbor, a
Seventh-day Adventist, and said, “Take me with you to your church.” The
neighbor gladly agreed.
   Yukari found Adventists friendly and sincere. Their religion came
straight from the Bible, and their health teachings made sense to her. She
began attending the church, but Kozo hesitated. His biggest workdays
were Sabbath and Sunday. However, when he had no appointments, he
joined Yukari at church. Soon he was scheduling his work on other days
when possible.
   Within weeks the couple placed their lives at Jesus’ feet, convinced that
He is God and their Savior. It took Kozo several months to overcome a
problem with alcohol, but soon after he did, they were baptized.
   Kozo closed his recording studio, giving up the couple’s security. For
five years the couple lived on faith alone. Then Kozo was offered a job as
recording engineer at the Voice of Prophecy studio. Kozo and Yukari have
found the peace, love, and freedom they had searched for so long. They
found it at the foot of the Cross.
   Japan has just 15,000 Adventist believers¸ only one believer for every
8,460 people in the country. Pray for the work in this great nation. Your
mission offerings will help reach the unreached there.

      Seeing the Goldsmith’s
      Face


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Job 23:1–10, Dan. 12:1–10,
      Matt. 5:16, 25:1–12, 1 Cor. 4:9, Eph. 3:10, 4:11–16.

Memory Text: “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in
      a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the
      same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord”
      (2 Corinthians 3:18, NKJV).

              my Carmichael took a group of children to a traditional gold-

      A       smith in India. In the middle of a charcoal fire was a curved
              roof tile. On the tile was a mixture of salt, tamarind fruit, and
      brick dust. Embedded in this mixture was gold. As the fire devoured
      the mixture, the gold became purer. The goldsmith took the gold out
      with tongs and, if it was not pure enough, he replaced it in the fire with
      a new mixture. But each time the gold was replaced, the heat was
      increased. The group asked, “How do you know when the gold is puri-
      fied?” He replied, “When I can see my face in it.”—Amy Carmichael,
      Learning of God (Fort Washington, Pa.: Christian Literature Crusade,
      1989), p. 50.
         God is seeking to purify us, to refine us like gold, to transform us
      into His image. That’s an astonishing goal, and it seems even more
      astonishing that a Christlike character is developed in us only as we
      pass through life’s crucibles.

The Week at a Glance: What role does suffering have in
      the purifying process? How do we understand all this in the con-
      text of the great controversy?

      “In His Image”
        “For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed
      to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
      many brethren” (Rom. 8:29, NKJV).

        In the beginning, God made us in His image (Gen. 1:27), but that
      image has been corrupted by sin.

In what ways do we see this defacing of God’s image in humanity?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        It’s obvious: We all have been corrupted by sin (Rom. 3:10–19). Yet,
      God’s desire is to restore us to what we should have originally been.
      This is where our text today fits in. It reveals God’s plan that for those
      who submit their lives to the Holy Spirit, they may be “conformed to
      the likeness of his Son” (Rom. 8:29, NIV).
        But there’s another dimension. “The very image of God is to be
      reproduced in humanity. The honor of God, the honor of Christ, is
      involved in the perfection of the character of His people.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 671.

How do you understand what Ellen White says to us in that quote?
      See also Job 1, Matt. 5:16, 1 Cor. 4:9, Eph. 3:10.

        As Christians, we must never forget that we are in the midst of a
      cosmic drama. The great controversy between Christ and Satan is
      unfolding all around us. The battle takes many shapes and is mani-
      fested in many ways. And though much is hidden, we can understand
      that, as followers of Christ, we have a part to play in this drama, and
      we can bring honor to Christ through our lives.

       Imagine being on the field of a huge stadium. Sitting in the
       bleachers on one side are heavenly beings loyal to the Lord; on
       the other side are beings who have fallen with Lucifer. If your
       life for the past 24 hours was played out on that field, which side
       would have more to cheer about? What does your answer tell
       you about yourself?

                                                                            31

     Faith Amid the Refining Fire
        It’s one thing to be in a battle; it’s another not even to see the forces
     arrayed in that battle. In a sense, this is what we as Christians deal
     with. We know that the forces are out there, we can feel them in our
     lives, and yet, we have to press ahead in faith, trusting Him “who is
     invisible” (Heb. 11:27, NKJV).

Read Job 23:1–10. What is the essence of Job’s struggle? What does
     he not see? At the same time, what does he take on faith, despite
     all his trials?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________


        Even amid his terrible trials, Job trusted in the Lord. Despite every-
     thing, Job was determined to endure. And one of the things that kept
     him persevering was gold. Not a gold medal; rather, he was looking
     into the future and realized that if he held on to God, he would come
     out the better for it—he would come out like gold. How much Job
     knew of what was happening behind the scenes, we aren’t told.
     Regardless of how much was hidden from him, he endured the refin-
     ing fire anyway.
        Do you fear the fire? Do you worry about the heat that circum-
     stances generate? Perhaps, as with Job, the heat of God seems unex-
     plainable. It may be the difficulty of adjusting to a new job or a new
     home. It could be having to survive ill treatment at work or even
     within your own family. It could be illness or financial loss. Hard as
     it is to understand, God can use these trials to refine you and purify
     you and bring out His image in your character.
        Being proven to be gold seems to be an incentive for Job here,
     something to fix his eyes upon and that helps pull him through his
     troubles. It’s a powerful testimony to his character already that, amid
     all the pain and suffering, he was able to sense the reality of the puri-
     fying process. Also, however much he didn’t understand, he knew that
     these trials would refine him.

      In your own experience, how do trials refine and purify? What
      other ways could you be refined other than through suffering?

     Jesus’ Last Words
       Jesus was in Jerusalem, about to die. According to Matthew’s
     Gospel, Jesus’ last teaching hour before Passover is spent telling His
     disciples parables, including the parables about the ten virgins and the
     sheep and the goats. These stories are related to the way we should live
     as we wait for Jesus to come. Thus their relevancy to today—with the
     signs of Jesus’ soon return all around us—has never been more impor-
     tant.
       In the parable of the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1–12), many commenta-
     tors point out that the oil is a symbol for the Holy Spirit. Ellen White
     agrees but also says that this oil is a symbol for character and that it is
     something no one can acquire for us.

Read the parable. In what ways does the meaning of the story
     change, depending on whether you see oil as a symbol of the Holy
     Spirit or for the possession of character? What are the implica-
     tions of this story for you if the oil represents the Holy Spirit, or a
     Christlike character?

Read the parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25:31–46.
     What criteria is used in separating the sheep and the goats?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________


         Notice that the king separates the sheep and the goats based on
     their works, their character. Though Jesus is not teaching salvation by
     works here, we can see how important character development is in the
     plan of salvation and how those who are truly saved by Christ will
     reflect that salvation through their lives and characters.

      It has been said that “character is what a person is in the dark.”
      What sort of person are you when no one is looking? What does
      that answer tell you about changes that need to be made?



                                                                            33

     “The Wise”
       Yesterday we looked at the importance of character for those wait-
     ing for the Second Coming. Today we will look more specifically at
     the importance of character for those who are alive at the second com-
     ing of Jesus.

Read Daniel 12:1–10. What is the context? What time in earth’s his-
     tory is being referred to? Most important, what can we tell from
     these texts about the character of God’s people alive at this time?
     What characteristics are given them, in contrast to the wicked?
     See also Rev. 22:11.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Daniel is told that just before Jesus comes, there will be a time of
     distress unequaled at any other time of history. In verse 3 and verse 10
     we’re given a depiction of the righteous and the wicked during this
     time. Notice how the wicked “shall do wickedly” (vs. 10, NKJV) in
     contrast to the righteous, who in verse 2 shine brightly, perhaps
     because they have been “purified, made spotless and refined” (vs. 10,
     NIV) during this “ ‘time of trouble, such as never was since there was
     a nation, even to that time’ ” (vs. 1, NKJV). In contrast, too, the wicked
     do not understand, but the righteous are “wise” and do understand.
        Understand what? Math, science, higher criticism? Proverbs says
     that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov. 1:7,
     NKJV). Perhaps, in this context, the “wise” are wise because they have
     an understanding of these final events, the time of trouble, as it
     unfolds. They are not taken by surprise; from their study of the Word,
     they know it’s coming. And most important, they know enough to
     allow this time of trouble to purify and refine them; the wicked, on the
     other hand, are just made more obstinate in their rebellion and thus
     continue in their wickedness.
        The crucial point is that we here are given a depiction of a people
     who have been through a refining and purifying process.

      Though we’ve looked at these texts in the context of the very last
      days, what principles do we see here that can help us now better
      understand what the purifying and refining process is all about,
      even for us today?

      Character and Community
        A song goes like this: “I am a rock, I am an island.” Have you ever
      felt like that? Wanting to stand alone? You may have even heard peo-
      ple say, “Well, my walk with God is a private affair. It’s not something
      I want to talk about.”

Read Ephesians 4:11–16. What’s the point Paul is making here? What
      role does he give here for community?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         When Paul writes to the Ephesians, he describes the church as a
      body. Jesus is the head, and His people make up the rest. If you look
      at verse 13, you will notice the ultimate purpose of living in such a
      community—it is to experience “the whole measure of the fullness of
      Christ” (NIV). And for that we need each other!
         It certainly is possible to be a Christian all alone. Indeed, like many
      people through the centuries who have been ridiculed or persecuted,
      standing alone is often unavoidable. It is a powerful witness to the power
      of God that men and women do not buckle under the pressures that sur-
      round them. However, while this is true, Paul is wanting to emphasize a
      critical truth: The fullness of Christ is ultimately experienced and
      revealed when we are working together in fellowship with each other.

In today’s text, what does Paul say must happen before the fullness of
      Christ may be revealed in our Christian community?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

In what way is the witness of a community revealing the fullness of
      Christ different from an individual revealing the fullness of Christ?
      What are the implications of this in the context of the great con-
      troversy? See Eph. 3:10.
      ____________________________________________________________________

       It’s easy to be nice when you are by yourself or with strangers,
       but it is much harder being nice to people you either know really
       well or don’t like. This means that when we still show these peo-
       ple grace and kindness, we provide an irresistible witness to the
       truth about God.

                                                                            35

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “God Promises Us a New
         Heart of Flesh,” p. 100, in Sons and Daughters of God; “To Meet the
         Bridegroom,” pp. 405–421, in Christ’s Object Lessons; “The Time of
         Trouble,” pp. 613–634, in The Great Controversy.

            “Character building is the most important work ever entrusted to
         human beings; and never before was its diligent study so important as
         now. Never was any previous generation called to meet issues so
         momentous; never before were young men and young women con-
         fronted by perils so great as confront them today.”—Ellen G. White,
         Education, p. 225.
1           “In the parable, the foolish virgins are represented as begging for oil,
         and failing to receive it at their request. This is symbolic of those who
         have not prepared themselves by developing a character to stand in a
         time of crisis. It is as if they should go to their neighbors and say, Give
         me your character, or I shall be lost. Those that were wise could not
         impart their oil to the flickering lamps of the foolish virgins. Character
2        is not transferable. It is not to be bought or sold; it is to be acquired. The
         Lord has given to every individual an opportunity to obtain a righteous
         character through the hours of probation; but he has not provided a way
         by which one human agent may impart to another the character which
         he has developed by going through hard experiences, by learning les-
         sons from the great Teacher, so that he can manifest patience under trial,
         and exercise faith so that he can remove mountains of impossibility.”
         —Ellen G. White, The Youth’s Instructor, Jan. 16, 1896.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What does “character building” mean? How can you do this?
          How much of a visible priority is character building within your
          own life and your church community?

          ●
          2 Thursday’s study talked about the important role of community
          in the life of a Christian. How well does your local church function
          as the body of Christ? How well do you represent the Lord as a
          community? As a class, talk about what you can do to improve.

          ●3 As a class, talk about the question of why character building is
          important, even if we are saved by faith alone in Jesus. If His
          righteousness, and His perfect character, are what saves us, then
          what do we need to develop character for?

          ●
          4 Helen Keller, who was deaf and blind from an early age, wrote,
          “Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through
          experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened,
          vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved.”
          —Leadership, vol. 17, no. 4. Do you agree? Discuss the relation-
          ships between character, suffering, and the great controversy.

Midnight Taxi
by ILIYANA MARINKOVA
   My husband and I live in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria. We are get-
ting old; I am partially disabled, and my husband isn’t too well either. Late
one night we received a telephone call to come to my husband’s village
right away. There was a family problem. We got up and dressed and hur-
ried to catch the last tram that would take us to the edge of Sofia.
   It was near midnight when we climbed off the tram and started to walk
the two and a half miles (four kilometers) to the village. You can imagine
what it looked like—these two old people hobbling along an empty road
in the middle of the night.
   We got about halfway to the village and felt that we just could not go
any farther. We knew it was not safe to stay along the road, but we were
tired. We knelt down and asked God to help us get to the village. Then we
got up and started walking again. We heard car brakes behind us, and a car
rolled to a stop beside us. The driver rolled down his window and asked,
“Are you the people who called me to take you to Mirovyane?”
   We were surprised, for we had no telephone with us to call anyone, but
this man knew that we were going to Mirovyane.
   “Never mind,” he said in a gentle voice. “If you wish, get in and I will
take you to your destination.”
   We climbed into this man’s car and rode to the village. The man said
nothing as he drove the short distance to the village. He stopped at a bus
stop in the village quite near our destination. We thanked the man and
climbed out, relieved that we did not have to walk those last two kilome-
ters. We started down the street toward our relatives’. Behind us we heard
the car tires squeal as the driver turned around. We turned to wave our
thanks, but the street was empty. We saw no taillights, no dust in the road
to indicate that a car had been there.
   “He’s gone,” I told my husband. “He just disappeared.” I walked back to
where the man had let us off, but there was no sign of this man or his car.
   We don’t know whether this man was an angel or a human sent by God
to rescue two tired old people from an isolated road on a dark night.

      Extreme Heat




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 22, Job 1:6–2:10,
      Isa. 43:1–7, Hos. 2:1–12, 2 Cor. 11:23–29.

Memory Text: “Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has
      put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He
      shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of
      the Lord shall prosper in His hand” (Isaiah 53:10, NKJV).

               s the wife of the famous Christian writer C. S. Lewis was dying,

      A        Lewis wrote, “Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing
               to believe in God. The real danger is of coming to believe such
      dreadful things about Him. The conclusion I dread is not ‘So there’s no
      God after all’, but ‘So this is what God’s really like.’ ”—A Grief
      Observed (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1961), pp. 6, 7.
         When things become really painful, some of us reject God com-
      pletely. For others like Lewis, there is the temptation to change our
      view of God and imagine all sorts of bad things about Him. The ques-
      tion is, Just how hot can it get? How much heat is God willing to risk
      putting His people through in order to bring about His ultimate pur-
      pose of shaping us into the “likeness of his Son”? (Rom. 8:29, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: Why do you think God is willing
      to risk being misunderstood by those He wants to know and love
      Him? How much do you think God is willing to be misunderstood
      in order to mold you into the “likeness of his Son”?

     Abraham in the Crucible
Read Genesis 22. Out of nowhere and without explanation, God sud-
     denly calls Abraham to offer his own child as a burnt offering.
     Can you imagine how Abraham must have felt? On a human level,
     it was a totally revolting idea for a holy God to request that you
     sacrifice your own son. On a spiritual level, even if Abraham
     thought that this was acceptable, what about God’s promises of an
     inheritance? Without his son, the promise would be gone.

Why did God ask Abraham to offer this sacrifice? If God knows
     everything, what was the point?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        God’s request and its timing were not random. Indeed, the test was
     calculated to exert the deepest possible anguish, for “God had
     reserved his last, most trying test for Abraham until the burden of
     years was heavy on him, and he longed for rest.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 147. Was this the test of a mad God? Not
     at all, for “the agony which he endured during the dark days of that
     fearful trial was permitted that he might understand from his own
     experience something of the greatness of the sacrifice made by the
     infinite God for man’s redemption.”—Page 154.
        This was just a test—God never intended for Abraham to kill his
     son. This highlights something very important about the way God
     sometimes works. God may ask us to do something that He never
     intends for us to complete. He may ask us to go somewhere He never
     intends for us to arrive at. What is important to God is not necessarily
     the end, but what we learn as we are reshaped by the process.
        Jesus may have been thinking about Abraham’s experience when He
     said to the Jews, “ ‘Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of
     seeing my day; he saw it and was glad’ ” (John 8:56, NIV). Abraham
     could have missed out on this insight, dismissing the instructions as
     from Satan. The key to Abraham’s surviving and learning through the
     whole process was his knowing God’s voice.

      How do you know the voice of God? How do you know when
      God is talking to you? What are the ways He communicates His
      will to you?




                                                                         39

     Wayward Israel
        The story of Hosea has some powerful lessons to teach us. Hosea’s
     situation is remarkable. His wife, Gomer, runs away and has children
     with other men. Though she is sleeping around, God calls Hosea to take
     his wife back and fully show his love to her again. This story is meant
     as a parable about God and Israel. Israel had left God and were prosti-
     tuting themselves spiritually to other gods, but God still loved them and
     wanted to show His love to them. But just look at God’s methods!

Read Hosea 2:1–12. What methods does God say He will use to pull
     Israel back to Himself? What would these experiences have felt
     like?

     vs. 10
     ____________________________________________________________________

       This story raises two important issues about the way we experience
     God when He is bringing us to repentance.
       First, we risk not recognizing that God is at work. When Israel went
     through such hard and painful experiences, it might have been hard for
     them to recognize that their God was working for their salvation.
     When our path is blocked by sharp thorns or we are walled in so we
     don’t know where we are going (vs. 6)—is this God? When our basic
     necessities disappear or we are embarrassed (vss. 9, 10)—could our
     Father be in the middle of it all? The truth is that whatever we feel,
     God is always working to bring us to repentance, because He loves us
     so very much.
       Second, we risk misunderstanding God when He is at work. We may
     recognize that God is at work, but we don’t like what He’s doing.
     While we are feeling hurt and embarrassed, it is easy to blame God for
     being cruel, for not intervening, or for not caring. But God is always
     working to renew us through His covenant of love.
      Read Hosea 2:14–23. What does this passage reveal about God?
      Ask the Holy Spirit to show you if you have been running from
      God in any area of your life. If you are convicted that you have
      been, why wait to go through the crucible? What’s stopping you
      from surrendering all to the Lord?

      Surviving Through Worship
Read Job 1:6–2:10. What caused Job’s suffering?


         There is something astonishing here. The angels come to see God,
      and Satan comes with them. God asks Satan where he has been, and
      Satan replies that he has been “ ‘roaming through the earth and going
      back and forth in it’ ” (vs. 7, NIV). Then God poses this question:
      “ ‘Have you considered my servant Job?’ ” (vs. 8, NIV). The question
      itself is not remarkable; what is remarkable is the One who asks it. It
      isn’t Satan who points out Job as a subject for examination, but God.
      Knowing exactly what is going to follow, God calls Job to Satan’s atten-
      tion. Down on the earth, Job has absolutely no idea how hot his crucible
      is about to become. And though it’s very clear that it is Satan, not God,
      who causes Job’s suffering, it is also clear that it is God who gives His
      explicit permission for Satan to destroy Job’s possessions, children, and
      his own physical health. If God is giving permission for Job to suffer,
      what difference does it make whether God or Satan is personally inflict-
      ing the suffering? How can God be righteous and holy when He actively
      allows Satan to cause Job such pain? Is this situation a special case, or
      is it characteristic of the way God still deals with us today?

In Job 1:20, 21, how does Job respond to the trials?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        It is possible to respond to such suffering in two ways. We can
      become bitter and angry, turning our backs on a God we believe to be
      cruel or nonexistent, or we can hang on to God more tightly. Job deals
      with his catastrophe by staying in God’s presence and worshiping Him.
        In Job 1:20, 21, we see three aspects of worship that may help when
      in anguish. First, Job accepts his helplessness and recognizes that he
      has no claim to anything: “ ‘Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
      and naked I will depart’ ” (vs. 21, NIV). Second, Job acknowledges
      that God is still in total control: “ ‘The Lord gave and the Lord has
      taken away’ ” (vs. 21, NIV). Third, Job concludes by reasserting his
      belief in the righteousness of God. “ ‘May the name of the Lord be
      praised’ ” (vs. 21, NIV).

      Surviving Through Hope
        “We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure,
      so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, in our hearts we felt the
      sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on our-
      selves but on God, who raises the dead” (2 Cor. 1:8, 9, NIV).

        As God’s chosen apostle, Paul had endured more than most people.
      Yet, Paul was not crushed. Rather, he grew in his praise for God.
      Read his list of hardships in 2 Corinthians 11:23–29. Now read
      2 Corinthians 1:3–11.

In verse 4, Paul states that the reason for receiving God’s compassion
      and comfort is “so that we can comfort those in any trouble with
      the comfort we ourselves have received from God” (NIV). To what
      extent might suffering be a call to ministry? How could we become
      more alert to this possibility?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         God wants to minister through us to hurting people. This means that
      He may first allow us to experience the same sort of hurts. Then we’ll
      offer encouragement, not from theory but from our own experience of
      the compassion and comfort of God. This is a principle from Jesus’
      life (see Heb. 4:15).
         Paul’s vivid descriptions of his hardships are not to make us feel
      sorry for him. They are for us to know that even when we’re in the
      depths, the Father still can intervene to bring His compassion and
      comfort. We may despair even of our own lives, and even be killed, but
      fear not, God is teaching us to rely on Him. We can trust Him, for our
      God “raises the dead” (2 Cor. 1:9, NIV).
         As Paul continues to set his eyes on proclaiming the gospel, he
      knows that God will rescue him in the future as well. Paul’s ability to
      remain firm is supported by three things he mentions in 2 Corinthians
      1:10, 11. First, God’s proven track record: “He has delivered us from
      such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us” (vs. 10, NIV). Second,
      Paul’s determination to fix his concentration on God Himself: “On
      him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us” (vs. 10,
      NIV). Third, the saints’ continual intercession: “as you help us by your
      prayers” (vs. 11, NIV).

       What can you learn from Paul that can help you from falling
       into self-pity amid your own struggles?

     Extreme Heat
        So far this quarter, we have considered many examples of the cru-
     cibles that God uses to bring purity and Christlikeness to our lives.
     However, some people may view these examples and conclude that
     God is a severe and demanding taskmaster. Sure, some may say, “We
     know that God wants something good for us, but these examples don’t
     reveal much care and love. Instead, God looks more like a bully. He
     sets out on a purpose that causes us considerable hard times, and
     there’s nothing we can do about it.”
        It’s true that while living on this sin-filled earth, we will understand
     only a little of why things happen. In heaven we’ll understand so much
     more (1 Cor. 4:5, 13:12), but for now we will have to live with the ten-
     sion of believing that God is present and caring for us, even though
     things don’t always feel too good. Isaiah describes this tension very
     well.
        Read Isaiah 43:1–7. In verses 2 and 3, God says that His people will
     pass through waters and through fire. These are figurative of extreme
     dangers, but perhaps they hint at the crossing of the Red Sea and the
     Jordan, both fearful times but times that paved the way to a new life.
     You may expect that God might say that He would protect His people
     from these dangers, that He will guide them along an easier route. But
     like the Shepherd in Psalm 23, He rather says that when the difficult
     times come, God’s people need not be overwhelmed—for He is with
     them.

Look back at Isaiah 43:1–7. Write down the different ways in which
     God assures His people of comfort during the times of water and
     fire. What picture of God does this paint in your mind? Which
     promises can you claim for yourself?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        We could summarize what we have learned about God’s crucibles in
     three ways. First, God’s extreme heat is to destroy not us but our sin.
     Second, God’s extreme heat is not to make us miserable but to make
     us pure, as we were created to be. Third, God’s care for us through all
     things is constant and tender—He will never leave us alone, no mat-
     ter what happens to us.

      What do these texts teach you about the actions and character
      of God? Ps. 103:13, 14; Matt. 28:20; 1 Cor. 10:13; 1 Pet. 1:7. How
      have you experienced the reality of these verses in your own life?


                                                                            43

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Test of Faith,” pp. 145–
         155, in Patriarchs and Prophets; “Praise Ye the Lord,” pp. 315–319, in
         Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5.

           “God has always tried His people in the furnace of affliction. It is in
         the heat of the furnace that the dross is separated from the true gold of
         the Christian character. Jesus watches the test; He knows what is
1
         needed to purify the precious metal, that it may reflect the radiance of
         His love. It is by close, testing trials that God disciplines His servants.
         He sees that some have powers which may be used in the advancement
         of His work, and He puts these persons upon trial; in His providence
         He brings them into positions that test their character. . . . He shows
         them their own weakness, and teaches them to lean upon Him. . . . Thus
2
         His object is attained. They are educated, trained, and disciplined, pre-
         pared to fulfill the grand purpose for which their powers were given
         them.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 129, 130.
           “If in the providence of God we are called upon to endure trials, let
         us accept the cross and drink the bitter cup, remembering that it is a
         Father’s hand that holds it to our lips. Let us trust Him in the darkness
         as well as in the day. Can we not believe that He will give us every-
         thing that is for our good?. . . Even in the night of affliction how can
3
         we refuse to lift heart and voice in grateful praise, when we remember
         the love to us expressed by the cross of Calvary?”—Ellen G. White,
         Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 316.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 In class, have someone recount his or her own test of faith such
          as Abraham had. What can you learn from this person’s experi-
          ence, from his or her successes or failures?

          ●2 Review the last 24 hours of Christ’s life. What extremes did He
          face? How did He endure? What principles can we take from His
          example and apply for ourselves when in the midst of our own
          crucible?

          ●3 Discuss the idea, touched on this week, about how through our
          own suffering we can minister to others who are suffering.
          However true it might be, what are some of the problems we
          might encounter with this idea?

          ●
          4 Ellen White wrote above: “Let us trust Him in the darkness as
          well as in the day.” That’s easier said than done. How can we help
          each other develop the kind of faith that will enable us to do just
          that? Why is it important to trust God in the bad times?

God Saved Me Twice
by KIZITO KYAKULAGA
   Before I knew God, He knew me and saved me. I was studying in a gov-
ernment secondary boarding school near my town in Uganda. At the end
of the year I was preparing for my O-level exams when I became very sick.
The nurse put me in a spare room to rest, and I fell asleep.
   As I slept, the candle the nurse had left fell over, catching the room on
fire. I awoke smelling smoke but was too weak to even stand, but some-
one rushed in and pulled me from the burning room. Everything in the
room was burned, but I was saved.
   I was still ill when I took my exams, but when the results came back I
had passed. Later I received a letter from Bugema Secondary School,
offering me a scholarship to study the A level, the college entrance level.
I was so happy, because my parents could not afford to send me on to
school.
   But when I arrived at Bugema, I discovered that the school was Seventh-
day Adventist. Students worshiped on Saturday, but Sunday was a workday.
We had worship every morning and even had Bible class every day! This
was too much religion for me! I thought about going home, but I decided
to stick it out. Soon I realized it wasn’t so bad after all. Teachers helped
me understand what the Bible meant, and I learned more in a week than I
had learned in a year in my home church.
   During the Week of Prayer I gave my life to Jesus. I had attended church
all my life, but no one had ever invited me to accept Jesus as my Lord. I
was baptized later in the year, but I did not tell my parents right away, for
I feared they would be angry.
   When I did tell my parents, they were not so angry, just disappointed.
My father threatened to withhold the small allowance he had been send-
ing me to buy soap and stuff, but Mother saw to it that I still received it.
My mother listens when I talk to her about what I believe, and I invite her
and my younger sister to attend church with me. I hope someday my little
sister can study at Bugema and find there what I found—a relationship
with Jesus.
   Your mission offerings support schools such as Bugema Secondary
School and Bugema University in Uganda. Your faithfulness helped intro-
duce me to Jesus. Thank you.

      Struggling With All
      Energy


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 32; Matt. 5:29;
      John 16:5–15; Col. 1:28, 29; 1 Pet. 1:13.

Memory Text: “To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy,
      which so powerfully works in me” (Colossians 1:29, NIV).

             man and woman sat together on a talk show. Both had experi-

      A      enced the murder of a child. The woman’s son had been mur-
             dered 20 years before, and her anger and bitterness were as
      great as ever. The man was totally different. His daughter had been
      murdered by a terrorist a few years earlier. He spoke about forgiveness
      toward the killers and about how God had transformed his hurt.
      However terrible the pain, this man had become an illustration of how
      God can bring healing to the darkest moments of our lives.
        How can two people respond so differently? How does spiritual
      change occur in the life of the Christian, enabling us to mature
      through life’s crucibles rather than being completely overwhelmed by
      them?

The Week at a Glance: What is the role of our wills, and
      willpower, in the battle with self and sin? How can we avoid the
      trap of letting our feelings rule the decisions we make? Why must
      we persevere and not give up when in the crucible?

     The Spirit of Truth
        Have you ever prayed, “Please, God, make me good!” but little
     seems to change? How is it possible that we can pray for God’s great
     transforming power to work within us, but our lives seem to remain
     the same? We know that God has unlimited supernatural resources
     that He so eagerly and freely offers us. We really want to take advan-
     tage of it all, and yet, our lives don’t seem to change in a way that
     matches what God is offering.
        Why? One reason is disturbingly simple: While the Spirit has
     unlimited power to transform us, it is possible to restrict by our own
     choices what God can do.

Read John 16:5–15. In this passage, Jesus calls the Holy Spirit the
     “Spirit of truth” (vs. 13, NIV). What does this imply that the Holy
     Spirit does for us?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        While the Holy Spirit can bring us the truth about our sinfulness, He
     cannot make us repent. He can also show us the greatest truth about
     God, but He cannot force us to believe or obey it. If God did compel
     us in even the slightest way, we would lose our free will, and Satan
     would accuse God of manipulating our minds and hearts and thus be
     able to accuse God of cheating in the great controversy. When the
     great controversy broke out in heaven, our Father did not compel
     Satan or any of the angels to believe that He was good and just or
     compel the angels to repent. And in the Garden of Eden, when so
     much was at stake again, God made the truth about the tree in the mid-
     dle of the Garden very clear but did not prevent Eve and Adam from
     exercising their free will to disobey. God will not act any differently
     with us today. So, the Spirit presents the truth about God and sin and
     then says, “In view of what I have shown you, what will you do now?”
        It is the same when we are in the crucible. Sometimes the crucible
     is there precisely because we have not obeyed or repented of our sins.
     For our Father to work in such cases, we must consciously choose to
     open the doors of repentance and obedience in order for God’s power
     to enter through and transform us.

      What convictions has the “Spirit of truth” brought to you
      recently? How well are you listening to His voice? And, most
      important, what choices are you making with your free will?



                                                                         47

     The Divine-Human Combination
       What is your greatest accomplishment ever? Chances are, whatever
     you achieved did not happen simply by rolling out of bed in the morn-
     ing. If we want to achieve something worthwhile in this life, it takes
     time and effort. Our discipleship to Christ is no different.

Read Colossians 1:28, 29. Though Paul talks about God working in
     him, in what ways does he show the human effort also involved?
     See also Deut. 4:4, Luke 13:24, 1 Cor. 9:25, Heb. 12:4.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        In Colossians 1:29 there is a very interesting insight into the way
     Paul sees his relationship with God in this work. He says that he is
     struggling—but with the power of God.
        The word for “labor” means to “grow weary,” to “work to the point
     of exhaustion.” This word was used particularly of athletes as they
     trained. The word for “struggle,” which comes next, can mean in some
     languages “to agonize.” So, we have the word picture of an athlete
     straining with everything to win. But then Paul adds a twist to the
     idea, because Paul is not straining with everything he has but with
     everything that God gives him. So, we are left with a simple conclu-
     sion about Paul’s ministry—it was a ministry done with great personal
     effort and discipline but done with God’s power. This relationship
     works in exactly the same way as we pursue the development of
     Christ’s character in us.
        This is important to remember because we live in a world in which
     we want more and more with less and less effort. That idea has crept
     into Christianity, too. Some Christian evangelists promise that if you
     just believe, the Holy Spirit will fall upon you with amazing super-
     natural power and perform great miracles. But this can be a dangerous
     half-truth, because it can lead people to the conclusion that we just
     need to wait for God’s power to come while sitting comfortably in our
     seats!

      What is your own experience with the kind of striving Paul
      talked about? What things has God laid upon your heart that
      you are struggling with? How can you learn to surrender to
      God’s will?

     The Disciplined Will
        One of the greatest enemies of our wills is our own feelings. We are
     increasingly living in a culture bombarded with pictures and music
     that can appeal directly to our senses, triggering our emotions—anger,
     fear, or lust—without us realizing it. How often do we think such
     things as “What do I feel like eating for supper?” “What do I feel like
     doing today?” “Do I feel good about buying this?” Feelings have thus
     become intimately involved in our decision-making. Feelings are not
     necessarily bad, but how I feel about something may have little to do
     with what is right or best. Indeed, our feelings can lie to us (“The heart
     is deceitful above all things” [Jer. 17:9].) and can create a false pic-
     ture of reality, causing us to make bad choices, setting us up for a cru-
     cible of our own making.

What examples can you find from the Bible where people made choices
     based on feelings rather than on God’s Word? What were the con-
     sequences? See, for example, Gen. 3:6; 2 Sam. 11:3, 4; Gal. 2:11, 12.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

Read 1 Peter 1:13. What is Peter concerned about, and what does he
     want his readers to actually do?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Peter understood that the mind is the rudder for the body that we
     control. Take away the control of the mind, and we will be controlled
     by whatever feelings blow our way. Imagine walking along a narrow
     path to the Shepherd’s home. Along the way there are many paths
     leading in different directions. Some of these paths go to places that
     we would not want to visit. Others look tempting; they appeal to our
     feelings, our emotions, our desires. If, though, we take any one of
     them, we get off the right path and go in a way that might be exceed-
     ingly difficult to get off.

      What important decisions are you facing? Ask yourself hon-
      estly, “How can I know if I am basing my choices on feeling,
      emotion, or desire, as opposed to the Word of God?”




                                                                           49

      Radical Commitment
        “If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it
      away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for
      your whole body to be thrown into hell” (Matt. 5:29, NIV).

Dwell on the words of Jesus in the above text.Would you call them radi-
      cal? If so, why?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Radical action is necessary not because God has made the Christian
      life difficult, but because we and our culture have drifted so far away
      from God’s plans for us. People often wake up and wonder to them-
      selves, “How could I have gone so far away from God?” The answer
      is always the same: just one step at a time.
         Read Matthew 5:29, 30. Jesus is speaking in the context of sexual
      sin. However, the underlying principles apply to dealing with other
      sin, as well. Indeed, the principles can apply to our growth in Christ in
      general.

What crucial point is Jesus telling us with those words? Are we really
      called to literally maim ourselves?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Jesus isn’t calling us to physically harm our bodies—not at all!
      Rather, He is calling us to control our minds and therefore our bodies,
      no matter the cost. Notice that the text does not say that we should
      pray and that God will instantly remove the sinful tendencies from our
      lives. Sometimes God may graciously do this for us, but often He calls
      us to make a radical commitment to give up something, or start doing
      something, that we may not feel like doing at all. What a crucible that
      can be! The more often we make the right choices, the stronger we
      will become and the weaker the power of temptation in our lives.
         God sometimes uses crucibles to catch our attention when there are
      so many noisy distractions around us. It is in the crucible that we real-
      ize how far we have drifted from God. The crucible may be God’s call
      for us to make a radical decision to return to our Father’s plan for us.

     The Need to Persevere
Read the story of Jacob wrestling with God (Genesis 32). What does
     this story say to us about perseverance, even amid great discour-
     agement? (Keep the whole context of Jacob’s situation in mind
     before you answer.)
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       We can know what is right and exercise our wills to do the right
     thing; but when we are under pressure, it can be very difficult to keep
     holding on to God and His promises. That’s because we are weak and
     fearful. Therefore, one of the important strengths of the Christian is
     perseverance, the ability to keep going despite wanting to give up.
       One of the greatest examples of perseverance in the Bible is Jacob.
     Many years before, Jacob had tricked his brother, Esau, and his father
     into giving him the birthright (Genesis 27), and ever since, he had
     been running in fear of Esau’s desire to kill him. Even though he had
     been given wonderful promises of God’s guidance and blessing in his
     dream of a ladder reaching to heaven (Genesis 28), he was still scared.
     Jacob was desperate for God’s assurance that he was accepted and that
     the promises made to him many years before were still true. As he
     fought someone who was actually Jesus, Jacob had his hip dislocated.
     From that point on, it could not have been possible to fight, as the pain
     would have been too excruciating. There must have been a subtle shift
     from fighting to hanging on. Jacob is hanging on to Jesus through
     unbearable pain until he receives an assurance of his blessing. So
     Jesus says to him, “ ‘Let me go, for it is daybreak’ ” (Gen. 32:26,
     NIV).
       Jacob’s blessing came because he held on through the pain. So it is
     with us. God may also dislocate our “hip” and then call us to hang on
     to Him through our pain. Indeed, God allowed the painful scars to
     continue—Jacob was still limping when he met his brother. To outside
     appearances it was a weakness, but for Jacob it was an indication of
     his strength.

      What are some practical choices you can make (associations,
      lifestyle, reading material, health habits, spiritual life) that will
      help you better persevere with the Lord amid discouragement
      and temptation?

            “This will, that forms so important a factor in the character of man,

         was at the Fall given into the control of Satan; and he has ever since
         been working in man to will and to do of his own pleasure, but to the
         utter ruin and misery of man.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
         Church, vol. 5, p. 515.
            “In order to receive God’s help, man must realize his weakness and
         deficiency; he must apply his own mind to the great change to be
2
         wrought in himself; he must be aroused to earnest and persevering
         prayer and effort. Wrong habits and customs must be shaken off; and
         it is only by determined endeavor to correct these errors and to con-
         form to right principles that the victory can be gained. Many never
         attain to the position that they might occupy, because they wait for
         God to do for them that which He has given them power to do for
         themselves. All who are fitted for usefulness must be trained by the
         severest mental and moral discipline, and God will assist them by
3
         uniting divine power with human effort.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs
         and Prophets, p. 248.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 To what extent do you think that we appreciate that our wills
          were “at the Fall given into the control of Satan”? How, by focus-
          ing on the character of Jesus, can we better appreciate just how
          fallen we are and how great God’s grace is toward us?

          ●
          2 Read the story of Jesus in Gethsemane (Matt. 26:36–43). What
          were Jesus’ own feelings and desires, as opposed to God’s will?
          What can we learn from this example?

          ●
          3 As a class, talk about the distinct things in your own culture
          that can work to break down our defenses and leave us more vul-
          nerable to Satan’s attacks. What can we do to help other church
          members be aware of these dangers, as well as help those who feel
          the need for help?

          ●4 Do you know someone in your church who hasn’t been there
          for quite a long time, who might be getting ready to give up or
          has already given up? What can you do as a group to encourage
          this person, to help him or her not turn away from Jesus? What
          practical things can you do to help?

Fighting for Faith
by ELIZABETH MURMU
   I live in Bangladesh. I learned early in life that if I wanted something, I
had to fight for it. And I wanted an education.
   My father did not want me to study. He wanted me to work in people’s
homes and help the family. But I wanted to learn. Sometimes I hid outside
the nearby school to listen to the teacher’s lessons.
   My elder sister, Sharoni, lived with an uncle who sent her to school. In
high school, she studied at Bangladesh Adventist Seminary and College
(BASC). There she became a Seventh-day Adventist, which angered my
parents. But Sharoni would not budge, and in time my parents allowed her
to return home. Sharoni found work as a tutor and helped the family finan-
cially.
   My parents were set against Sharoni’s religion. She challenged them to
study the Bible with her and tell her where Adventists were wrong. In time
they realized that Sharoni was right, but they refused to change their reli-
gion.
   Sharoni knew that the local school could not provide the quality of edu-
cation we children needed and urged my parents to send us to Adventist
schools. My father refused, so Sharoni decided to send us to study in an
Adventist school herself. When Father still refused, Sharoni told him,
“You do not have to pay a single rupee for their education. I will pay it all.”
Finally Father and Mother allowed my two sisters and me to study at
BASC, the Adventist school Sharoni had attended.
   I stayed at BASC through eighth grade, when Sharoni transferred us to
another Adventist school to study. She became dean of women at this
school and could look after us there.
   When each child in our family was ready to start school, Sharoni took
them to study at the Adventist school. Several more brothers and sisters
                               now study here. Only my youngest brother is
                               still at home with our parents. Soon he will
                               come to study at the Adventist school. Each
                               of us has given our hearts to Jesus, and when
                               we are old enough, we will be baptized.
                                  Thank you for your mission offerings,
                               which help make Adventist education possi-
                               ble in my country. It has made a big differ-
                               ence in my family!

      Indestructible Hope




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Job 38–41, Isa. 41:8–14,
      Jer. 29:1–10, Hab. 1:1–4, Heb. 12:1–13.

Memory Text: “And hope does not disappoint us, because God
      has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom
      he has given us” (Romans 5:5, NIV).

                 hen in church surrounded by smiling people, how easy it is

      W          to talk and sing about hope. But when we find ourselves
                 within the crucible, hope does not always seem so easy. As
      circumstances press around us, we begin to question everything, par-
      ticularly the wisdom of God.
         In one of his books, C. S. Lewis writes about a make-believe lion.
      Wanting to meet this lion, a person asks if the lion is safe. They’re told
      that he’s not safe, “but he’s good.”
         Even though we don’t always understand God and He seems to do
      unpredictable things, that doesn’t mean that God is against us. It sim-
      ply means that we don’t have the full picture yet. But we struggle with
      the idea that for us to have peace, confidence, and hope, God must be
      understandable and predictable. He needs to be, in our thinking,
      “safe.” As such, we set ourselves up for disappointment.

The Week at a Glance: How does our understanding of
      the character of God help us maintain hope in the crucible?

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, November 17.

     The Big Picture
       When we are hurting, it is very easy to presume that what happens
     to us is the only thing that matters. But there is a slightly larger pic-
     ture than just “me” (see Rev. 12:7, Rom. 8:22).

Read Habakkuk 1:1–4. What did Habakkuk face?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        You might expect that God would say something like “That’s really
     terrible, Habakkuk; let Me come and help you immediately.” But
     God’s answer is the opposite. He tells Habakkuk that it is going to get
     worse. Read this in Habakkuk 1:5–11.
        Israel had been taken into captivity by the Assyrians, but God prom-
     ises that worse is coming: The Babylonians will now carry away the
     people of Judah. Habakkuk cries out again in verses 12–17, and then
     waits to see what God is going to say.

How does God’s introduction to the promised destruction of Babylon
     in Habakkuk 2:2, 3 bring hope?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Habakkuk 2 is God’s promise of the destruction of the Babylonians.
     Hebrews 10:37 quotes Habakkuk 2:3, hinting of a messianic applica-
     tion to this promise in the future. With the same certainty that the
     destruction of Babylon was promised, so we also have the certainty of
     the destruction of “Babylon the Great” (Rev. 18:2, NIV).
        Habakkuk was trapped between the great evil surrounding him and
     God’s promise of worse to come. Yet, this is precisely where we find
     ourselves in salvation history. Great evil is around us, but the Bible
     predicts that much worse is to come. The key to Habakkuk’s survival
     was that he was brought to see the whole picture. Therefore, in chap-
     ter 3 he is able to pray an incredible prayer of praise because of what
     God will do in the future.

      Read Habakkuk 3:16–19. What does Habakkuk identify as his
      reasons for hope? What is the hope of God’s people as we wait
      for the last prophetic scenes to unfold? How can you make this
      hope your own?



                                                                          57
                M ONDAY November 12

      Who Our Father Is
        Oswald Chambers writes, “Have you been asking God what He is
      going to do? He will never tell you. God does not tell you what He is
      going to do; He reveals to you who He is.”—My Utmost for His
      Highest (Uhrichsville, Ohio: Barbour & Company, Inc., 1963), Jan. 2.

What do you think Chambers means by this idea?


         As we know, the book of Job begins with great personal tragedy for
      Job. He loses everything, except his life and his wife, and she suggests
      that he “ ‘curse God and die!’ ” (Job 2:9, NIV). What follows is a dis-
      cussion in which his friends try to work out why it has all happened.
      Throughout all of these discussions, God remains silent.
         Then suddenly in Job 38 God appears and speaks: “ ‘Who is this
      that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?’ ” (vs. 2,
      NIV). Without pausing, God asks Job about 60 jaw-dropping ques-
      tions. Open your Bible and scan through these in Job 38 and 39.
         After the last question, Job replies, “ ‘I am unworthy—how can I
      reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth. I spoke once, but I have
      no answer—twice, but I will say no more’ ” (Job 40:4, 5, NIV). But
      God is not finished. He then begins again and asks another set of
      “big” questions in succession.

Read Job’s final response in Job 42:1–6. What was God trying to tell
      Job, and what was the effect on him?


         God never answers any of the “why” questions of Job’s friends. But
      God does paint a picture of His unparalleled greatness as revealed
      through the astonishing works of creation. After this, Job certainly
      does not need any answers. The need for explanations has been
      eclipsed by an overwhelming picture of the magnificence of God.
         This story reveals a fascinating paradox. Hope and encouragement
      can spring from the realization that we know so little. Instinctively, we
      try to find comfort by knowing everything, and so we become dis-
      couraged when we cannot know. But sometimes God highlights our
      ignorance so that we may realize that human hope can only find secu-
      rity in a Being much greater than ourselves.

       Are things that you just can’t understand happening now? If so,
       focus on the character of God. How can doing that give you the
       hope that you need to persevere through what’s for now incom-
       prehensible?

      Our Father’s Presence
        “ ‘For I am the Lord, your God, who takes hold of your right
      hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you’ ” (Isa. 41:13,
      NIV).

        Someone once said, “When God seems far away, who is the one
      who has moved?” When problems strike, we presume that God has
      deserted us. The truth is that He hasn’t gone anywhere.
        God’s presence seemed very far away to the Jews in exile. Yet,
      through Isaiah God assures them of future deliverance. However,
      while the actual return to Jerusalem was still many years in the future,
      God wanted His people to know that He had not moved away from
      them and that there was every reason for hope.

Read Isaiah 41:8–14. What reasons for hope can you identify for peo-
      ple waiting eagerly for future deliverance? How does this promise
      help us as we wait for our exile on earth to end?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         One of the most powerful images in these texts is found in verse 13.
      The sovereign God of the universe says that His people do not need to
      fear, because He is the One who takes “ ‘hold of your right hand’ ”
      (NIV). It is one thing to imagine God guiding events on earth from a
      big throne light-years away from our earth. But it is an altogether dif-
      ferent picture to realize that He is close enough to hold the hands of
      His dearly beloved people.
         When we are busy, it can be hard to remember that God is so close
      to us. But when we do remember that He is Emmanuel, “God with us,”
      it makes such a difference. When God’s presence is with us, so are His
      purposes, His promises, and His transforming power.

       Over the next few days, try an experiment. At every moment
       possible, try to remind yourself that the God of the universe is
       close enough to you to hold your hand and is personally prom-
       ising you help. Keep a record of how this changes the way you
       live. Be prepared to discuss your experience in class on Sabbath.

     Our Father’s Plans for Us
       Everyone is looking for hope. But from where is it found? For some
     people, hope is found in the smile of a friend. For others, hope grows
     from financial security or a stable marriage. Where do you normally
     look for hope and courage?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       In the book of Jeremiah, the prophet is writing to people who had
     lost hope in their exile. “By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept
     when we remembered Zion” (Ps. 137:1, NIV). But even though they
     are heartbroken, Jeremiah lays out reasons why they should not give
     up hope.

What reasons for hope are given in Jeremiah 29:1–10?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       In this passage, there are three important sources of hope worth
     highlighting.
       First, God tells His people that they should not give up hope,
     because their situation is not the result of chance or unpredictable evil.
     For God Himself says, “I carried [Judah] into exile from Jerusalem to
     Babylon” (vs. 4, NIV). Though evil seems to surround them, Judah has
     never left the center of God’s hands.
       Second, God tells His people that they should not give up hope,
     because He can work even within their present difficulties. “ ‘Also,
     seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you
     into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will
     prosper’ ” (vs. 7, NIV).
       Third, God tells His people that they should not give up hope,
     because He is going to bring an end to their exile at a specific time.
     “This is what the Lord says: ‘When seventy years are completed for
     Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring
     you back to this place’ ” (vs. 10, NIV).
       After God explains how He was in charge of their past, is in charge
     of their present, and will be in charge of their future, He then beauti-
     fully conveys His tender care for His people (see vss. 11–14).

      Read verses 11–14, saying your name after the word you, as if God
      is making these promises to you personally. Apply these promises
      to yourself in whatever your present struggles might be.

     Our Father’s Discipline
Read Hebrews 12:5–13. What’s the message to us here, and how does
     it fit in with what we have been studying this quarter?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        In Hebrews 12:5–13, the author describes trials in the context of
     discipline. In the NIV Bible translation, the word discipline appears
     nearly ten times. In the Greek world, this word was the most basic
     word for education. So to understand discipline is to understand how
     God educates us in the school of faith that the author has been describ-
     ing before in Hebrews 11.
        Throughout Hebrews 11, the author has been painting pictures of
     men and women of faith. Their faith was what kept them going when
     they were faced with all sorts of trying situations. As we enter chap-
     ter 12, the author turns to us, the readers, and says that since so many
     people have persevered against incredible odds before us, we also can
     run and finish the life of faith. The key is to fix our eyes upon Jesus
     (vs. 2) that He may be an example when times are difficult (vs. 3).
     Reading chapter 12 is like being given a set of reading glasses.
     Without these glasses our vision or understanding of hardship will
     always be fuzzy. But if we look through these glasses, it will correct
     the blurred explanation of suffering that our culture presses upon us.
     Then we will be able to understand clearly and be able to respond to
     trials intelligently.

Read through the “glasses” of Hebrews 12:1–13. Now concentrate on
     verses 5–13. What is

     the source of discipline?

      Read through Hebrews 12:1–13 again. Make a list of all the rea-
      sons you can identify with as grounds for hope. How have you
      experienced this hope in your own times of spiritual “education”?




                                                                         61

         pp. 301–309, in Education; “Help in Daily Living,” pp. 470, 471, in The
         Ministry of Healing.

           “Into the experience of all there come times of keen disappointment
         and utter discouragement—days when sorrow is the portion, and it is
         hard to believe that God is still the kind benefactor of His earthborn
         children; days when troubles harass the soul, till death seems prefer-
         able to life. It is then that many lose their hold on God and are brought
1        into the slavery of doubt, the bondage of unbelief. Could we at such
         times discern with spiritual insight the meaning of God’s providences
         we should see angels seeking to save us from ourselves, striving to
         plant our feet upon a foundation more firm than the everlasting hills,
         and new faith, new life, would spring into being.”—Ellen G. White,
         Prophets and Kings, p. 162.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Ellen White says that “all” of us experience times of “keen dis-
          appointment and utter discouragement.” How well do we notice
          each other as we go through such times? How can we better learn
          to be agents of hope for each other when we experience such bit-
          ter disappointments?
3         ●
          2 As a class, go over your answers to Tuesday’s final question.
          What difference did it make in your life as you kept the reality of
          God’s nearness ever before you?

          ●3 In class, read aloud sections in Job 38–41. What kind of pic-
          ture of God does it present? What do you learn that gives you
          hope and encouragement? How does the Sabbath fit into this pic-
          ture? How does it help keep before us the nature and character
          of God?

          ●
          4 Hope that transforms comes from heaven. This means that we
          can pray for hope to be brought into each other’s lives. Spend some
          time praying for those whose hope has been faltering recently, that
          their hope may be renewed. More than that, what can you do for
          others who are in a losing struggle with hope?

          ●
          5 If someone is willing, ask that person to recount a time when
          despair and trials caused him or her to lose hope and faith. What
          turned that person around? What can we share with one another
          that can help when we are in times of doubt and despair?

The Lost Bank Card
by SHARON BRUNTON AND YUAMB
   It was Friday afternoon, and Yuamb, a literature evangelist, stood in line
at the bank in Papua New Guinea, waiting to withdraw money for bus fare
to return home. She reached into her bag to take out her bank card, but it
was not there. She found a Bible promise card instead. Worried, she
removed everything from her purse, but her bank card was not there.
   Frustrated, she complained to God. “Lord, how can You let this happen
to me on Friday afternoon? I have no money to get home, and there is no
time to sell books to earn some money for bus fare.” She read the prom-
ise card she held in her hand. “A righteous man may have many troubles,
but the Lord delivers him from them all” (Ps. 34:19, NIV).
   Yuamb bowed her head again and asked God what He wanted her to do.
Then she began walking. She passed several shops and turned down a side
street. She stopped before a nightclub, then stepped in, not sure who she
would meet there or what she would say.
   A young girl named Joyce greeted Yuamb as she entered. Yuamb intro-
duced herself as a literature evangelist, and the woman invited her to sit
down. Soon Yuamb was showing Joyce the books she had with her. “Are
you an Adventist?” Joyce asked. Surprised, Yuamb answered that she was.
   Joyce explained that she had once been an Adventist. She bought a
book, which provided Yuamb’s bus fare. “Please come back on Monday,”
Joyce asked, “and bring The Desire of Ages and The Great Controversy.”
   Yuamb left that nightclub rejoicing that God had led her to this hungry
soul in a place she might never have entered. Yuamb returned on Monday
with the books Joyce had asked for. Joyce introduced Yuamb to Roslyn,
who also bought several books, and several other young women in the club
who enrolled in Bible studies.
   When Yuamb returned to visit her new friends several weeks later, one
girl complained that her copy of The Desire of Ages had been stolen. She
ordered two more copies. Three months later the owner of the nightclub
turned the club into a restaurant, and is giving the girls Sabbaths off to
worship. Joyce and Roslyn and another friend are attending the Adventist
church in their area.
   Yuamb praises God for her lost bank card that led her to lost souls
searching for truth.




SHARON BRUNTON is a missionary in Papua New Guinea. YUAMB is a literature evangelist
living in Lae, Papua New Guinea.

      Seeing the Invisible




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 40:27–31, John 14:1–14,
      Rom. 8:28–39, Eph. 1:18–23.

Memory Text: “By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the
      wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible”
      (Hebrews 11:27, NKJV).

              he definition of faith in the book of Hebrews is always chal-

      T       lenging. “Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and cer-
              tain of what we do not see” (Heb. 11:1, NIV). How can we be
      sure about what we do not see? Yet, this is exactly what Moses illus-
      trates in our memory text: “He persevered because he saw him who is
      invisible” (vs. 27, NIV).
         It is even more challenging to realize that we are called to see “him
      who is invisible” not simply when times are good but especially when
      everything is going wrong. For this we need faith, a Christlike faith
      that must be shaped by the truth about God and God’s kingdom. The
      truth about our Father’s goodness, the power in the name of Jesus, the
      power of the resurrection, and the compassion of God are essential
      truths that will enable us to stand strong when we are in the crucible
      and may be tempted to doubt everything.

The Week at a Glance: What truths about God can help
      sustain us through even the worst situations?

     Our Father’s Extravagance
        “If God really loved me, He would certainly do _______
     ____________ for me!” I wonder how many times that thought has
     flickered through our minds. We look at our circumstances and then
     begin to wonder whether God really loves us, because if He really did,
     things would be different.
        There are two rationales that often lead us to doubt God’s goodness.
     First, when we have a burning desire in our hearts and minds for
     something that we believe is good, the idea that God might want
     something different for us may seem ridiculous. Second, we may
     doubt God’s goodness because our experience clashes with what we
     believe. If something looks good or feels good or sounds good or
     tastes good, then it must be good. And so we get angry with God when
     we can’t have it.
        This is where faith comes into play. Faith comes into action pre-
     cisely at those times we are tempted to doubt God and His goodness.

Romans 8:28–39 is a powerful passage that describes the goodness
     of God toward us. What reasons can you find in the text that can
     guard our minds against doubting God’s goodness?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        In verse 32 there is an important piece of logic that is extremely
     helpful in guarding us from becoming overwhelmed by our circum-
     stances. “If God didn’t hesitate to put everything on the line for us,
     embracing our condition and exposing himself to the worst by send-
     ing his own Son, is there anything else he wouldn’t gladly and freely
     do for us?” (The Message). How could we possibly think that God
     would send Jesus to die for us and then turn mean and stingy?
        This means that the truth of God’s generosity to us, seen in the death
     of Christ, must have a stronger impact in our thinking than all of the
     doubts that the crucible may generate inside us.

      How is it possible for a truth (God’s goodness) to have a more
      powerful effect on you than your doubts? Spend some time medi-
      tating on the truth that God has given Jesus to die in your place
      and that this incredible generosity continues in a thousand dif-
      ferent ways for you today. What does this do for your faith?




                                                                          65

     In the Name of Jesus
      “ ‘If you ask anything in My name, I will do it’ ” (John 14:14,
     NKJV).

        Jesus was not going to be with the disciples much longer. The One
     who had been their support and encouragement was going to heaven,
     and the disciples were beginning to feel confused and powerless. But
     although the disciples would not be able to physically see Him any
     longer, Jesus gave them a remarkable promise.
        Read John 14:1–14. According to verses 13 and 14, Jesus promises
     to do for us “anything” that we ask in His name. Because of this, we
     almost always add onto the end of our prayers, “In Jesus’ name,
     amen.”

When we say this, what do we normally think it means? What does
     Jesus mean when He encourages us to pray like this? What clues
     are there in these verses that help us to understand the point He’s
     making?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       When our request is “in the name of Jesus,” we can be certain that
     the whole machinery of heaven is at work on our behalf. We may not
     see the angels working all around us. But they are—sent from the
     throne of heaven in the name of Jesus, to fulfill our requests.
       Sometimes when we pray in the name of Jesus, we open our eyes
     and expect everything to be different around us—but it all looks the
     same. However, while the power of God may come with dramatic
     effect, as when Jesus calmed the storm, it may also come in quietness,
     unnoticed, as when the power of God sustained Jesus in Gethsemane.
     Something dramatic may not suddenly happen, but that doesn’t mean
     that God is not at work for us.

      Read again John 14:1–14. As you read, imagine that Jesus is
      talking directly to you, face to face. What hope and encourage-
      ment can you draw from these promises? At the same time, ask
      yourself, “What things in my life could be standing in the way
      of having these promises fulfilled for me? What changes must I
      purpose in my heart to do?”

     The Power of the Resurrection
        The Resurrection addresses the problem of human powerlessness.
     When we think about the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, we
     often think about how the death of Jesus was the event that made us
     legally right with God. And that is, of course, true.
        However, the Resurrection adds a specific dimension to salvation.
     The resurrection of Jesus is meaningful not just because it shows us
     that one day we will be resurrected, as well. The Resurrection placed
     Jesus at the right hand of the Father in a position of power and author-
     ity. This resurrection power is the same power that God makes avail-
     able for us today!

In Ephesians 1:18–23, Paul talks about the power of God. What does
     this text teach us about the power of the Resurrection? What hope
     and promises for yourself can you find in these verses?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Paul is praying that the Ephesians understand a few things that can
     be understood properly only with divine help: (1) that there is the hope
     of transformation and an eternal future to which Jesus has called us;
     (2) that we understand the power that was manifested in our behalf.
       Paul then tries to describe how astonishing this power is. The power
     that is available to us today is the same power that resurrected Jesus
     not just out of the ground and back to life but to the place of power at
     the Father’s right hand.
       But Paul doesn’t stop there. The Resurrection didn’t simply give
     Jesus just any sort of power but the power to rule and provide every
     possible thing His people could ever need—for all eternity!

      Make a list of the areas in your life where you need the power of
      the resurrected Jesus. When you have finished, pray that this
      power will be applied to all these areas of need. At the same
      time, what can you do better, what choices can you make, that
      can allow this power to work more freely in your life?

      To Carry All Our Worry
        There is a plaque that some people have in their homes that reads
      “Why pray when you can worry?” It makes us laugh because we know
      how often we worry rather than come to God and give Him our con-
      cerns.
        Someone once said that when our life becomes all tied up, give it to
      God and let Him untie the knots. How God must long to do this for
      us. Yet, amazingly we manage to hang on to our problems until we are
      about to snap. Why do we wait until we are desperate before we go to
      the Lord?

Read 1 Peter 5:7. Peter is quoting Psalm 55:22. What’s the basic mes-
      sage here for us? See also Matt. 6:25–33.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         It is a very simple text. There is no secret hidden in it, and it means
      exactly what it says. To cast means to do just that, to throw, to give
      away, so that what is causing the aching and the concern no longer has
      any connection to you. But, of course, our burdens are not just thrown
      anywhere. Our worry does not disappear into a void. It is given to our
      Father in heaven, who promises to sort it out. That’s what Jesus is
      telling us in the verses in Matthew. The problem in doing this is not
      that it’s hard; rather, it’s that it just seems too easy, too good to be true.
         Anxiety is caused by all sorts of reasons. It could be pressure from
      work. Unexpected criticism. Feeling that we are unwanted or unloved.
      Health or financial worries. Feeling that we are not good enough for
      God. Believing that we are not forgiven.
         Whatever they are, one reason why we hang on to our problems is
      that we think we can sort them out better than anyone else. But Peter
      urges us to reconsider any such idea. The reason we don’t have to
      worry is that God cares. But does God still care enough to intervene
      when a divorce is looming or we feel totally useless? The Bible says
      that He cares enough to transform any situation.

       What are things that cause you worry now? However legitimate
       they are, however troublesome they are, is there anything too
       hard for the Lord? Maybe our biggest problem is that even
       though we believe that God knows about it and can fix it, we
       don’t believe that He will resolve it the way we would like it
       resolved. Dwell on that last point and ask yourself how true it is
       in your own life.

     Still Faithful When God
     Cannot Be Seen
       To think that no one cares about what is happening to us is very
     unpleasant. But to think that God does not know or care about us can
     be most distressing.
       To the Judeans exiled in Babylon, God did not seem to care much
     about their situation. They were still exiled, still feeling abandoned by
     God because of their sin. But Isaiah speaks words of comfort to them.
     Isaiah 40 is a beautiful passage in which Isaiah speaks so tenderly to
     the people about their God: “He tends his flock like a shepherd: he
     gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he
     gently leads those that have young” (vs. 11, NIV). But after so long,
     the exiles were thinking, Where are You, O Lord? We can’t see any evi-
     dence that You are still there—or care!

Read Isaiah 40:27–31. In what ways does Isaiah describe God? How
     is this description of God meant to answer their belief that “ ‘My
     way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my
     God?’ ” (vs. 27, NIV).
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Another group of people who might have considered that their way
     was hidden from God is found in the book of Esther. In this book, God
     is not mentioned even once. However, the whole story is an unfolding
     drama of God’s intervention to save His people from an irrevocable
     law to have them destroyed. Not only does this story describe the
     events of the past, but it symbolizes a time in the future during which
     God’s people will again be persecuted and a law again introduced for
     their destruction (Rev. 13:15). Can you imagine how easy it would be
     to conclude that if such terrible circumstances were existing, God
     must surely have deserted His people? But we are not to fear. The
     same God who saved His chosen ones in the story of Esther will save
     them again in the final crisis.

      We have read how Isaiah described God to the exiles. How
      would you describe God to people who felt that God had disap-
      peared and abandoned them? How would you teach them to see
      through the eyes of faith and not be dependent on what they see
      around them with their human eyes?




                                                                          69

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “In the Days of Queen
         Esther,” pp. 598–606, in Prophets and Kings.

            “Has not God said He would give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
         Him? And is not this Spirit a real, true actual guide? Some men seem
         afraid to take God at His word, as though it would be presumption in
         them. They pray for the Lord to teach us and yet are afraid to credit the
         pledged word of God and believe we have been taught of Him. So long
         as we come to our heavenly Father humbly and with a spirit to be
1
         taught, willing and anxious to learn, why should we doubt God’s ful-
         fillment of His own promise? You must not for a moment doubt Him
         and dishonor Him thereby. When you have sought to know His will,
         your part in the operation with God is to believe that you will be led
         and guided and blessed in the doing of His will. We may mistrust our-
         selves lest we misinterpret His teachings, but make even this a subject
2
         of prayer, and trust Him, still trust Him to the uttermost, that His Holy
         Spirit will lead you to interpret aright His plans and the working of His
         providence.”—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 6, p. 225.
            “Faith grows strong by coming in conflict with doubts and oppos-
         ing influences. The experience gained in these trials is of more value
         than the most costly jewels.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
         Church, vol. 3, p. 555.

    Discussion Questions:

          ●
          1 As a class, talk about the kinds of things we believe in that we
          do not see, things that we know are real yet are beyond our sight.
          How can this help us understand what it means to see “Him who
          is invisible”?

          ●
          2 Discuss the final question found at the end of Wednesday’s les-
          son. How often do we find ourselves in that situation? What can
          we do that will better enable us to trust that the Lord’s way is the
          best, even if it’s not what we want?

          ●3 If “faith grows strong by coming in conflict with doubts and
          opposing influences” and this leads to something extremely valu-
          able—“of more value than the most costly jewels”—how should
          this shape the way we look at such conflicts?

Faithful Above All
by JEAN RÉNÉ SI SI
   It is difficult being the only Adventist in my family, but God has gently
showed me how to honor His holy commandments, especially the
Sabbath.
   I am studying in a technical school in Cameroon, and some of the tests
fell on Sabbaths. The teachers gave me a zero for missed exams. Then one
of our final exams was scheduled for Sabbath. I knew if I missed that
exam I would have to take the entire year over. But I was determined to
honor God’s Sabbath.
   I did not tell my parents about the Sabbath exam, but my classmates
knew. And when I did not come for the exam, they went to my house to
find out where I was. When my parents learned that I had skipped an exam
and would have to take the year over, they were upset.
   I repeated the entire year of school, and exams again fell on Sabbath.
My teachers and principal asked me if I would sit for the exam that year,
and I told them that I would not take any exam on Sabbath. I would trust
in God to help me, and if I failed again, so be it. One teacher rescheduled
his exams for another day, but other teachers asked, “How can religion be
so important as to jeopardize your future?” I told them I trusted that God
would work out the details so that I could pass the course.
   The second year one of the final exams was scheduled for Sabbath. I felt
pressure to take the exam, so on Sabbath morning I hurried out of town so
that I would not be tempted to take the exam.
   When the exam results were posted, I did not want to look at the results,
for surely I had failed. But the school called me in for another reason, and
I heard that I had passed. I was amazed! Even the teacher was amazed and
asked how I could have passed when I had not taken two of the exams. I
told the teacher that God had done it.
   “Your God is very powerful,” the teacher confided. “In all my years of
teaching I have never seen such a thing happen.”
   My parents are not yet interested in how God is blessing me, but my
brother and sisters are. My brother has taken his stand for God, and two of
my sisters are studying the Bible with me.
   I praise God for helping me remain faithful in difficult times.
   Your mission offerings teach young people how to remain faithful to
God in difficult times. Thank you for your faithfulness.

      A Life of Praise




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Josh. 5:13–6:20, 2 Chron.
      20:1–30, Psalm 145, Acts 16:16–34, Phil. 4:4–7.

Memory Text: “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again:
      Rejoice!” (Philippians 4:4, NIV).

          t’s always easy to shout with joy to the Lord when we feel joy. It’s

      I   not so easy, however, when things are bad, when we are in the
          worst situations imaginable, when the crucible tightens. Yet, it’s
      precisely then that we need, perhaps, more than ever to praise God, for
      praise is a means of helping us sustain faith.
        Indeed, praise can transform even our darkest circumstances, maybe
      not in the sense of its changing the facts around us, but in the sense
      that it can change us, and those around us, in a way that helps us face
      challenges.
        Praise is faith in action. It may not always be natural to us, but when
      we practice praise so that it becomes a natural part of our lives, it has
      the power both to convert and conquer.

The Week at a Glance: What is praise? How could praise
      be such a powerful spiritual weapon in difficult circumstances?
      How can praise transform us and the situation around us?

     Framework for Praise
       The great Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevski had been sentenced to
     death, only to have the sentence commuted at the last moment. He
     spent years in prison instead. Talking about his prison experience, he
     wrote: “Believe to the end, even if all men go astray and you are left
     the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise God in
     your loneliness.”
       In these lessons we have already seen how Paul endured incredible
     opposition and persecution. But now he is sitting in a Roman prison.
     But he is not depressed; instead, he is eagerly writing to encourage the
     believers in Philippi!

Read Philippians 4:4–7. How do you think Paul could have written
     such things when he himself was sitting in a prison? What are the
     keys in this verse to gaining the “peace of God”?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        It is one thing to rejoice when everything is going well. But Paul
     exhorts us to rejoice always. That may sound strange. If we take what
     Paul writes literally, there are two critical implications for us.
        First, if we are to rejoice always, it must mean that we should be
     rejoicing even when circumstances do not appear to give any grounds
     for rejoicing. Second, if we are to rejoice always, it must also mean
     that we are going to have to learn to rejoice at times when we do not
     feel like it.
        Paul is calling us to praise God even though many times it may
     seem quite unnatural to us. It may even seem unreasonable. But as we
     will see, it is precisely because there are times where it appears unrea-
     sonable that we are called to rejoice. In other words, praise is an act of
     faith. Just as faith is based not on our circumstances but rather on the
     truth about God, so praise is something we do, not because we feel
     good, but because of the truth of who God is and what He has prom-
     ised us. And amazingly, it is such faith that begins to shape our
     thoughts, feelings, and circumstances.

      What is the truth about God that Paul identifies in today’s
      text—truth that enables him to rejoice, even in prison? Write
      down a short list of what you know to be the truth about God.
      Go through the list and praise God for each item. How does this
      change the way that you feel about and view your circum-
      stances?


                                                                           73

     Praying Down Walls
        There’s an expression in English: “to be painted into a corner.”
     Imagine painting the floor of a room but then realizing that you have
     wound up in a corner and cannot get out—except by walking over the
     fresh paint. You have to stay there until it dries!
        Sometimes our faith seems to paint us into a corner. We arrive at a
     situation, and, like the wet paint on the floor, our faith “traps” us. We
     look at the situation and either have to reject God, faith, and every-
     thing we have believed in, or our faith compels us to believe what
     appears impossible.
        God brought the Israelites to a corner. After they had wandered for
     40 years in the wilderness, God did not lead His people to empty,
     peaceful grasslands. God led them to one of the most strongly forti-
     fied cities in the whole area. Then they had to walk around Jericho in
     silence for six days. On the seventh day God told them to shout—and
     that shouting, together with the trumpets, would bring victory.

Read Joshua 5:13–6:20. What is God trying to teach the Israelites?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Shouting loudly was not going to cause vibrations to trigger the
     walls to collapse. When God called the Israelites to “shout,” it was the
     same type of shouting that David writes about in Psalm 66: “Shout
     with joy to God, all the earth! Sing the glory of his name; make his
     praise glorious!” (vss. 1, 2, NIV). This shouting was praise! After six
     days of looking at the huge walls, they must have concluded that they
     hadn’t a chance of breaking them down themselves.

How does this idea help us understand the meaning of Hebrews 11:30?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

      When God is on the verge of doing something new in our lives,
      He may bring us to a Jericho, for He may need to teach us that
      the power to triumph does not come in our own strength and
      strategies. Everything we need comes from outside ourselves. So,
      no matter what is in front of us, no matter how insurmountable
      it may seem, our role is to praise God—the source of everything
      we need. This is faith in action.

     The Life of Praise
        Praising the Lord might not be natural to us, even in good circum-
     stances. Thus, how much more difficult to do it in bad ones? Yet, that
     is what we are called to do. Praise is something that must be practiced
     until it changes from being an activity done at a particular time to an
     atmosphere in which we live. Praise shouldn’t so much be a specific
     act but a specific way of life itself.

Read Psalm 145. What are the reasons David gives for praising God?
     In what ways should the words of this psalm be your own?

       The great British preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon wrote a book
     called The Practice of Praise. It is based on verse 7 of today’s psalm.
     In this short verse, Spurgeon calls our attention to three important
     things that can help in developing praise in our lives.
       1. Praise is practiced as we look around us. If we do not look
     around us to see the greatness of God, we will have no reason to praise
     Him. What can you see in the created world that is praiseworthy, such
     as the beauty of God’s creation? What can you see in the spiritual
     world that is praiseworthy, such as the growing faith in a young
     Christian?
       2. Praise is practiced as we remember what we have seen. If we
     want to live in an atmosphere of praise, we must be able to recall the
     reason for it. In what ways can we remember the great things about
     God, so that His goodness and the truth about Him do not slip from
     our minds (such as developing new rituals or symbols that remind us
     of His goodness)?
       3. Praise is practiced as we talk about it. Praise is not something
     that we do in our heads. It is meant to come out of our mouths, to be
     heard by those around us. What reasons can you think of to praise God
     verbally? What will the effect of such praise be, and on whom?

      Take a pen and some paper and spend some time working
      through these three points. What can you do to develop the habit
      of praise in your life?




                                                                        75

      A Witness Who Convicts
         In the book of Acts, praise had an astonishing effect on those who
      heard it. Read Acts 16:16–34. Having been stripped and beaten hard,
      Paul and Silas were thrown into prison. No one was there to put oint-
      ment on their badly cut and bruised backs. In great physical pain and
      with their feet in stocks, they were placed in the darkness of the inner
      prison. But as the other prisoners sat listening, Paul and Silas begin to
      pray and sing.
         After the earthquake, and after the jailer had discovered that neither
      Paul nor Silas nor any of the other prisoners had escaped, he “fell
      trembling before Paul and Silas. He then brought them out and asked,
      ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’ ” (vss. 29, 30, NIV).

Why did this event cause the jailer to focus on his own need of salva-
      tion? What role do you think Paul’s and Silas’s prayers and songs
      played in the prisoners’ not running away, and in the conversion of
      this man and his whole family?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         It is amazing to think that our praise can transform the eternal des-
      tinies of those around us. If Paul and Silas had sat in the dark mum-
      bling and complaining as prisoners often do, do you think anyone
      would have been saved that night?
         We don’t know what happened to the jailer and his family later on,
      but can you imagine them reading the words that Paul later wrote from
      another prison in Rome: “For it has been granted to you on behalf of
      Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him, since you
      are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that
      I still have” (Phil. 1:29, 30, NIV). If they did read this and reflected on
      how Paul’s suffering had brought them joy, it surely must have brought
      a song to their hearts and a fresh challenge to remain faithful, no mat-
      ter the cost.

       Who do you think could be influenced for God by a song of
       praise that could come from your heart? Make a concerted
       effort to be more open and effusive in your praise to God
       around others. You don’t know the positive effect it could have.

     A Weapon That Conquers
        Read 2 Chronicles 20:1–30. As Jehoshaphat discovered, praise is a
     powerful weapon. After receiving the report that a “vast army” was
     coming against him, Jehoshaphat did not immediately jump to mili-
     tary action but “resolved to inquire of the Lord” (vs. 3, NIV). As the
     people of Judah came to Jerusalem for a fast, Jehoshaphat admitted
     the reality of the situation, saying that “ ‘we have no power to face this
     vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes
     are upon you’ ” (vs. 12, NIV).

When you see a “vast army” approaching, what is your instinctive
     reaction? From Jehoshaphat’s response in verses 3–12, what can
     you learn about dealing with overwhelming opposition?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        As the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, he boldly announced:
     “ ‘ “You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand
     firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give you, O Judah and
     Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face
     them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you” ’ ” (vs. 17, NIV). After
     that, they worshiped God and sang praises to Him “with very loud
     voice” (vs. 19, NIV). Even though God was going to fight for them,
     they still had to go out to face the enemy.
        But this was no ordinary march to war. Jehoshaphat appointed a
     choir to sing praises to the Lord as they marched out. “As they began
     to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon
     and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were
     defeated” (vs. 22, NIV). According to the author, God intervened at
     the very moment they exercised their faith in His promise, as they
     began to “praise him for the splendor of his holiness” (vs. 21, NIV).

      Read through the texts for today again. What spiritual princi-
      ples can you find there that can be applied to your own walk
      with God, especially in times of trial and stress?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Jehoshaphat,” pp. 190–203,
         in Prophets and Kings; “The Fall of Jericho,” pp. 487–498, in Patriarchs
         and Prophets.

            “Then let us educate our hearts and lips to speak the praise of God
         for His matchless love. Let us educate our souls to be hopeful and to
         abide in the light shining from the cross of Calvary. Never should we
         forget that we are children of the heavenly King, sons and daughters
         of the Lord of hosts. It is our privilege to maintain a calm repose in
         God.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 253.
1           “And while I adore and magnify Him, I want you to magnify Him
         with me. Praise the Lord even when you fall into darkness. Praise Him
         even in temptation. ‘Rejoice in the Lord alway,’ says the apostle; ‘and
         again I say, Rejoice.’ Will that bring gloom and darkness into your
         families? No, indeed; it will bring a sunbeam. You will thus gather
         rays of eternal light from the throne of glory and scatter them around
2        you. Let me exhort you to engage in this work, scatter this light and
         life around you, not only in your own path, but in the paths of those
         with whom you associate. Let it be your object to make those around
         you better, to elevate them, to point them to heaven and glory, and lead
         them to seek, above all earthly things, the eternal substance, the
         immortal inheritance, the riches which are imperishable.”—Ellen G.
         White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, pp. 593, 594.
3   Discussion Questions:
          ●1 What role does community praise have in the life of the
          Christian? How would you describe the praise in your Sabbath
          services? Is it uplifting? Does it encourage members to maintain
          faithfulness amid trial and trauma? If not, what can be done?

          ●
          2 What does it mean to “praise the Lord even when you fall into
          darkness” or to “praise Him even in temptation”? How can
          praise help us through these situations?

          ●
          3 Let members give testimonies on how praise has affected their
          lives. What can you learn from each other’s experiences?

          ●
          4 As a class, pick a psalm of praise and spend time reading it.
          What does it teach you about praise? What impact does praise
          have on your faith?

When God Calls
by SAROJINI CHEDALAWADA
   Seetharathnam once sang chants to idols in a temple in India. She was a
medicine woman, treating people with sicknesses to devil possession by
tying strings on their arms and chanting healing mantras.
   One day she received a New Testament. She was curious about this
Christian God named Jesus. So one night she locked the doors and closed the
windows of her home and started to read the New Testament. She laid the
New Testament next to her pillow and went to sleep.
   Suddenly she was awakened by a bright light flooding her room. She did
not know where the light came from. Then she saw a man dressed in bright
white Indian garb standing in the light. He said, “Seetharathnam, will you
believe in Me completely?”
   She asked, “Who are You that I should believe in You?” As the Man stood
before her, she realized that this was Jesus. “Yes, Lord, I will believe in You,”
she said.
   The next day Seetharathnam visited her niece, who was a Christian. “I saw
Jesus in a dream last night. I would like to talk to your pastor.”
Seetharathnam began attending her niece’s church.
   One day Pastor Prasada Rao, an Adventist pastor, visited Seetharathnam.
She did not want to speak with another pastor, so Pastor Rao gave her some
Bible texts to read and invited her to contact him if she had any questions.
Soon Seetharathnam contacted the pastor to ask about the Sabbath. Pastor
Prasada Rao explained the Sabbath and other Bible truths.
   Seetharathnam wanted to know more, so the pastor arranged to hold meet-
ings in her village. Following the meetings Seetharathnam was baptized into
the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   Filled with the Spirit of God, Seetharathnam is a powerful witness for the
Lord, ministering to the poor and sick, praying for them and nursing the sick
back to health. She has raised up a church of more than thirty believers.
Fearlessly she tells others about her Jesus, who called her out of idol worship.
   Now when people come to Seetharathnam for healing, she tells them that
she is a Christian and does not chant the mantras anymore. “But I will pray
for you,” she says.
   Many people in Seetharathnam’s village have found the joy that Jesus
brings. Their transformation shows on their faces as they worship God each
Sabbath.
   Mission offerings make it possible for thousands in India and around the
world to hear the gospel and come to Christ.

        LESSON           10 *December 1–7
      Meekness in the
      Crucible


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 32:1–14, Ps. 62:1–8,
      Ezek. 24:15–27, Matt. 5:43–48, 1 Pet. 2:18–25.

Memory Text: “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the
      earth” (Matthew 5:5, NIV).

                 e don’t hear the word meek used much, except maybe when

      W          reading about Moses or studying the Beatitudes. It’s not
                 hard to figure out why, either. Meekness is defined as
      “enduring injury with patience and without resentment.” No wonder
      we don’t hear much about it; it’s hardly a trait well respected in cul-
      ture today. Sometimes the Bible translates this word as “humble.”
      Again, humility isn’t a character trait seen as desirable by most cul-
      tures, either.
        But meekness, enduring injury with patience and without resent-
      ment, is one of the most powerful characteristics of Jesus and His fol-
      lowers. And yet, it’s not an end in itself: Meekness of spirit can be a
      powerful weapon in the hands of those who are in the midst of pain
      and suffering. Indeed, the crucible is a great place to learn meekness
      of heart, for through our own meekness and broken places we can be
      powerful witnesses for God.

The Week at a Glance: What is the relationship between
      suffering and meekness? How can we, in our own meekness and
      broken places, be a witness to others? How can meekness really be
      a strength, not a weakness, for the Christian?

     Broken Bread and Poured-Out Wine
     Oswald Chambers has said that we are to become “broken bread
     and poured-out wine” for others. What do you think he means by
     this?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       All through the Bible there are examples of people being “broken”
     to serve others. Moses was called to endure unending waves of gossip
     and criticism as he led people to the Promised Land. Joseph was
     called to a journey that involved betrayal and imprisonment as he was
     brought to a position of service in Egypt. In each case, God permitted
     the situations in order that His people’s lives could become theaters of
     His grace and care, not only for themselves but for the good of others,
     as well. God may use us in the same way. It is easy to feel angry or
     hurt in such situations. But as we noted yesterday, meekness is the
     God-given ability to endure such things “with patience and without
     resentment.”

Read Ezekiel 24:15–27. What’s happening here? Why was Ezekiel
     put through this crucible?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        In verse 24 God says, “ ‘ “Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do
     just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the
     Sovereign Lord” ’ ” (NIV). Through Ezekiel’s example the people of
     Israel were going to be convicted of the truth about who God was, the
     Sovereign Lord—as they experienced the fulfillment of the prophecy
     that Ezekiel’s life was symbolizing. But they would see this only
     because Ezekiel became broken in the fingers of God—for them. Who
     knows how many people will see “the Sovereign Lord” through us in
     our own broken places, as well?

      Sooner or later life itself breaks us all. What has been your
      experience with being broken? What lessons have you learned?
      How can your own broken soul be used by the Lord to help
      other people?

      Interceding for Grace
Read Exodus 32:1–14. What role do we find Moses playing here?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        After the people began worshiping the golden calf, God decided
      they had gone too far and announced that He would destroy the peo-
      ple and make Moses a great nation. But rather than taking up God’s
      offer, Moses pleaded for God to show grace to His people, and God
      relented.
        Exodus 32:1–14 raises two important issues. First, God’s offer to
      destroy the rebellious people and bless Moses was a test for him. God
      wanted Moses to demonstrate just how much compassion he felt for
      these desperately disobedient people. And Moses passed. Like Jesus,
      he pleaded for mercy for sinners. This reveals something very inter-
      esting: Sometimes God may also allow us to face opposition, He
      might allow us to be in a crucible so that He, we, and the watching
      universe can see how much compassion we have for those who are
      wayward.

What reasons did Moses give for asking the Lord not to destroy Israel?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Second, this passage shows that opposition and disobedience are
      calls to reveal grace. Grace is needed when people least deserve it. But
      when they least deserve it is also the time that we feel the least like
      offering it. But when Moses’ sister, Miriam, was criticizing him, he
      cried out to the Lord to heal her from leprosy (Numbers 12). When
      God was angry with Korah and his followers and threatened to destroy
      them all, Moses fell on his face to plead for their lives. The next day,
      when Israel grumbled against Moses for the death of the rebels and
      God threatened to destroy them all again, Moses fell facedown and
      urged Aaron quickly to make atonement for them all (Numbers 16). In
      his own meekness, in his own selflessness in the midst of this crucible,
      Moses sought grace on behalf of those who certainly didn’t deserve it.

       Think about the people around you who you think are the least
       deserving of grace. How can you, with meekness and selfless
       humility, be a revelation of God’s grace to them?

     Loving Those Who Hurt Us
       Someone once said: “Loving our enemies, then, does not mean that
     we are supposed to love the dirt in which the pearl is buried; rather it
     means that we love the pearl which lies in the dust. . . . God does not
     love us because we are by nature lovable. But we become lovable
     because He loves us.”

When you look at your “enemies,” what do you normally see—the
     pearl or the dirt around it?

Read Matthew 5:43–48. Jesus calls us to love and pray for our ene-
     mies. What example from nature does Jesus give us there that
     helps us understand why we should love our enemies? What’s the
     point He is teaching us?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        In verse 45, Jesus uses the example of His Father in heaven to illus-
     trate how we should treat those who hurt us, who perhaps put us in the
     worst kind of crucibles. Jesus says that His Father sends the blessing
     of rain to both the righteous and the unrighteous; if God gives even the
     unjust rain, how then should we treat them, as well?
        Jesus isn’t trying to say that we should always have a warm, fuzzy
     feeling to everyone who causes us trouble, though this may also be
     possible. Fundamentally, love for our enemies is not meant to be a
     feeling we have for them but specific actions toward them that reveal
     care and consideration.
        Jesus concludes this passage with a verse that often causes a lot of
     debate: “ ‘Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect’ ”
     (vs. 48, NIV). But the meaning is very clear in the context: Those peo-
     ple who want to be perfect as God is perfect must show love to their
     enemies as God shows love to His. To be perfect in God’s sight is to
     love the opposition; and to do this takes a meekness of heart that only
     God can give.

      Keeping in mind our definition of meekness (“enduring injury
      with patience and without resentment”), list the changes you
      must make in order to allow the Lord to give you the kind of
      meekness of heart that will help you have the right attitude
      toward “enemies.”

                                                                         83

      A Closed Mouth
        The most powerful examples of meekness in the crucible come
      from Jesus. When He said to come and “learn of me; for I am meek
      and lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:29, NKJV), He meant it in ways we
      probably can’t imagine.

Read 1 Peter 2:18–25. Peter is offering some surprising advice to slaves.
      He describes how Jesus responded to unjust and painful treat-
      ment and suggests to them that He has left them “an example, that
      you should follow His steps” (1 Pet. 2:21, NKJV). What principles
      of meekness and humility in the crucible can we learn from Jesus’
      example, as expressed here by Peter?
      ____________________________________________________________________

        It is terrible to watch someone else unjustly treat another. And it is
      extremely painful when we are at the receiving end of such treatment.
      Because we normally have a strong sense of justice, when injustice
      occurs our instincts are to “put things right” while carrying what we
      believe to be a righteous and just anger.
        It is not easy to live like this. It is perhaps impossible unless we
      embrace one critical truth—that in all unjust situations, we must
      believe that our Father in heaven is in control and that He will act on
      our behalf when it is according to His will. This also means that we
      must be open to the possibility that like Jesus, we may not always be
      saved from injustice. But we must always remember that our Father in
      heaven is still with us and in charge.
        Peter’s advice, modeled from Jesus’ life, is surprising because it
      seems to be that silence in the face of unjust suffering is a greater wit-
      ness to the glory of God than “putting people right.” When questioned
      by Caiaphas and Pilate, Jesus could have said a lot of things to correct
      the situation and to justify Himself, but He didn’t. His silence was a
      testimony to His meekness.

       How do you deal with situations in which you have been treated
       unfairly? How can you better apply some of the principles
       looked at here today to your own life?

     Our Rock and Refuge
        So often the most proud people, the most arrogant and pushy, are
     those who suffer from low self-esteem. Their arrogance and pride—
     and total lack of meekness or humility—exist as cover, perhaps even
     unconsciously, for something lacking inside. What they need is some-
     thing we all need: a sense of security, of worthiness, of acceptance,
     especially in times of distress and suffering. We can find that only
     through the Lord. In short, meekness and humility, far from being
     attributes of weakness, are often the most powerful manifestation of a
     soul firmly grounded on the Rock.

Read Psalm 62:1–8. What seems to be the background for this psalm?
     What points is David making? What spiritual principles can you
     learn from what he is saying? Most important, how can you learn
     to apply these principles to your own life?

       “Without cause men will become our enemies. The motives of the
     people of God will be misinterpreted, not only by the world, but by
     their own brethren. The Lord’s servants will be put in hard places. A
     mountain will be made of a molehill to justify men in pursuing a self-
     ish, unrighteous course. . . . By misrepresentation these men will be
     clothed in the dark vestments of dishonesty because circumstances
     beyond their control made their work perplexing. They will be pointed
     to as men that cannot be trusted. And this will be done by the mem-
     bers of the church. God’s servants must arm themselves with the mind
     of Christ. They must not expect to escape insult and misjudgment.
     They will be called enthusiasts and fanatics. But let them not become
     discouraged. God’s hands are on the wheel of His providence, guiding
     His work to the glory of His name.”—Ellen G. White, in Spalding and
     Magan Collection, p. 370.

      How immune are you to the reproaches and barbs of others?
      Mostly likely not that immune, right? What can you do to bet-
      ter cleave to the Lord, to better anchor your sense of self-worth
      on the One who loves you so much that He died for your sins and
      thus help protect yourself against the slights of others?



                                                                       85
                      F RIDAY December 7

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Seeking True Knowledge,”
         pp. 453, 454, in The Ministry of Healing; “The Sermon on the
         Mount,” pp. 298–314, in The Desire of Ages; “The Worker and His
         Qualifications,” p. 630, in Evangelism.

            “The difficulties we have to encounter may be very much lessened
         by that meekness which hides itself in Christ. If we possess the humil-
1
         ity of our Master, we shall rise above the slights, the rebuffs, the
         annoyances, to which we are daily exposed, and they will cease to cast
         a gloom over the spirit. The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian
         is self-control. He who under abuse or cruelty fails to maintain a calm
         and trustful spirit robs God of His right to reveal in him His own per-
         fection of character. Lowliness of heart is the strength that gives vic-
2
         tory to the followers of Christ; it is the token of their connection with
         the courts above.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 301.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 How does humility allow us to “rise above” hurts and annoy-
          ances? What do you think is the most important characteristic of
          humility that allows us to do this?
3
          ●
          2 In your own particular culture, how are the characteristics of
          humility and meekness viewed? Are they respected, despised, or
          what? What kind of pressures do you face in your culture that
          work against your cultivating these characteristics?

          ●
          3 Are there any great examples of meekness and humility from
          people alive today? If so, who are they, how have they expressed
          these traits, and what can you learn from them?

          ●
          4 Why is it that we so often equate meekness and humility with
          weakness?

          ●
          5 We saw how David sought the Lord as a refuge. But how does
          that work, how is that refuge always manifested? In other words,
          how can we, as a church, be a refuge for those who need a refuge?
          What kind of refuge does your own local church provide? What
          can you do to help make it a place of refuge for those who need
          it?

A Teen With a Mission
  Ariane de Melo Felipe is a 14-year-old Brazilian girl with dreams—two
very big dreams. They are not the dreams of most teenage girls. Ariane
dreams of building a church in the Novo Barrio (neighborhood) of the city
of São José do Mipibu, near her home. Her second dream is to study the-
ology. To Ariane her dreams are concrete, for already she has led hundreds
of people to Christ.
  When Ariane was still quite young, her parents, Romário and Lourdes,
noticed that Ariane had a heart for God that few others of any age possess.
She joined her church’s Pathfinder Club, began to study the Bible in depth,
and took part in lay training sessions sponsored by her local mission. Then
she organized her own Bible class. As a result of her efforts, six people
gave their lives to Jesus.
  Her pastor recommended that Ariane take part in an intensive union-
wide lay training session with adults three or four times her age. After
returning home, she organized a series of meetings and preached 13 times.
As a result, eight people decided to follow Jesus.
  Ariane focused on an area four miles (seven kilometers) from her home.
She had to walk along a busy highway to reach the neighborhood, but she
was not afraid. She visited people, gave Bible studies, and organized a
Bible class with 15 participants. And eight more precious souls came to
the Master. When her local mission learned of her continuing dedication
to evangelism, they bought her a bicycle, so she could make the trip more
quickly and safely. Ariane uses her new bicycle to hold more meetings,
organize more Bible study groups, and lead more people to Jesus.
  Because of Ariane’s dedication to evangelism, more than one hundred
people in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, have been baptized.
                                   Evangelism takes many forms. Some,
                                 such as Ariane, have the gift of evangelism.
                                 But we all can have a part when we give
                                 our mission offerings every week.

        LESSON           11 *December 8–14
      Waiting in the Crucible




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Samuel 26; Ps. 37:1–11;
      Rom. 5:3–5; 15:4, 5.

Memory Text: “But the fruit of the Spirit is . . . patience” (Galatians
      5:22, NIV).

             cientists did an experiment with four-year-old children and

      S      marshmallows. Each child was told by a scientist that they could
             have a marshmallow; however, if the child waited until the sci-
      entist returned from an errand, they would be given two. Some of the
      children stuffed the marshmallow into their mouths the moment the
      scientist left; others waited. The differences were noted.
         The scientists then kept track of these children into their teenage
      years. The ones who had waited turned out to be better adjusted, bet-
      ter students, and more confident than those who didn’t. It seemed that
      patience was indicative of something greater, something important in
      the human character. No wonder, then, we’re told to cultivate it by the
      Lord.
         This week we’ll look at what could be behind some of the most try-
      ing of all crucibles: the crucible of waiting.

The Week at a Glance: Why do we sometimes have to
      wait so long for things? What lessons can we learn about patience
      while in the crucible?

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, December 15.

     The God of Patience
Read Romans 15:4, 5. What is found in these verses for us?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       We are normally impatient about things that we really want or have
     been promised but don’t have yet. We are often satisfied only when we
     get what we are longing for. And because we rarely get what we want
     when we want it, it means that we are often doomed to irritation and
     impatience. And when we are in this state, it is almost impossible to
     maintain a peace and trust in God.
       Waiting is painful by definition. In Hebrews, one of the words for
     “wait patiently” (Ps. 37:7, NKJV) comes from a Hebrew word that can
     be translated “to be much pained,” “to shake,” “to tremble,” “to be
     wounded,” “to be sorrowful.” Learning patience is not easy; some-
     times it’s the very essence of what it means to be in the crucible.

Read Psalms 27:14, 37:7, and Romans 5:3–5. What are these verses
     saying to us? What does patience lead to?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       While we wait, we can concentrate on one of two things. We can
     focus on the things that we are waiting for, or we can focus on the One
     who holds those things in His hands. What makes such a difference
     when we wait for something isn’t so much how long we have to wait
     as it is our attitude while we wait. If we trust the Lord, if we have
     placed our lives in His hands, if we have surrendered our wills to Him,
     then we can trust that He will do what’s best for us when it’s best for
     us, no matter how hard it is sometimes to believe it.

      What things are you desperately waiting for? How can you learn
      to surrender everything to God and to His timing? Pray your
      way into an attitude of complete surrender and submission to
      the Lord.

                                                                        89

     In God’s Time
Read Romans 5:6 and Galatians 4:4. What do they tell us about
     God’s timing?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       In these texts, Paul tells us that Jesus came to die for us at exactly
     the right time. But Paul does not tell us why it was the right time. It is
     very easy to read these verses and wonder, Why did Jesus wait for
     thousands of years until He came to the earth to deal with sin—didn’t
     the universe understand that sin was a very bad thing long before
     then? We may ask why Jesus is waiting to come the second time also.
     We may also ask, Why is the Lord waiting so long to answer my
     prayer?

Think about, for instance, the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9:24–27,
     the prophecy that points to Jesus as the Messiah (review it if you
     need to). How long was this time period? What does this tell you
     about learning to wait for things in God’s time, even if it takes
     what seems to us a long time?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       There are many important spiritual reasons that we will experience
     waiting times. First, waiting can refocus our attention away from
     “things” and back to God Himself. Second, waiting allows us to
     develop a clearer picture of our own motives and desires. Third, wait-
     ing builds perseverance—spiritual stamina. Fourth, waiting opens the
     door to develop many spiritual strengths, such as faith and trust. Fifth,
     waiting allows God to put down other pieces in the puzzle of the big-
     ger picture. Sixth, we may never know the reason we have to wait;
     hence, we learn to live by faith. Can you think of any other reasons for
     waiting?

      What examples can you find in the Bible of God doing things in
      His own time that can help you learn to trust that He will do for
      you what’s right in His own time, as well? (Think, for instance,
      about Abraham and Sarah and the promise of a son.) At the
      same time, ask yourself, “What might I be doing that could be
      delaying a prayer that could have been answered long ago?”

     David: An Object Lesson in Waiting
       In 1 Samuel 16:1–13, we see the young lad David anointed by
     Samuel as king. However, it was a long journey from the fields of his
     father, Jesse, to the throne in Jerusalem. No doubt, at times he felt in
     the midst of a crucible.
       First, the lad is called to play music to soothe Saul’s troubled spirit
     (1 Samuel 16). Later, he becomes Israel’s hero as he kills Goliath
     (1 Samuel 17). Then there are many years during which David is run-
     ning for his life. Both Saul and his son Jonathan know that David is
     destined to be the next king (1 Sam. 23:17, 24:20). But David does
     nothing to advance his God-given destiny. In fact, he appears to do the
     opposite. Even when Saul tries to kill him and David snips a piece of
     cloth off the king’s robe, he wished he had never done such a thing
     (1 Sam. 24:5–7). Again when Saul is trying to kill David, David
     refuses to kill Saul when the opportunity arises (1 Sam. 26:7–11).

Read 1 Samuel 26:1–11. Why does David refuse to kill Saul? What
     principles does this teach us about the way God brings about His
     plans for our lives?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

Now read 1 Samuel 26:12–25. How does David’s refusal to kill Saul
     affect Saul? What does this teach us about the advantages of wait-
     ing for God?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Looking at the whole of David’s road to the throne, we could per-
     haps summarize it in a short sentence—don’t grab what God has not
     yet given. God’s gifts are always best received from His hand and in
     His time. This may require a very long time of waiting. Bean sprouts
     may literally grow up within hours, while an oak tree will take many
     years. But then when the strong winds come, the tree will not be
     uprooted.

      Think how easily David could have justified killing Saul. (“After
      all, wasn’t I told I’d have the throne? And Saul is so evil any-
      way.”) Yet, his actions speak of true faith in God. What might
      you be able to draw from this example for yourself in whatever
      you might be waiting for?


                                                                          91

      Elijah: The Problem of Rushing
        The showdown on top of Mount Carmel had ended (1 Kings 18).
      Fire had come out of heaven, all the people had acknowledged the true
      God, and the false prophets had been put to death. God had been vin-
      dicated. You would have thought that Elijah would have been growing
      in spiritual strength as the day went on, but suddenly he heard some-
      thing that terrified him so much that he wanted to die. Read the rest
      of the story in 1 Kings 19:1–9. The last words in the text are worri-
      some: “And the word of the Lord came to him: ‘What are you doing
      here, Elijah?’ ” (vs. 9, NIV). Evidently, Elijah’s fear caused him to run
      and find himself in the wrong place.

After such a powerful intervention by the Lord, Elijah should have
      been full of faith and trust; instead, he runs in fear for his life.
      What lesson can we learn from this bad example?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        This story illustrates something important: When we rush, we can
      very easily find ourselves in the wrong place. In Elijah’s case, it was
      his fear that caused him to be overwhelmed and rush into the desert,
      wishing that he had never been born. But there are other things that
      cause us to rush outside of God’s plan for us.

Read the following texts. What things caused the characters depicted
      here to rush outside of God’s will? Gen. 16:1–3; Num. 20:10–12;
      Judg. 14:1–3; Matt. 20:20, 21; Luke 9:52–56; Acts 9:1.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

       How easy to let such things as ambition, anger, passion, lack of
       faith, and a supposed “zeal” for the Lord cause us to rush ahead
       to where we shouldn’t be. No one is immune to this danger. The
       key is to cultivate a trusting faith in the goodness and mercy of
       God, who we know loves us and wants what’s best for us. This
       doesn’t happen automatically. Faith might be a gift, but it’s a
       gift that needs to be cultivated, nurtured, and jealously guarded.

      Learning to Delight in the Lord
        “Delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your
      heart” (Ps. 37:4, NRSV).

        Psalm 37:4 is a wonderful promise. Imagine getting what you have
      always wanted. But getting the desires of our hearts hinges on having
      a heart that is delighting in the Lord. So what does it mean to “delight
      in the Lord”?
        Read Psalm 37:1–11. The context for verse 4 is perhaps a little sur-
      prising. David is writing about being surrounded by people who are
      working against God and against him. When people are working
      against us, the natural response is often to get angry or to set out to
      justify ourselves. But David advises something different.
In the following verses, what is David’s counsel to God’s people in this
      situation?

      vs. 8
      ____________________________________________________________________

Read verse 4 again. In the context of the verses you have just made com-
      ments on, what does it mean “to delight in the Lord”?


         David is repeating again and again, in different ways, “Trust God.”
      Trust Him to act. Don’t get upset, because God is your God, and He
      is working for you—even right now. You don’t have to charge in and
      try to sort things out by yourself. Your Father in heaven is in charge.
      Trust Him. Trust Him completely.
         It is in this context that David writes about delighting in the Lord.
      To delight in God means that we live in a state of perfect trust.
      Nothing can ruffle our peace, because God is here and at work. We
      can praise Him, we can even smile, because no one can outwit our
      God! When we can learn to do this, we really will receive what our
      hearts long for, because we will receive what our loving Father wants
      to give us, at the time that most benefits us and His kingdom.

       How can you learn to “delight in the Lord”? Spend some time
       in prayer, seeking God’s guidance in how this may become a
       reality in your life.

                                                                          93

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Anointing of David,”
         pp. 637–642; “David and Goliath,” pp. 643–648; “David a Fugitive,”
         pp. 649–659; “The Magnanimity of David,” pp. 660–674; “The Death
         of Saul,” pp. 675–682, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

            God’s plan for us may require that we do a lot of waiting, and this
         really can feel like a crucible. Learning patience during this time can
         be developed as we focus on the person of God and trust that He is
1
         acting for us. There are many reasons for waiting, but all are con-
         cerned with the fulfillment of God’s plans for us and His kingdom.
         Much can be lost if we rush ahead of God, but much can be gained by
         maintaining an attitude of trust and delight in Him.
            “Every trial is weighed and measured by the Lord Jesus Christ, and
         it is not beyond man’s ability to endure through the grace given unto
2
         him.”—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 12, p. 81.
            “I cannot read the purpose of God in my affliction, but He knows
         what is best, and I will commit my soul, body, and spirit to Him as
         unto my faithful Creator. ‘For I know whom I have believed, and am
         persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto
         him against that day’ (2 Tim. 1:12). If we educated and trained our
         souls to have more faith, more love, greater patience, and a more per-
         fect trust in our heavenly Father, I know we would have more peace
3
         and happiness day by day as we pass through the conflicts of this life.
            “The Lord is not pleased to have us fret and worry ourselves out of
         the arms of Jesus. More is needed of the quiet waiting and watching
         combined. We think unless we have feeling that we are not in the right
         track, and we keep looking within for some sign befitting the occa-
         sion; but the reckoning is not of feeling but of faith.”—Ellen G.
         White, Selected Messages, book 2, p. 242.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What does it mean that every trial is “weighed and measured”
          by Jesus? How can knowing this help us while we wait?

          ●
          2 Have people in class give personal testimonies to what patient
          waiting is all about. What were their fears, their joys? How did
          they cope? What did they learn? What promises did they cling
          to?

          ●
          3 What can you do as a church, or a class, to help others who
          are in the crucible as they await God’s timing for something?

          ●4 What is the role of prayer in the development of patience? Are
          there others you can pray for so the Spirit will develop patience
          in their lives?

Mickey’s Mission
by HOMER TRECARTIN
   My wife and I were visiting a small country church in rural Virginia,
U.S.A. The little church looked sleepy, but we soon learned that it was
alive and active in mission.
   Mickey greeted us at the door with a memorable phrase, “If ya really
want ta find somethin’, ya will!” Seeing our interest in his statement, he
continued. “Some folk think Ah was vaccinated with a phonograph nee-
dle, but really, Ah just want ta find people Ah can tell ’bout Jesus,” Mickey
said in his country drawl. “Even out here in the country, if ya want ta find
people ta tell ’bout Jesus, just look for ’em. They’re all around ya. Why, a
few days ago Ah met a man who had read the book ’bout Desmond T.
Doss, and now he wants ta find the book so his girl can read it. Ah went
home and ordered one fer him and sent it direct ta his house. Later Ah’ll
go see him with other literature.”
   Mickey related that two days earlier he had met an Amish man. When
Mickey started talking to the man about Jesus, the man said he didn’t have
time to talk. Mickey’s smile dimmed as he said softly, “I reckon I won’t
ever have no time ta talk ’bout Jesus.”
   The man stopped working, looked at Mickey, and said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t
really mean that. It’s just, well, somethin’s been botherin me lately.”
   “What’s that?” Mickey asked, the sparkle returning to his eyes as he
relived the story.
   “Well, someone gave me a book on the Ten Commandments,” the man
said, “and I’ve been reading it. But I just don’t know what to think. Do you
think I will be lost if I don’t keep Saturday as the Sabbath?”
   Mickey rubbed his chin and answered slowly, “I reckon I’m not the
judge of those things. But I do remember Jesus said once, ‘If ya love Me,
keep My commandments.’ ”
   The service was about to start, but just as I stood to join the elders on
the platform, Mickey whispered, “I’m a goin’ back ta see him this week.”
   Later I learned that Mickey has a barrel half full of arrowheads at his
house. When people ask where he found them all, he smiles and tells
them, “Same way Ah find people to tell ’bout Jesus. Ah look for ’em
wherever Ah is! If ya really want ta find somethin’, ya will!”

        LESSON             12 *December 15–21
      Dying Like a Seed




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Sam. 2:12–3:18; 13:1–14;
      Zech. 4:1–14; Rom. 12:1, 2; Phil. 2:5–9.

Memory Text: “I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls
      to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies,
      it produces many seeds” (John 12:24, NIV).

           esus’ picture of a kernel of wheat dying is a fascinating analogy of

      J    our submission to God’s will.
            First, there is the falling. The kernel that falls from the wheat stalk
      has no control over where or how it falls to the ground. It has no con-
      trol over the ground that surrounds and then presses over it.
         Second, there is the waiting. As the kernel lies in the earth, it does
      not know what the future holds. It cannot “imagine” what life will be
      like in the future, for it is only a kernel of wheat.
         Third, there is the dying. The kernel cannot possibly become a
      wheat stalk unless it gives up the safe, comfortable situation as a ker-
      nel. It must “die”; that is, it must give up what it has always been
      before it may be transformed from a seed into a fruit-bearing plant.

The Week at a Glance: If we know that God’s will is best
      for us, why do we have such a hard time accepting it? What exam-
      ple of submission has Christ left for us? How do you see the anal-
      ogy of the kernel of wheat applying to your own life?

      Submission for Service
Read Philippians 2:5–9. What important message is there for us in
      these verses?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Contemporary culture urges us all to demand and assert our rights.
      And all this is good and is often the way it should be. But, as with
      Jesus, the will of God may ask us to freely give up our rights in order
      to serve the Father in ways that will make an eternal impact for God’s
      kingdom. This process of giving them up may be difficult and uncom-
      fortable, creating the conditions of a crucible. Look at how Jesus did
      this (Phil. 2:5–8). These verses describe three steps that Jesus took in
      submitting Himself to the Father’s will. And at the beginning, Paul
      alarmingly reminds us: “Your attitude should be the same as that of
      Christ Jesus” (vs. 5, NIV).
        In order to be in a position to save us, Jesus gave up His equality
      with the Father and moved to earth in the form and limitations of a
      human being (vss. 6, 7, NIV). Jesus did not come as a great and glori-
      ous human being but as a servant of other human beings (vs. 7, NIV).
        As a human servant, Jesus did not live a peaceful and long life but
      “became obedient to death.” But He did not even die in a noble and
      glorious manner. No, He was “obedient to death—even death on a
      cross!” (vs. 8, NIV).

In what areas of life is this example of Jesus a model for us? If rights
      and equality are good and should be protected, how would you
      explain the logic of sometimes needing to give them up? Now read
      verse 9. In what way does this verse help us to understand the logic
      of submission to the Father’s will?

       Pray for wisdom from the Holy Spirit, asking, What rights am I

       around me? To what extent am I willing to endure discomfort to
       serve others more effectively?

     Dying Comes Before Knowing God’s
     Will
        Many Christians sincerely seek to know God’s will for their lives.
     “If only I could know God’s will for my life, I would sacrifice every-
     thing for Him.” But even after promising God this, we still may be
     confused about that will. The reason for this confusion may be found
     in Romans 12:1, 2. Paul is describing how we can know God’s will,
     and he makes an important point: If you want to know what God’s will
     is, you have to sacrifice first!
        Read Romans 12:1, 2. Paul writes that we will be able to “test and
     approve what God’s will is” (vs. 2, NIV) when:
        1. We have a true understanding of “God’s mercy” for us (vs. 1,
     NIV).
        2. We offer ourselves as living sacrifices to God (vs. 1).
        3. Our minds are renewed (vs. 2).
        It is only the renewed mind that truly can understand God’s will. But
     this renewal hinges on our death to self first. It was not enough that
     Christ simply suffered for us—He had to die. It is the same with us.

Ask the Holy Spirit to show you any areas in which you are not com-
     pletely “dead.” What things does the Holy Spirit need you to give
     up in order to become a “living sacrifice” for God?


       When areas of our lives are not completely dead to self, God per-
     mits crucibles to bring them to our attention. However, our suffering
     not only helps us confront our sin, it also gives us an insight into
     Jesus’ giving Himself up for us. Elisabeth Elliot writes, “The surren-
     der of our heart’s deepest longing is perhaps as close as we come to an
     understanding of the cross. . . . Our own experience of crucifixion,
     though immeasurably less than our Savior’s, nonetheless furnishes us
     with a chance to begin to know Him in the fellowship of His suffer-
     ings. In every form of our own suffering, He calls us to that fellow-
     ship.”—Quest for Love (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Fleming H. Revell,
     1966), p. 182.

      Read and pray over Romans 12:1, 2. Think about the things you
      need to give up in order for you to become a sacrifice. How does
      this help you to understand the sufferings Jesus faced for you on
      the cross? How can this knowledge help you enter into fellow-
      ship with Jesus and His sufferings?

      Willingness to Listen
         “The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times,
      ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ Then Samuel said, ‘Speak, for your servant is
      listening’ ” (1 Sam. 3:10, NIV).

        Have you ever heard that still, small voice of the Holy Spirit but
      ignored it? Consequently, everything went wrong, and you thought to
      yourself later, Oh no, why didn’t I listen?
        First Samuel describes a story of an old man and two wicked sons
      who didn’t listen to the Lord and a little boy who did. Though there
      were strong warnings from God, those who needed to change their
      course didn’t.

Read their story in 1 Samuel 2:12–3:18. What contrast is made appar-
      ent here between those who listen to God and those who don’t?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Eli’s sons had other things on their minds than the things of God.
      And even when Eli, after hearing what God wanted, spoke to his sons,
      he didn’t seem to do anything else. And his sons were obviously not
      ready to submit the details of their lives to God’s will. What a contrast
      to the young Samuel!
         Preacher Charles Stanley describes how essential it is to cultivate
      openness to God’s voice in what he calls “shifting into neutral.” He
      says: “The Holy Spirit . . . does not speak for the sake of passing along
      information. He speaks to get a response. And He knows when our
      agenda has such a large slice of our attention that it is a waste of time
      to suggest anything to the contrary. When that is the case, He is often
      silent. He waits for us to become neutral enough to hear and eventu-
      ally obey.”—The Wonderful Spirit-Filled Life (Nashville, Tenn.: Thomas
      Nelson, Inc., Publishers, 1992), pp. 179, 180.

       What do you think Stanley means by becoming “neutral
       enough”? When you think about your openness to God, what
       things often prevent you from being “neutral enough to hear
       and eventually obey”? What do you need to do in your life to
       cultivate openness to God’s voice and a decisiveness to be obe-
       dient to His direction?




                                                                           99

      Self-Reliance
         When Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden, it wasn’t simply because
      she doubted God’s word. At the heart of the problem was her belief
      that she had enough wisdom to decide what was good and right for
      herself. She trusted her own judgment. When we rely on our own
      judgment as opposed to trusting God’s Word, we open ourselves up to
      all sorts of problems.
         The story of Saul describes the steps to self-reliance and the tragedy
      that so quickly follows. Samuel anointed Saul as God’s king (1 Sam.
      10:1). Then he gave Saul specific instructions (vs. 8), but Saul dis-
      obeyed.

Read the next part of the story in 1 Samuel 13:1–14. What did Saul do
      that led to his own downfall?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         There are three steps that led Saul down the road to self-reliance so
      soon after having been made king. The problem is that none of the
      steps were that bad in themselves. Yet, they contained the seeds of
      tragedy because they were each taken independently of God. Notice
      the order in which Saul’s fall occurred.
         1. Saul said, “I saw” (NIV)—the scattering of his troops and
      Samuel’s absence (vs. 11). Saul was under pressure, and he evaluated
      with his own eyes what was happening.
         2. Saul moved from “I saw” to “I said”—that the Philistines would
      conquer them (vs. 12, NKJV). What he saw with his own eyes shaped
      what he said, or surmised, about the situation.
         3. Saul moved from “I said” to “I felt”—compelled to offer sacri-
      fice (vs. 12, NKJV). What Saul thought now shaped his feelings.
         All of us have done this: We rely on our own human eyesight, which
      leads us to rely on our own human thinking, which leads us to rely on
      our own human feelings. And then we act on these feelings.

       Why do you think it was so easy for Saul to follow his own judg-
       ment, even though he had God’s clear instructions still ringing
       in his ears? If we know that we are so fragile and have such
       imperfect knowledge, why do we still try to rely on ourselves?
       What can we do to learn more to trust in the Lord’s commands
       than upon ourselves?

     Substitutes
        As we saw yesterday, submission to God’s will can be undermined
     as we rely on our own strength. It also is possible to rely on other sub-
     stitutes for God. When some people feel depressed, they go shopping
     for something to make them happy. When some feel inadequate, they
     pursue fame. When others have difficulties with their spouse, they
     look for someone else to give them intimacy and excitement.
        Many of the things we use can relieve the pressure, but they do not
     necessarily solve the problem nor teach us how to handle the situation
     better the next time. Only supernatural help from God can do that. The
     problem is that many times we try to depend on substitutes for God
     rather than on God Himself.
        Here are three substitutes that we may use instead of God:
        1. Using human logic or past experience when we need fresh divine
     revelation.
        2. Blocking problems from our minds when we need divine solu-
     tions.
        3. Escaping reality and avoiding God when we need communion
     with God for divine power.
        Zechariah helps us to focus on what really matters when we are
     tempted to use substitutes. After many years away, the exiles had
     finally returned from Babylon and immediately began to rebuild the
     temple. But there was an incredible amount of opposition to this (some
     background can be found in Ezra 4–6). So Zechariah came with this
     message of encouragement to Zerubbabel, who was leading the work.

Read this message in Zechariah 4:1–14. What does God mean in verse
     6? How could the completion of a building project be affected by
     the Holy Spirit? What does this teach us about the relationship
     between the Holy Spirit and the practical things that we do?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        God did not prevent the opposition to the temple nor spare
     Zerubbabel from the stress of dealing with it. And God will not always
     protect us from opposition. But when opposition comes, God may use
     it as a crucible to teach us to depend on Him.

      When stress comes, what’s your first reaction? Food? Television?
      Prayer? Submission to God? What does your answer tell you
      about yourself and the things you need to learn or to change?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Eli and His Sons,” pp. 575–
          580; “The Presumption of Saul,” pp. 616–626, in Patriarchs and
          Prophets.

             Submission to God’s will comes as we die to our own desires and
          ambitions. This opens the way for true service to others. We cannot
          live for God without becoming a sacrifice and living in continual
          openness to God’s voice. For us to truly submit our wills to our
          Father’s will, we must recognize the dangers of relying on ourselves
          and on substitutes for God’s Word and power. As submission to God’s
1         will is at the heart of a Christlike life, God may allow crucibles to
          teach us dependence on Him.
             “The neglect of Eli is brought plainly before every father and
          mother in the land. As the result of his unsanctified affection or his
          unwillingness to do a disagreeable duty, he reaped a harvest of iniq-
          uity in his perverse sons. Both the parent who permitted the wicked-
2         ness and the children who practiced it were guilty before God, and He
          would accept no sacrifice or offering for their transgression.”—Ellen
          G. White, Child Guidance, p. 276.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●1 As a class, talk about the incredible condescension of the Son
           of God in coming to earth as a human being in order to die for
           our sins. What does it tell each of us about what self-sacrifice and
3          self-denial for the good of others means? Though we certainly
           can’t do anything like that, the principle is there and should
           always be before us. What ways can we, in our own spheres, emu-
           late the kind of submission and self-sacrifice shown to us by
           Jesus at the Cross?

           ●
           2 For many people, submitting to God without knowing what
           will happen next can be a terrifying thing. How would you coun-
           sel someone who is relying on themselves rather than God? What
           would you say to help remove their fears of not knowing—or
           being able to control—the future?

           ●
           3 As a class, spend some time praying for people you know who
           have difficulty in submitting to God’s will, that they may see that
           trusting God’s will is the only route to a lasting peace. At the
           same time, what practical things can you do for these people to
           help them see that they can surrender to God and that His way is
           the best? In other words, how can God use you to help others
           know of His love and willingness to provide?

Invited by an Angel
by BENJAMIN D. SCHOUN
   In the Muslim country of Azerbaijan, one family of new believers is
convinced that an angel guided them to the Adventist Church.
   A young woman named Gunel and her family had just lost their grand-
father. Her mother cried quietly as she rode the city bus to the family’s
grave site. A woman came to comfort her, saying that God is good, that
Jesus will come again, and that there is hope for the future. Then the
woman told Gunel’s mother about a church where she could go to learn
more about these things.
   A month later Gunel’s mother again saw the woman on the bus. The
woman again encouraged her and gave her the address of the church.
Gunel’s mother asked Gunel to go with her one Saturday morning to this
church. They had never been inside a Christian church before and hesi-
tated to enter. Then one of the church greeters saw them and invited them
in, where they were welcomed with hugs and kisses.
   Gunel and her mother enjoyed the worship. After the service Gunel’s
mother asked about the woman she had met on the bus. She described the
woman in detail, but no one recognized the description. The pastor, who
knew every Adventist in the city, listened carefully. He did not recognize
the woman’s description and suggested that Gunel’s mother had met an
angel.
   Gunel and her mother continued attending church and studied the Bible
diligently. First Gunel’s mother was baptized, then Gunel and her brother
and sister followed. Now they host a small group meeting in their home.
Gunel’s father, still a Muslim, is favorable to Adventists.
   Gunel’s Muslim friends harass her because she has become a Christian.
But Gunel is not deterred. Recently she took an Adventist World Radio
                              seminar to learn how to produce radio pro-
                              grams. Perhaps Gunel will be part of AWR’s
                              outreach into her homeland, where today just
                              a handful of believers live.

        LESSON           13 *December 22–28
      Christ in the Crucible




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 2:1–18; 27:51, 52;
      Luke 2:7, 22–24; 22:41–44; John 8:58, 59; Rom. 6:23; Titus 1:2.

Memory Text: “And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
      loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My
      God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46).


                henever we look at the issue of suffering, the question

      W         comes: How did sin and suffering first arise? Through
                divine revelation we have good answers: They arose because
      free beings abused the freedom God had given them. This leads to
      another question: Did God know beforehand that these beings would
      fall? Yes, but obviously He thought it was, as C. S. Lewis wrote,
      “worth the risk.”
         Worth the risk? For whom? For us, while God sits in heaven on His
      throne? Not exactly. The freedom of all His intelligent creatures was
      so sacred that, rather than deny us freedom, God agreed to bear in
      Himself the brunt of the suffering caused by our abuse of that free-
      dom. And we see that suffering in the life and death of Jesus, who,
      through suffering in our flesh, has created bonds between heaven and
      earth that will last throughout eternity.

The Week at a Glance: What did Christ suffer in our be-
      half? What can we learn from His suffering?

     The Early Days
       Scripture gives us little information about the early years of Jesus.
     A few verses, however, tell us something about those conditions and
     the kind of world the Savior entered.

Read Luke 2:7, 22–24 (see also Lev. 12:6–8) and Matthew 2:1–18.
     What do we see in these texts that gives us an indication of the
     kind of life Jesus faced from the start?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Of course, Jesus was not the first person to live in poverty or to face
     those who wanted to kill Him, even from an early age. There is, how-
     ever, another element that helps us understand the uniqueness of what
     Christ suffered from the earliest times.

Read John 1:46. What element does this add to help us understand
     what sufferings the young Jesus had faced?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       With the exception of Adam and Eve before the Fall, Jesus was the
     only sinless Person who ever lived on the earth. In His purity, in His
     sinlessness, He was immersed in a world of sin. What a torture it must
     have been, even as a child, for His pure soul constantly to be in con-
     tact with sin. Even in our hardness because of sin, we ourselves often
     shrink away at sins and evil that we find repulsive. Imagine what it
     must have been like for Christ, whose soul was pure, who wasn’t the
     least bit tainted by sin. Think of the sharp contrast between Christ and
     others around Him in that regard. It must have been exceedingly
     painful for Him.

      Ask yourself, “How sensitive am I to the sins that exist all
      around us? Does it bother me, or am I hardened to it?” If you
      are hardened to it, could it be because of the things you read,
      watch, or even do? Think about it.




                                                                         105
                 M ONDAY December 24

      Despised and Rejected of Men
Read the following texts, keeping in mind the whole time the fact that
      Jesus was divine, the Creator of heaven and earth and that He
      came to offer Himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world
      (Matt. 12:22–24; Luke 4:21–30; John 8:58, 59). How do these texts
      help us understand the sufferings that Jesus faced here on earth?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Whether by leaders, or even by the common people, Jesus’ life, acts,
      and teaching were constantly misunderstood, leading to rejection and
      hatred by people He came to save. In a certain sense it must be like a
      parent who sees a wayward child in need of help, and though the par-
      ent is willing to give everything for that child, the child spurns the par-
      ent, heaping scorn and rejection upon perhaps the only person who
      can spare that child from utter ruin. That’s what Jesus faced while here
      on earth. How painful it must have been for Him.

Read Matthew 23:37. What does that tell us about how Christ felt
      about the rejection? As you read, ask yourself, too, “Was He feel-
      ing bad for Himself [as we often do when facing rejection], or was
      it for another reason?” If for another reason, what was it?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         We’ve all felt the sting of rejection, and maybe our pain was simi-
      lar to Christ’s in that it was unselfish: We were pained not because we
      were rejected but because of what the rejection would mean for the
      one who was rejecting you (perhaps someone you care about who
      refuses to accept salvation in Christ). Imagine, though, what it must
      have felt to Jesus, who was fully aware of what He was to face in order
      to save them, and at the same time fully aware of what the conse-
      quences of their rejection would be. “It was because of His innocence
      that He [Christ] felt so keenly the assaults of Satan.”—Ellen G. White,
      Selected Messages, book 3, p. 129.

       What can you learn from Christ that can help you better cope
       with the pain of rejection? What does His example show you?
       How can you apply it to your own life?

     Jesus in Gethsemane
       “And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
     death: tarry ye here, and watch” (Mark 14:34).

       Whatever Jesus suffered through His 33 years here on earth, noth-
     ing compared to what He started to face in the last hours before the
     Cross. From the eternal ages (Eph. 1:1–4; 2 Tim. 1:8, 9; Titus 1:1, 2)
     the sacrifice of Jesus as the offering for the world’s sin was planned,
     and now it was all coming to pass.

What do the following texts tell us about Christ’s suffering in
     Gethsemane? Matt. 26:39, Mark 14:33–36, Luke 22:41–44.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       “He went a little distance from them—not so far but that they could
     both see and hear Him—and fell prostrate upon the ground. He felt
     that by sin He was being separated from His Father. The gulf was so
     broad, so black, so deep, that His spirit shuddered before it. This
     agony He must not exert His divine power to escape. As man He must
     suffer the consequences of man’s sin. As man He must endure the
     wrath of God against transgression.
       “Christ was now standing in a different attitude from that in which
     He had ever stood before. His suffering can best be described in the
     words of the prophet, ‘Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and
     against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.’ Zech. 13:7.
     As the substitute and surety for sinful man, Christ was suffering under
     divine justice. He saw what justice meant. Hitherto He had been as an
     intercessor for others; now He longed to have an intercessor for
     Himself.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 686.

      Dwell upon what was happening to Jesus in Gethsemane.Already
      the sins of the world were starting to fall upon Him. Try to imag-
      ine what that must have been like. No human being has ever been
      called to go through anything like this before. What does this tell
      us about God’s love for us? What hope can you draw from this for
      yourself?




                                                                        107
         W EDNESDAY December 26

      The Crucified God
        Death by crucifixion was one of the harshest punishments the
      Romans meted out to anyone. It was considered the worst way to die.
      Thus, how horrific for anyone to be killed that way, much less the Son
      of God! Jesus, we must always remember, came in human flesh like
      ours. Between the beatings, the scourgings, the nails hammered into
      His hands and feet, the harrowing weight of His own body tearing at
      the wounds, and the physical pain must have been unbearable. This
      was harsh, even for the worst of criminals; how unfair, then, that
      Jesus, innocent of everything, should face such a fate.
        Yet, as we know, Christ’s physical sufferings were mild in contrast
      to what was really happening. This was more than just the killing of
      an innocent man.

What events surrounding the death of Jesus showed that more was
      going on than most people there understood at the time? What
      significance can we find in each of these events that can help
      reveal what happened there?

      Matt. 27:45
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Matt. 27:51, 52

      Mark 15:38
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Clearly, something much more was happening here than just the
      death, however unfairly, of an innocent man. According to Scripture,
      God’s wrath against sin, our sin, was poured out upon Jesus. Jesus on
      the cross suffered not sinful humanity’s unjust wrath but a righteous
      God’s righteous indignation against sin, the sins of the whole world.
      As such, Jesus suffered something deeper, darker, and more painful
      than any human being could ever know or experience.

       As you go through whatever struggles you are facing, what hope
       and comfort can you draw from the reality of Christ suffering
       for you on the cross?

             T HURSDAY December 27

      The Suffering God
        We might as well get used to it: As long as we are here, in this world,
      we are going to suffer. It is, as fallen creatures, our fate. Nothing in
      the Bible promises us anything differently. On the contrary . . .

What do the following texts have to tell us about the topic at hand? Acts
      14:22, Phil. 1:29, 2 Tim. 3:12.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Yet, in the midst of our suffering, two things we should keep in
      mind.
        First, Christ, our Lord, has suffered worse than any of us ever could.
      At the Cross, He “has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows” (Isa.
      53:4, NKJV); what we know only as individuals, He suffered corpo-
      rately, for us all. He, who was sinless, became “sin for us” (2 Cor.
      5:21), suffering in a way that we, as sinful creatures, couldn’t begin to
      imagine.
        But second, as we suffer, we should remember the results of Christ’s
      suffering; that is, what we have been promised through what Christ
      has done for us.

Read John 10:28, Romans 6:23, Titus 1:2, and 1 John 2:25. What are
      we promised?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Whatever our sufferings here, thanks to Jesus, thanks to His bearing
      in Himself the punishment of our sin, thanks to the great provision of
      the gospel—that through faith we can stand perfect in Jesus right
      now—we have the promise of eternal life. We have the promise that
      because of what Christ has done, because of the fullness and com-
      pleteness of His perfect life and perfect sacrifice, our existence here,
      full of pain, disappointment, and loss, is no more than an instant, a
      flash, here and gone. In contrast to this, there is the eternity that awaits
      us, an eternity in a new heavens and a new earth, one without sin, suf-
      fering, and death. And all this is promised to us and made certain for
      us only because of Christ and the crucible He went into so that one
      day, coming soon, He would see “the travail of his soul, and shall be
      satisfied” (Isa. 53:11).



                                                                             109
                       F RIDAY December 28

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Gethsemane,” pp. 685–697;
          “Calvary,” pp. 741–757, in The Desire of Ages.

             “Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has humanity
          shrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now the history of the
          human race comes up before the world’s Redeemer. He sees that the
          transgressors of the law, if left to themselves, must perish. He sees the
          helplessness of man. He sees the power of sin. The woes and lamen-
1         tations of a doomed world rise before Him. He beholds its impending
          fate, and His decision is made. He will save man at any cost to
          Himself. He accepts His baptism of blood, that through Him perishing
          millions may gain everlasting life. He has left the courts of heaven,
          where all is purity, happiness, and glory, to save the one lost sheep, the
          one world that has fallen by transgression. And He will not turn from
2         His mission. He will become the propitiation of a race that has willed
          to sin. His prayer now breathes only submission: ‘If this cup may not
          pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.’ ”—Ellen G.
          White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 690, 693.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 How does it help us in our own sufferings, this knowledge that
           God Himself, in the person of Christ, suffered worse than any of
3          us ever could? What should the sufferings of Christ in our behalf
           mean to us? What comfort can we draw from this amazing
           truth? As you think about your answer, keep in mind the follow-
           ing statement from Ellen White: “All the suffering which is the
           result of sin was poured into the bosom of the sinless Son of
           God.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 3, p. 129.

           ●2 As a class, go over the sufferings of Christ looked at in this
           week’s lesson. What were the crucibles that Christ faced? In
           what ways are they like our own; in what ways are they different?
           What can we learn from how He handled these challenges that
           can help us amid our own crucibles?

           ●3 What are some of your favorite Bible promises, promises that
           you can cling to amid sorrow and pain? Write them out, claim
           them for yourself, and share them in class.

           ●4 Write out a summary paragraph, highlighting whatever few
           main points you got from this quarter’s lesson. What questions
           were resolved for you? What issues still remain unanswered?
           How can we help each other work through those things that still
           greatly perplex and trouble us?

Surprised by the Spirit
by GILBERT CANGY
    A couple of years ago, God showed up in a mysterious way while I was
ministering to young people. I had been invited to be the evening devo-
tional speaker for a regional youth congress on Ambrym, a remote island
belonging to Vanuatu, an island republic in the South Pacific.
   Although Ambrym is halfway between Australia and the island nation
of Fiji, it is still entrenched in its traditional village life. When we arrived,
we were greeted by the village chief, who offered us a giant yam, a baby
chick, and beautiful coconut juice—traditional welcoming gifts for visi-
tors, as he gave us permission to enter his territory.
   Soon the evening meetings began. I was surprised to find a large num-
ber of older village folk coming to the meetings. I knew most of them did
not speak English, but Bislama, their traditional language. Because the
young people attending the youth congress all speak English, no transla-
tion had been provided. I decided that these older folks had come to hear
the music and to support the youth in attendance.
   The week of meetings went well, and toward the end of the week, I
invited the youth to give their hearts to the Lord. Again I was surprised—
this time at the number of older people who responded to the call. Later I
expressed my appreciation for the support of the older folks, in spite of the
fact that they could hardly understand what was being said.
   “Oh, no,” the man responded. “They have understood every word.
Perhaps we should have told you that after your first night’s message,
some of the local elders came to ask us where you had learned Bislama.
They were pleased that you were preaching in their language.”
   I paused in humility and praise as I realized that I was seeing God work-
ing as He had during Pentecost. God knew that these older people needed
to hear His message of love and salvation, just as their youth needed to
hear.
   Mission is not dead. In some places it is as new as it was 2,000 years
ago when everyone heard God’s message in their own tongue. Your mis-
                                                       sion offerings make out-
                                                       reach to the farthest cor-
                                                       ners of the world possible.

2008    Bible Study Guide for the First Quarter

         Next quarter’s Bible study guide will look at discipleship as the
       experience between Jesus and those He called to apprenticeship
       with Him. Discipleship by Bertram Melbourne will explore the
       process of becoming a disciple, and what the major characteristics
       of discipleship are.

Lesson 1—An Overview of Discipleship
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Discipleship, Historical and Personal (Matt. 4:18–22,
       John 1:40–42, Acts 11:26)
       MONDAY: Who Is a Disciple?(Luke 14:25, 26)
       TUESDAY: How Does One Become a Disciple? (Matt. 4:18, 19;
       Mark 1:19, 20; 2:13, 14)
       WEDNESDAY: Requirements of Discipleship (Matt. 16:24, 25;
       Mark 8:34, 35; Luke 9:23)
       THURSDAY: The Essence of Discipleship (Matt. 10:32, 33; 22:37–40)
       Memory Text—Matthew                    4:18, 19
       Sabbath Gem: Those         who accept Christ and commit to the task
       of discipleship are called to live under complete surrender to His
       lordship in their lives. There is no room for retreat. It is a call to
       move “Forward ever, backward never.”


Lesson 2—Discipleship Then and Now
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Discipleship Among the Greeks (John 12:20, 21)
