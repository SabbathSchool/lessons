         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of worldwide evaluation committees and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

Redemption in Romans

H           e had been a monk, a diligent one at that. “I was indeed a pious monk,
            and followed the rules of my order more strictly than I can express. If ever
            a monk could attain Heaven by his monkish works, I should certainly
have been entitled to it. If I had continued much longer, I should have carried my
mortifications even to death.”
   No matter his works and mortifications, however, the monk never sensed accep-
tance with God, never believed that he was good enough to be saved. His personal
despair was so great that it was destroying him mentally and physically, because—
believing in the reality of God’s wrath—he feared the prospect of ever having to
face it.
   After all, who wouldn’t?
   Then one day, through his study of the Bible, a text jumped out at him that
changed not only his life but the history of the world. “The just shall live by faith”
(Rom. 1:17).
   His eyes had been opened: his acceptance with God was based not on his works,
not on his bodily mortifications, not on his deeds but on the merits of Christ.
Never again would he be open to the delusions of a theology that placed the hope
of salvation in anything other than the righteousness of Christ given to the believer
through faith alone.
   The monk, of course, was Martin Luther, who was used by God to start the great-
est religious revolt in Christian history: the Protestant Reformation.
   For Luther, it all began in the book of Romans, the topic of this quarter’s study.
It’s not surprising that the Protestant revolt against Rome began in Romans (ironi-
cally enough), because this book has played a key role in the history of Christian
thought. All great movements in Christianity—back to the pure gospel and to the
theme of “justification by faith”—have found their starting point in Paul’s Epistle
to the Romans. The epistle contains a complete theological presentation of the gos-
pel and of the hope it presents to fallen humanity.
   As we study Romans, we’ll follow a crucial rule,
and that is, we’ll seek to discover what the words of       All great movements
Scripture were meant to say to those to whom they           in Christianity—back
were first addressed. We’ll look at them in their           to the pure gospel and
immediate context; then, after that, we’ll seek their
                                                            to the theme of “justifi-
meaning for us today. This doesn’t imply that the
texts themselves change meanings; it implies, instead,      cation by faith”—have
that the truths taught by the Scriptures need to be         found their starting
applied to the present circumstances of those reading       point in Paul’s Epistle
the texts.                                                  to the Romans.
   We must, therefore, first discover what the words
of Paul meant to the Roman Christians. What was
he saying to them, and why? Paul had a particular reason for writing to that congre-
gation. There were certain issues he wished to clarify, but the great truths that he
taught as he clarified those issues were not restricted to only his first readers. On the
contrary, these words have reverberated across the centuries, teaching millions the
wonderful news of the gospel and its foundational doctrine, justification by faith. It
was this light, light from the book of Romans, that scattered the darkness that had
enveloped Luther and millions of others, light that revealed to them not only the
great truth of Christ pardoning sinners but also the power of Christ to cleanse them
from sin. And it’s light from these pages that we, this quarter, will seek to uncover
for ourselves as we study the great theme of salvation by faith alone as revealed in
the book of Romans.

   This quarter is based on previous work by Don Neufeld (1914–1980), who served
as associate editor of the Adventist Review for 13 years (1967–1980) and as one of the
editors of The SDA Bible Commentary.

     Paul and Rome




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 28:17–31; Rom. 1:7;
  15:14, 20–27; Ephesians 1; Phil. 1:12.
					
Memory Text: “First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for
  you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world”
  (Romans 1:8, NKJV).



     I
         deally, in our study of the book of Romans, after a study of the his-
         torical background, we should begin with Romans 1:1 and then go
         through the entire book verse by verse. Because only one quarter has
     been allotted to the study of the book, we have had to be selective in what
     parts we can study. The book could easily take four quarters, not one,
     to explore. Hence, only the key chapters, in which the basic message is
     contained, will be covered.
        It is extremely important that a student of the book of Romans under-
     stand the book’s historical background. Without that background, it will be
     difficult for the student to know what Paul is saying. Paul was writing to a
     specific group of Christians at a specific time for a specific reason; know-
     ing, as much as possible, that reason will greatly benefit us in our study.
        We must, in our imagination, go back in time, transport ourselves to
     Rome, become members of the congregation there, and then, as first-
     century church members, listen to Paul and the words that the Holy Spirit
     gave him at that time.
        Amazingly enough, though written a long time ago and in a whole
     other context, the book has messages relevant to God’s people today,
     in every land and in nearly every situation. Hence, we need to heed
     prayerfully the words written here and apply them to our lives.

     Date and Place
        Romans 16:1, 2 indicates that Paul probably wrote Romans in the city
     of Cenchreae, which was near the eastern port of Corinth, in Greece.
     Paul’s mention of Phoebe, a resident of greater Corinth, establishes that
     place as the likely background for the letter to the Romans.
        One of the purposes of establishing the city of origin of the New
     Testament epistles is to ascertain the date of writing. Because Paul
     traveled much, knowing where he was at a particular time gives us a
     clue to the date.
        Paul established the church at Corinth on his second missionary
     journey, a.d. 49–52 (see Acts 18:1–18). On his third journey, a.d.
     53–58, he visited Greece again (Acts 20:2, 3), and at this time he
     received an offering for the saints in Jerusalem near the end of his
     journey (Rom. 15:25, 26). The Epistle to the Romans was, then, writ-
     ten probably in the early months of a.d. 58.

What other important churches had Paul visited on his third mis-
     sionary journey? Acts 18:23.
       			

        Visiting the Galatian churches, Paul discovered that during his
     absence false teachers had convinced the members to submit to cir-
     cumcision and to keep to other precepts of the law of Moses. Fearing
     that his opponents might reach Rome before he arrived, Paul wrote
     a letter (Romans) to forestall the same tragedy happening in Rome.
     It is believed that the Epistle to the Galatians was written also from
     Corinth during Paul’s three months there on his third missionary jour-
     ney, perhaps shortly after his arrival.
        “In his epistle to the Romans, Paul set forth the great principles of the
     gospel. He stated his position on the questions which were agitating the
     Jewish and the Gentile churches, and showed that the hopes and promises
     which had once belonged especially to the Jews were now offered to the
     Gentiles also.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 373.
        As we said, it is important in the study of any book of the Bible
     to know why it was written; that is, what situation it was address-
     ing. Hence, it is important for our understanding of the Epistle to
     the Romans to know what questions were agitating the Jewish and
     Gentile churches. Next week’s lesson will deal with these questions.

      What kinds of issues are agitating your church at present? Are
      the threats more from without or from within? What role are you
      playing in these debates? How often have you stopped to question
      your role, your position, and your attitudes in whatever struggles
      you’re facing? Why is this kind of self-examination so important?

     Personal Touch
       A letter is one thing, a personal visit another. That’s why Paul,
     even though he wrote to the Romans, announced in the letter that he
     intended to see them in person. He wanted them to know that he was
     coming, and why.

Read Romans 15:20–27. What reasons does Paul give for not having
     visited Rome earlier? What made him decide to come when he
     did? How central was mission to him in his reasoning? What can
     we learn about mission and witnessing from Paul’s words here?
     What interesting—and important—point does Paul make in verse
     27 about Jews and Gentiles?

       The great missionary to the Gentiles felt constantly impelled to
     take the gospel to previously unentered areas, leaving others to labor
     in areas where the gospel had been established. In the days when
     Christianity was young and the laborers few, it would have been
     a waste of valuable missionary power for Paul to work in already
     entered areas. He said, “So have I strived to preach the gospel, not
     where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s
     foundation,” so that “they that have not heard shall understand” (Rom.
     15:20, 21).
       It was not Paul’s purpose to settle down in Rome. It was his aim
     to evangelize Spain. He hoped to get the support of the Christians in
     Rome for this venture.

What important principle can we take away for ourselves on the
     whole question of mission from the fact that Paul sought help
     from an established church in order to evangelize a new area?

      Read again the verses in Romans 15:20–27. Notice how much
      Paul wanted to serve; that is, his great desire was to minister
      and to serve. What motivates you and your actions? How much
      of a heart of service do you have?

     Paul Reaches Rome
“But when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to
     the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by him-
     self with the soldier who guarded him” (Acts 28:16, NKJV). What
     does this text tell us about how Paul finally got to Rome? What
     lesson can we draw from this for ourselves about the unexpected
     and unwanted things that so often come our way?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Life can take some very strange turns. How often our plans, even
     the ones formulated with the best of intentions, don’t come out as we
     anticipated and hoped for. The apostle Paul did, indeed, get to Rome,
     but it probably wasn’t as he had expected.
       When Paul reached Jerusalem at the end of his third missionary
     journey with his offering for the poor, which he collected from the
     congregations of Europe and Asia Minor, unexpected events awaited
     him. He was arrested and fettered. After being held prisoner for two
     years at Caesarea, he appealed to Caesar. Some three years after his
     arrest, he arrived in Rome, and (we can assume) not in the manner that
     he intended to when he first wrote to the Roman church years before
     about his intention to visit them.

What do the following texts tell us about Paul’s time in Rome? More
     important, what lesson can we learn from them? Acts 28:17–31.

        “Not by Paul’s sermon[s], but by his bonds, was the attention of the
     court attracted to Christianity. It was as a captive that he broke from so
     many souls the bonds that held them in the slavery of sin. Nor was this
     all. He declared: ‘Many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident
     by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.’
     Philippians 1:14.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 464.

      How many times have you experienced unexpected twists in
      your life that, in the end, turned out for good? (See Phil. 1:12.)
      How can, and should, those experiences give you faith to trust
      God for the things from which no good seems to have arisen?

      Called to Be “Saints”
Here is Paul’s salutation to the church in Rome. “To all that be in Rome,
      beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God
      our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 1:7). What principles of
      truth, of theology, of faith, can we take away from his words here?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Beloved of God. While it is true that God loves the world, in a
      special sense God loves those who have chosen Him, those who have
      responded to His love.
         We see this in the human sphere. We love in a special way those
      who love us; with them there is a mutual exchange of affection. Love
      demands response. When the response is not forthcoming, love is
      limited in its fullest expression.
         Called to be saints. In some translations the phrase “to be” is in
      italics, which means that the translators have supplied the words. But
      they can be left out with the meaning intact. When they are omitted,
      we get the expression “called saints”; that is, “designated saints.”
         “Saints” is the translation of the Greek hagioi, which literally means
      “holy ones.” Holy means “dedicated.” A saint is one who has been “set
      apart” by God. He or she still may have a long way to go in sanctifica-
      tion, but the fact that this person has chosen Christ as the Lord desig-
      nates him or her as a saint in the Bible’s meaning of the term.

Paul says that they were “called to be saints.” Does this mean that
      some people are not called? How do Ephesians 1:4, Hebrews 2:9,
      and 2 Peter 3:9 help us understand what Paul means?


         The great news of the gospel is that Christ’s death was universal; it was
      for all human beings. All have been called to be saved in Him, “called to
      be saints,” even before the foundation of the world. God’s original inten-
      tion was for all humanity to find salvation in Jesus. The final fire of hell
      was meant only for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). That some folk
      don’t avail themselves of what was offered doesn’t take away from the
      wonder of the gift any more than someone who goes on a hunger strike in
      a marketplace takes away from the wonderful bounties found there.

       Think about it: even before the foundation of the world, God called
       you to have salvation in Him. Why should you not allow anything,
       anything at all, to hold you back from heeding that call?

     World Reputation
       “First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
     your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world” (Rom. 1:8).

        It is not known how the congregation in Rome became established.
     The tradition that the church was founded by Peter or Paul is without
     historical foundation. Perhaps lay persons established it, converts on
     the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem (Acts 2) who then visited or moved
     to Rome. Or perhaps at some later period converts moving to Rome
     witnessed to their faith in that world capital.
        It is surprising that, in a few decades from Pentecost, a congregation
     that apparently had received no apostolic visit should be so widely
     known. “Notwithstanding the opposition, twenty years after the cruci-
     fixion of Christ there was a live, earnest church in Rome. This church
     was strong and zealous, and the Lord worked for it.”—Ellen G. White
     Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1067.
        “Faith” here probably includes the broader sense of faithfulness; that
     is, faithfulness to the new way of life they had discovered in Christ.

Read Romans 15:14. How does Paul there describe the church at
     Rome?
      		

        Paul selects three items as worthy of note in the Roman Christians’
     experience:
        1. “Full of goodness.” Would people say this of our own experi-
     ence? As they associate with us, is it the abundance of goodness in us
     that attracts their attention?
        2. “Filled with all knowledge.” The Bible repeatedly emphasizes the
     importance of enlightenment, information, and knowledge. Christians
     are urged to study the Bible and to become well-informed as to its
     teachings. “The words, ‘A new heart also will I give you,’ mean, ‘A
     new mind will I give you.’ A change of heart is always attended by a
     clear conviction of Christian duty, an understanding of truth.”—Ellen G.
     White, My Life Today, p. 24.
        3. “Able . . . to admonish one another.” No one can thrive spiritu-
     ally if isolated from fellow believers. We need to be able to encourage
     others and, at the same time, be encouraged by others.

      What about your local church? What kind of reputation does
      it have? Or, even more important, does it even have one at all?
      What does your answer tell you about your local church? More
      important, if need be, how can you help improve the situation?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Mysteries of the
         Bible,” p. 706, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5; “Salvation to the
         Jews,” pp. 372–374, in The Acts of the Apostles. Read also The SDA
         Bible Dictionary, p. 922; and The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
         pp. 467, 468.

           “While apparently cut off from active labor, Paul exerted a wider
         and more lasting influence than if he had been free to travel among the
         churches as in former years. As a prisoner of the Lord, he had a firmer
         hold upon the affections of his brethren; and his words, written by one
         under bonds for the sake of Christ, commanded greater attention and
1        respect than they did when he was personally with them.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 454.
           “To see the Christian faith firmly established at the great center of
         the known world was one of his dearest hopes and most cherished
         plans. A church had already been established in Rome, and the apostle
         desired to secure the co-operation of the believers there in the work
2        to be accomplished in Italy and in other countries. To prepare the
         way for his labors among these brethren, many of whom were as
         yet strangers to him, he sent them a letter announcing his purpose of
         visiting Rome and his hope of planting the standard of the cross in
         Spain.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 373.
           “The eternal God has drawn the line of distinction between the saint
         and the sinner, between converted and unconverted. The two classes
         do not blend into each other imperceptibly, like the colors of a rain-
3        bow, but are as distinct as midday and midnight.”—Ellen G. White,
         Messages to Young People, p. 390.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Dwell on the question at the end of Thursday’s lesson. How
          could your class help improve your church’s reputation, if need
          be?

          l2 In class, share experiences about how a situation that at first
          seemed terrible was able to be turned to good. How can you use
          these experiences to help others who are struggling with unex-
          pected calamities?

          l
          3 Dwell more on the idea that we were called to have salvation,
          even before the foundation of the world (see also Titus 1:1, 2;
          2 Tim. 1:8, 9). Why should we find this so encouraging? What
          does this tell us about God’s love for all humans? Why, then, is
          it so tragic when people turn their backs on what has been so
          graciously offered them?

Getting to Know God
   Ariuntuya laughed at her older sister. “You are going to a Christian
meeting?” she asked accusingly. “You used to mock people who didn’t
recite traditional prayers!” Ariuntuya’s sister, Moogli, ignored her younger
sister’s taunts.
   Ariuntuya’s family lives in Mongolia. A school friend had invited Moogli
to attend a Seventh-day Adventist worship service held in a rented hall,
and Moogli went. She liked the program and invited her sister to go with
her. Ariuntuya went, and she had to admit that she liked it. But she pre-
ferred to sleep late rather than attend a religious program.
   Moogli continued attending the meetings. When some evangelists came
to the city several months later, Moogli again invited Ariuntuya to attend.
This time Ariuntuya attended with Moogli. Ariuntuya enjoyed the music
and felt the love of the church members.
   Slowly Ariuntuya realized that church was more than a social club; it
was about having a personal relationship with God. Ariuntuya began to
consider how God would fit into her life.
   When the family moved to the capital city, the sisters found an
Adventist church to attend. Ariuntuya’s mother had never approved of the
girls attending a Christian church. But when the young Adventist pastor
hired the girls’ mother to care for his children, she began attending church
with her daughters. Ariuntuya had never really thought about praying for
her mother, so she was surprised at her mother’s change of attitude.
   “I realize now that God has been working in my life,” Ariuntuya admits.
“I realize that He works in other people’s lives, even when we see no out-
ward sign of it. I am learning to give God first place in my life. Now I pray
for my parents to become Christians, and I invite others to consider giving
their lives to God too. I’m glad that my sister kept inviting me, even when
I made fun of her and refused to go.”
                                 The Adventist Church in Mongolia is
                              young, and members rely on the world church
                              to help them grow. Your mission offerings
                              to this frontline mission field are making a
                              huge difference in the lives of people such as
                              Ariuntuya and her family.

        Lesson             2      *July 3–9



     Jew and Gentile




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Leviticus 23, Matt. 19:17,
     Acts 15:1–29, Gal. 1:1–12, Heb. 8:6, Rev. 12:17.

Memory Text: “The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth
     came by Jesus Christ” (John 1:17).



     T
             he first converts to Christianity were all Jews, and the New
             Testament gives no indication that they were asked to drop the
             practice of circumcision or to ignore the Jewish festivals. But
     when the Gentiles began to accept Christianity, important questions
     arose. Should the Gentiles submit to circumcision? To what extent
     should they keep other Jewish laws? Finally, a council was called at
     Jerusalem to settle the matter (see Acts 15).
        Despite a firm decision by the council not to trouble the Gentiles
     with a host of regulations and laws, some teachers continued to
     plague the churches by insisting that Gentile converts to the faith were
     required to keep these rules and laws, including circumcision.
        In some ways, these issues exist today, only in a different form. How
     often are we, as Seventh-day Adventists, accused of being Judaizers,
     or legalists, because of our adherence to the Ten Commandments (or,
     in actuality, our adherence to the Sabbath commandment)? How often
     do we hear that we are now under the New Covenant, and so the law
     (the Sabbath commandment) has been done away with?
        On the other side, at times as a church we are confronted with those
     who would like to impose more Old Testament rules and regulations
     on us, as well.
        Hence, Romans certainly has an important message for us today, as
     it did for the Roman church back then.

      Better Promises
Read Hebrews 8:6. What is the message here? How do we under-
      stand what these “better promises” are?

      _______________________________________________________

         Perhaps the greatest difference between the religion of the Old
      Testament and that of the New is the fact that the New Testament era
      was introduced by the coming of the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth. He
      was sent by God to be the Savior. Men could not ignore Him and expect
      to be saved. Only through the atonement He provided could they have
      their sins forgiven. Only by the imputation of His perfect life could they
      stand before God without condemnation. In other words, salvation was
      through the righteousness of Jesus, and nothing else.
         Old Testament saints looked forward to the blessings of the
      Messianic age and the promise of salvation. In New Testament times,
      the people were confronted with the question, Would they accept
      Jesus of Nazareth whom God had sent as the Messiah, their Savior? If
      they believed in Him—that is, if they accepted Him for who He truly
      was and committed themselves to Him—they would be saved through
      the righteousness that He offers them freely.
         Meanwhile, the moral requirements remain unchanged in the New
      Testament, because these were founded in the character of God and
      of Christ. Obedience to God’s moral law is just as much a part of the
      New Covenant as of the Old.

Read Matthew 19:17; Revelation 12:17; 14:12; and James 2:10, 11. What
      do these texts tell us about the moral law in the New Testament?

      _______________________________________________________

         At the same time, the entire body of ritual and ceremonial laws that
      were distinctly Israelite, that were distinctly tied to the Old Covenant,
      all of which pointed to Jesus and to His death and ministry as High
      Priest, were discontinued, and a new order was introduced, one based
      on “better promises.”
         Helping both Jew and Gentile to understand what was involved in this
      transition from Judaism to Christianity was one of Paul’s principal aims
      in the book of Romans. It would take time to make the transition.

       What are some of your favorite Bible promises? How often do
       you claim them? What choices are you making that can stand in
       the way of having these promises fulfilled in your life?

      Jewish Laws and Regulations
As time allows, skim through the book of Leviticus. (See, for instance,
      Leviticus 12, 16, 23.) What thoughts come to your mind as you
      read all these rules and regulations and rituals? Why would many
      of these be all but impossible to follow in New Testament times?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         It is convenient for us to classify Old Testament laws into various
      categories: (1) moral law, (2) ceremonial law, (3) civil law, (4) stat-
      utes and judgments, and (5) health laws.
         This classification is, in part, artificial. In actuality, some of these
      categories are interrelated, and there is considerable overlap. The
      ancients did not see them as separate and distinct.
         The moral law is summed up by the Ten Commandments (Exod.
      20:1–17). This law sums up the moral requirements of humanity.
      These ten precepts are amplified and applied in various statutes and
      judgments throughout the first five books of the Bible. These ampli-
      fications show what it meant to keep the law of God in various situ-
      ations. Not unrelated are the civil laws. These, too, are based on the
      moral law. These define a citizen’s relationship to civil authorities
      and to his or her fellow citizens. They name the penalties for various
      infractions.
         The ceremonial law regulated the sanctuary ritual, describing the
      various offerings and the individual citizen’s responsibilities. The
      feast days are specified and their observance defined.
         The health laws overlap the other laws. The various laws relating
      to uncleanness define ceremonial uncleanness, and yet go beyond this
      to include hygienic and health principles. Laws regarding clean and
      unclean meats are based on physical considerations.
         While the Jew probably largely thought of all these laws as a pack-
      age, having all come from God, he or she must have made certain
      distinctions mentally. The Ten Commandments had been spoken by
      God directly to the people. This would set them apart as especially
      important. The other laws had been relayed through Moses. The sanc-
      tuary ritual could be kept only while a sanctuary was in operation.
         The civil laws, at least in large part, could no longer be imposed after
      the Jews lost their independence and came under the civil control of
      another nation. Many of the ceremonial precepts could no longer be
      observed after the temple was destroyed. Also, after the Messiah came,
      many of the types had met their antitypes and no longer had validity.

     “What Must I Do to Be Saved?”
Read Acts 15:1. What issue was causing dissension? Why would some
     people believe that this wasn’t just for the Jewish nation? See
     Gen. 17:10.

     _______________________________________________________

       While the apostles united with the ministers and lay members at
     Antioch in an earnest effort to win many souls to Christ, certain
     Jewish believers from Judaea “of the sect of the Pharisees” succeeded
     in introducing a question that soon led to widespread controversy in
     the church and brought consternation to the believing Gentiles. With
     great assurance these teachers asserted that in order to be saved,
     one must be circumcised and must keep the entire ceremonial law.
     The Jews, after all, always had prided themselves on their divinely
     appointed services, and many of those who had been converted to the
     faith of Christ still felt that since God had once clearly outlined the
     Hebrew manner of worship, it was improbable that He would ever
     authorize a change in any of its specifications. They insisted that the
     Jewish laws and ceremonies should be incorporated into the rites of
     the Christian religion. They were slow to discern that all the sacrificial
     offerings had but prefigured the death of the Son of God, in which
     type met antitype, and after which the rites and ceremonies of the
     Mosaic dispensation were no longer binding.

Read Acts 15:2–12. How was this dispute to be settled?

     _______________________________________________________

        “While looking to God for direct guidance, he [Paul] was ever ready to
     recognize the authority vested in the body of believers united in church
     fellowship. He felt the need of counsel, and when matters of importance
     arose, he was glad to lay these before the church and to unite with his
     brethren in seeking God for wisdom to make right decisions.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 200.
        It’s interesting that Paul, who often talked about his prophetic call-
     ing and how Jesus had called him and gave him his mission, was so
     willing to work with the larger church body. That is, whatever his
     calling, he realized that he was part of the church as a whole and that
     he needed to work with it as much as possible.

      What is your attitude toward church leadership? How coop-
      erative are you? Why is cooperation so important? How could
      we function if everyone was doing only what he or she wanted,
      independent of the larger body?

      “No Greater Burden”			
Read Acts 15:5–29. What decision did the council come to, and what
      was its reasoning?

      _______________________________________________________

     The decision was against the contentions of the Judaizers. These
   folk insisted that the Gentile converts be circumcised and keep the
   entire ceremonial law, and that “the Jewish laws and ceremonies should
   be incorporated into the rites of the Christian religion.”—Ellen G.
   White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 189.
     It’s interesting to note in verse 10 how Peter depicted these old
   laws as a “yoke” that they were unable to bear. Would the Lord, who
   instituted those laws, make them a yoke on His people? That hardly
   seems so. Instead, over the years some of the leaders had, through
   their oral traditions, turned many of the laws, which were meant to
   be blessings, into burdens. The council sought to spare Gentiles from
   these burdens.
     Notice, too, that there was no mention or question of the Gentiles
   not needing to obey the Ten Commandments. After all, could we
   imagine the council telling them not to eat blood, but that it was
   acceptable to ignore the commandments against adultery or murder
   and the like?
     		
What rules were placed on the Gentile believers (Acts 15:20, 29), and
   why these specific ones?

      _______________________________________________________

         Although Jewish believers weren’t to impose their rules and tradi-
      tions on Gentiles, the council wanted to make sure that the Gentiles
      didn’t do things that would have been deemed offensive to the Jews
      who were united with them in Jesus. The apostles and elders, there-
      fore, agreed to instruct the Gentiles by letter to abstain from meats
      offered to idols, from fornication, from things strangled, and from
      blood. Some say that, because Sabbath keeping wasn’t specifically
      mentioned, it must not have been meant for the Gentiles (of course,
      the commandments against lying and murder weren’t specifically
      mentioned either, so that argument means nothing).

       Could we, in some ways, be laying burdens on people that are
       not necessary but are more from tradition than divine com-
       mand? If so, how? Bring your thoughts to class on Sabbath.

      The Galatian Heresy
         However clear the counsel, there were those who sought to go their
      own way and who continued to advocate that the Gentiles keep Jewish
      traditions and laws. For Paul, this became a very serious matter; that
      is, it wasn’t trifling over the fine points of faith. It had become a
      denial of the gospel of Christ itself.

Read Galatians 1:1–12. How serious does Paul see the issue he is con-
      fronting in Galatia? What should that tell us about how impor-
      tant this question is?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         As stated before, the Galatian situation in large degree prompted
      the content of the letter to Rome. In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul
      further develops the theme of the Galatian epistle. The Judaizers were
      contending that the law God had given them through Moses was
      important and should be observed by Gentile converts. Paul was try-
      ing to show its true place and function. He didn’t want these people
      to gain a foothold in Rome as they had done in Galatia.
         It is an oversimplification to ask whether in Galatians and Romans
      Paul is speaking of ceremonial or moral laws. Historically, the argu-
      ment was whether or not Gentile converts should be required to be
      circumcised and keep the law of Moses. The Jerusalem council had
      already ruled on this question, but some refused to follow its decision.
      Some read in Paul’s letters to the Galatians and the Romans evidence
      that the moral law, the Ten Commandments (or, in truth, only the
      fourth commandment), is no longer binding on Christians. Yet, they
      are missing the point of the letters, missing the historical context
      and issues that Paul was addressing. Paul, as we’ll see, stressed that
      salvation was by faith alone and not by keeping the law, even the
      moral law—yet that isn’t the same thing as saying that the moral law
      shouldn’t be kept. Obedience to the Ten Commandments was never
      an issue; those who make it one are reading back into texts a contem-
      porary issue, one that Paul wasn’t dealing with.

       How do you respond to those who claim the Sabbath is no longer
       binding upon Christians? How can you show the truth of the
       Sabbath in a way that complements the integrity of the gospel?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Jew and Gentile,” pp. 188–192,
         194–197; “Apostasy in Galatia,” pp. 383–388, in The Acts of the
         Apostles; “The Law Given to Israel,” pp. 310–312; “The Law and the

         People,” pp. 27–30, in The Desire of Ages.

            “But if the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of redemp-
         tion, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? In their bondage

            “The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts, and
         that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep God’s law;
         and they readily entered into covenant with God.”—Ellen G. White,
         Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 371, 372.
            “Through the influence of false teachers who had arisen among the
         believers in Jerusalem, division, heresy, and sensualism were rapidly
2
         gaining ground among the believers in Galatia. These false teachers
         were mingling Jewish traditions with the truths of the gospel. Ignoring
         the decision of the general council at Jerusalem, they urged upon the
         Gentile converts the observance of the ceremonial law.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 383.

    Discussion Questions:

          l
          1 In class, go over your answer to Wednesday’s final question. In
          what ways might your local church or you in your own home or
          maybe even you with yourself be laying burdens on others (or on
          yourself) that are not necessary? How can we recognize whether we
          are really doing these things? Or might we be in danger of going too
          far the other way? That is, how can we recognize whether we have
          become too lax in our lifestyle and standards to the point where our
          lives don’t reflect the high calling that we have in Christ?

          l
          2 What are some of the arguments folk use to claim that the Ten
          Commandments are no longer binding on Christians today? How
          do we answer those claims? Why, on the face of it, are those claims
          so wrong, and why in many cases do those who make such claims
          not really live as though they believe the Ten Commandments are
          no longer binding?
          								
          l3 Read again the first 12 verses in Galatians 1. Notice how uncom-
          promising and how fervent Paul was regarding his understanding
          of the gospel. What should that tell us about how, at times, we must
          stand absolutely unwavering in certain beliefs, especially in a day
          and age of pluralism and relativism? How does this show that cer-
          tain teachings cannot be compromised in any way?

Adventists Join the MOB
  Michael Surak, an Adventist from Pennsylvania, recently joined the
MOB. So did Edgar and Joycie Lao of Texas. In fact, more than 320
Adventists across North America have joined the MOB and are experienc-
ing a fulfilling ministry.
  Missionaries Of the Blind (MOB) is an arm of Christian Record
Services, the Adventist church’s ministry to the blind. MOB connects
Adventists across North America with the 23,000 blind and visually-
impaired people who receive Braille, large print, or audio publications
from Christian Record Services. Volunteers spend one or two hours a
month visiting blind or visually impaired people in their communities,
building friendships and praying with them.
  Michael visits Carl, a 31-year-old man who has been blind since birth.
“Carl has such a cheerful spirit,” Michael says. “I thought I would uplift
him, but he uplifted me.”
  “So many blind people receive materials from Christian Record on a
regular basis,” says Pastor David Klinedinst, personal ministries director
for Christian Record. “Some of them even attend our camps for the blind
program. We want to reach out to the people we serve and connect them
with a local Seventh-day Adventist church where they can find fellow-
ship, friendship, and worship.”
  “Most blind people are eager for a visit,” Klinedinst says. “They receive
Christian Record’s materials regularly, so when visitors identify them-
selves as volunteers with Christian Record, they are welcome. MOB is a
wonderful way to be involved in an outreach ministry and make friends
for Jesus.”
  Edgar and Joycie Lao had tried to start a Bible study group in Texas,
but they found most people too busy to attend. Then they joined MOB.
The first blind person Edgar became friends with was Raul, a bird watcher
who “watches” birds with his ears. Edgar went bird watching with Raul
and was introduced to other blind birders. He prayed with the group and
invited them to church. Among the group of blind birders was a young
woman named Gladie. Edgar offered to sign her up to receive the free
books and magazines Christian Record provides. She accepted the offer
and enjoys receiving the free materials. Soon Edgar invited Gladie to
church, and she came, along with two of her sisters and her nephew.
Gladie has since been baptized.
  Your mission offerings help support the ministry of Christian Record
Services.
Christian Record Services, the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s ministry to the blind and
visually impaired, is located in Lincoln, Nebraska. If you would like to visit a blind person,
visit mob.christianrecord.org, or call 402-488-0981.

     All Have Sinned




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 1:16, 17, 22–32; 2:1–
     10, 17–23; 3:1, 2, 10–18, 23.
Memory Text: “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of
     God” (Romans 3:23).
        					


     U
              nless a person acknowledges that he or she is unrighteous, that
              person will sense no need for justification (God’s declaration
              of a sinner as righteous in His eyes). Therefore, for Paul, the
     first step in justification is that a person recognize himself or herself
     as a helpless, hopeless sinner. In building this argument, Paul presents
     first the terrible depravity of the Gentiles. These have sunk as low as
     they have because they have pushed God from their memories. Paul
     then shows that the Jews are just as bad, the point being that none can
     save themselves with their good works.
        Ellen G. White makes it so clear: “Let no one take the limited,
     narrow position that any of the works of man can help in the least
     possible way to liquidate the debt of his transgression. This is a fatal
     deception. If you would understand it, you must cease haggling over
     your pet ideas, and with humble hearts survey the atonement.
        “This matter is so dimly comprehended that thousands upon thou-
     sands claiming to be sons of God are children of the wicked one,
     because they will depend on their own works. God always demanded
     good works, the law demands it, but because man placed himself in
     sin where his good works were valueless, Jesus’ righteousness alone
     can avail. Christ is able to save to the uttermost because He ever liveth
     to make intercession for us.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA
     Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1071.

Not Ashamed of the Gospel
   “I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is the power of God for sal-
vation to every one who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the
Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith
for faith; as it is written, ‘He who through faith is righteous shall
live’ ” (Rom. 1:16, 17, RSV). What do these verses say to you? How
have you experienced the promises and hope found in them?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

   Several key words occur in this passage:
   1. Gospel. This word is the translation of a Greek word meaning
literally “good message” or “good news.” Standing alone, the word
may refer to any good message; but modified as it is in this passage by
the phrase “of Christ,” it means “the good news about the Messiah”
(Christ is the transliteration of the Greek word meaning “Messiah”).
The good news is that the Messiah has come and all people may be
saved by believing in Him. In Jesus and in His perfect righteousness—
and not in ourselves, or even in God’s law—can one find salvation.
   2. Righteousness. This word refers to the quality of being “right”
with God. A specialized meaning of this word is developed in the
book of Romans, which we shall bring out as our study of the book
proceeds. It should be pointed out that in Romans 1:17, the word is
qualified by the phrase “of God.” It is righteousness that comes from
God, a righteousness that God Himself has provided. As we’ll see,
this is the only righteousness good enough to bring us the promise of
eternal life.
   3. Faith. In Greek the words translated believe and faith (KJV) in
this passage are the verb and noun forms of the same word: pisteuo
(“believe”), pistis (“belief ” or “faith”). The meaning of faith as related
to salvation will unfold as we progress in the study of Romans.
   		
  Do you ever struggle with assurance? Do you have times when
  you truly question whether or not you are saved, or even if
  you can be saved? What brings these fears? What are they
  grounded on? Might they be grounded in reality? That is, could
  you be living a lifestyle that denies your profession of faith? If
  so, what choices must you make in order to have the promises
  and assurances that are for you in Jesus?

      The Human Condition
Read Romans 3:23. Why is this message so easy for us, as Christians,
      to believe today? At the same time, what could cause some people
      to question the truthfulness of this text?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Amazingly enough, some folk actually challenge the idea of human
      sinfulness, arguing that people are basically good. The problem, however,
      stems from not understanding what true goodness is. People can
      compare themselves to someone else and feel good about themselves.
      Even the mobster Al Capone was a saint compared to Adolph Hitler.
      However, when we contrast ourselves to God, and to the holiness and
      righteousness of God, none of us would come away with anything
      other than an overwhelming sense of self-loathing and disgust.
         The verse also talks about “the glory of God.” The phrase has been
      variously interpreted. Perhaps the simplest interpretation is to give
      the phrase the meaning it has in 1 Corinthians 11:7, “He [man] is the
      image and glory of God” (RSV). In Greek, the word for “glory” may
      be considered as loosely equivalent to the word for “image.” Sin has
      marred the image of God in man. Sinful man falls far short of reflect-
      ing the image or glory of God.

Read Romans 3:10–18. Has anything changed today? Which of those
      depictions best describes you, or what you would be like were it
      not for Christ in your life?


        As bad as we are, our situation is not hopeless. The first step is for
      us to acknowledge our utter sinfulness and also our helplessness in and
      of ourselves to do anything about it. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to
      bring about such conviction. If the sinner does not resist Him, the Spirit
      will lead the sinner to tear away the mask of self-defense, pretense, and
      self-justification and to cast himself or herself upon Christ, pleading
      His mercy: “ ‘ “God, be merciful to me, the sinner!” ’ ” (Luke 18:13,
      NASB).

       When was the last time you took a good hard cold look at your-
       self, your motives, your deeds, and your feelings? This can be a
       very distressing experience, can’t it? What’s your only hope?

     From the First to the Twenty-first
     Century
       At the turn of the twentieth century, folk lived with the idea that
     humanity was improving, that morality would increase, and that sci-
     ence and technology would help usher in a utopia. Human beings, it
     was believed, were essentially on the path toward perfection; that is,
     through the right kind of education and moral training, humans could
     improve themselves and their society. All this was supposed to start
     happening, en masse, as we entered into the brave new world of the
     twentieth century.
       Unfortunately, things didn’t quite turn out that way, did they? The
     twentieth century was one of the most violent and barbaric in all his-
     tory, thanks—ironically enough—in great part to the advances of sci-
     ence, which made it much more possible for people to kill others on
     a scale that the most depraved madmen of the past could only dream
     about.
       What was the problem?

Read Romans 1:22–32. In what ways do we see the things written
     there, in the first century, being manifested today in the twenty-
     first century?

       When humanity lost sight of God, a floodgate of sin and error and
     degradation opened. We, today, each of us, are living the conse-
     quences of that problem. In fact, unless we are moment by moment
     surrendered to God, we become part of the problem, as well.

      Focus specifically on Romans 1:22, 23. How do we see this
      principle being manifested now? By rejecting God, what have
      humans in our century come to worship and idolize instead?
      And, in so doing, how have they become fools? Bring your
      answer to class on Sabbath.

     Jews and Gentiles Together
       In Romans 1, Paul was dealing specifically with the sins of the
     Gentiles, the pagans, those who had lost sight of God a long time ago
     and, thus, fallen into the most degrading practices.
       But he wasn’t going to let his own people, his own countrymen, off
     the hook either. Despite all the advantages that they had been given
     (Rom. 3:1, 2), they, too, were sinners, condemned by God’s law, and
     in need of the saving grace of Christ. In that sense, in the sense of
     being sinners, of having violated God’s law, and of needing divine
     grace for salvation, Jews and Gentiles are the same.

Read Romans 2:1–3, 17–24. What is Paul warning against here?
     What message should all of us, Jew or Gentile, take from this
     warning?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       “Do not think yourself better than other men, and set yourself up as
     their judge. Since you cannot discern motive, you are incapable of judg-
     ing another. In criticizing him, you are passing sentence upon yourself;
     for you show that you are a participant with Satan, the accuser of the
     brethren.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 314.
       It’s often so easy to see the sins of others and to point them out.
     How often, though, are we guilty of the same kinds of things, or even
     worse? The problem is that we tend to turn a blind eye on ourselves,
     or we make ourselves feel better by looking at just how bad others are
     in contrast to ourselves.
       Paul will have none of that. He warns his countrymen not to be
     quick to judge the Gentiles, for they, the Jews—even as the chosen
     people—were sinners, in some cases even more guilty than the pagans
     they were so quick to condemn because, as Jews, they had been given
     more light than the Gentiles.
       Paul’s point in all this is that none of us is righteous, none of us
     meets the divine standard, none of us is innately good or inherently
     holy. Jew or Gentile, male or female, rich or poor, God-fearing or
     God-rejecting, we all are condemned, and were it not for the grace of
     God, as revealed in the gospel, there would be no hope for any of us.

      How big of a hypocrite are you? That is, how often do you, even
      if only in your own mind, condemn others for things that you,
      yourself, are guilty of? How, by taking heed of what Paul has
      written here, can you change?

     Repentance
       A five-year-old boy pushed his little sister down, and the parents
     made him say he was sorry. He didn’t want to, and out of the side
     of his mouth, with no sincerity and gaze boring into the ground, he
     barely squeezed out, “Sorry.” Hardly true repentance, for sure.

With that story in mind, read the following: “Despisest thou the
     riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not
     knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”
     (Rom. 2:4). What message is here for us?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       We should notice that God’s goodness leads, not forces, sinners to
     repentance. God uses no coercion. He is infinitely patient and seeks
     to draw all men by His love. A forced repentance would destroy the
     whole purpose of repentance, would it not? If God forced repentance,
     then would not everyone be saved, for why would He force some and
     not others to repent?

What comes to those who resist God’s love, refuse to repent, and
  remain in disobedience? Rom. 2:5–10.

        In these verses, and frequently throughout the book of Romans, Paul
     emphasizes the place of good works. Justification by faith without the
     deeds of the law must never be construed to mean that good works
     have no place in the Christian life. For instance, in verse 7, salvation
     is described as coming to those who seek for it “by patient continu-
     ance in well doing.” Though human effort can’t bring salvation, it is
     part of the whole experience of salvation. It’s hard to see how anyone
     can read the Bible and come away with the idea that works and deeds
     don’t matter at all. True repentance, the kind that comes willingly
     from the heart, always will be followed by a determination to over-
     come and put away the things that we need to repent of.

      How often are you in an attitude of repentance? Is it sincere, or
      do you tend just to brush off your faults, shortcomings, and sins?
      If the latter, how can you change? Why must you change?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Lord’s Vineyard,” pp.
         291–294, in Christ’s Object Lessons; “God’s Love for Man,” pp. 9–15;
         “The Sinner’s Need of Christ,” pp. 17–22, in Steps to Christ; “In
         Contact With Others,” pp. 492–494, in The Ministry of Healing;
         “Agents of Satan,” pp. 146, 147, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5.

            “Many are deceived concerning the condition of their hearts. They
         do not realize that the natural heart is deceitful above all things, and
         desperately wicked. They wrap themselves about with their own righ-
         teousness, and are satisfied in reaching their own human standard of
1        character; but how fatally they fail when they do not reach the divine
         standard, and of themselves they cannot meet the requirements of
         God.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 320.
            “A terrible picture of the condition of the world has been presented
         before me. Immorality abounds everywhere. Licentiousness is the
         special sin of this age. Never did vice lift its deformed head with such
2        boldness as now. The people seem to be benumbed, and the lovers
         of virtue and true goodness are nearly discouraged by its boldness,
         strength, and prevalence. The iniquity which abounds is not merely
         confined to the unbeliever and the scoffer. Would that this were the
         case, but it is not. Many men and women who profess the religion
         of Christ are guilty. Even some who profess to be looking for His
         appearing are no more prepared for that event than Satan himself.
         They are not cleansing themselves from all pollution. They have so
3        long served their lust that it is natural for their thoughts to be impure
         and their imaginations corrupt.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
         Church, vol. 2, p. 346.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In class, go over your answers to Tuesday’s question. How do
          we see this principle manifested in today’s society?

          l2 Look at the second quote from Ellen G. White in Friday’s
          study. If you see yourself in there, what is the answer? Why is it
          important not to give up in despair but to keep claiming God’s
          promises—first, of forgiveness; second, of cleansing? Who is the
          one that wants you to say, once and for all, “It’s no use. I’m too
          corrupt. I can never be saved, so I might as well give up”? Do
          you listen to him or to Jesus, who will say to us, “Neither do I
          condemn thee: go, and sin no more”? John 8:11.

          l
          3 Why is it so important for us as Christians to understand
          basic human sinfulness and depravity? What can happen when
          we lose sight of that sad but true reality? Into what errors can a
          false understanding of our true condition lead us?

Jean Claude Comes Around
   When Jean Claude joined a charismatic church in Burundi, a tiny coun-
try in central Africa, church leaders saw his potential and urged him to
become a pastor. Jean Claude studied and was sent to northern Burundi to
pastor. Soon he became the district leader with some 250 churches and 79
pastors under his guidance.
   One day he went to a shop owned by an Adventist man. The shop owner
shared some Bible texts with Jean Claude. Jean Claude wasn’t interested
in Adventist beliefs. He thought Adventists were legalists and poked fun
at them. But the layman didn’t give up. He continued to share Bible truths
with the pastor every chance he had.
   One day when Jean Claude stopped by, the layman challenged him to
explain Matthew 5:17, 18 and James 2:10, which say that Jesus never
did away with the Ten Commandment law. Jean Claude couldn’t explain
them, and the layman introduced him to the Adventist district pastor, who
offered to study the Bible with him. Reluctantly, Jean Claude agreed.
   Jean Claude became convinced that he had been wrong, that God’s laws
had never been abolished. And if the law still stood, then he was teaching
the people under his authority a lie.
   Jean Claude resigned from his church position saying, “I can no longer
teach lies. I’m going to join the Seventh-day Adventist Church.” He sent
copies of the letter to the pastors who served under his leadership.
   His church headquarters sent pastors to talk to him, but Jean Claude
stood firm and read to the pastors the Bible texts that had convicted him.
“We’ve not been observing all the Ten Commandments,” Jean Claude
said. His wife supported his decision, and the couple began worshipping
in the Adventist church with the shopkeeper who had introduced him to
the Adventist faith. But the church was quite far from where he lived.
   Near Jean Claude’s home was a small Adventist congregation with
only 20 members. Jean Claude arranged to hold evangelistic meetings in
the area. He bought a piece of land and invited the larger church’s choir
to come and sing for the meetings. The members helped build a simple
church.
   Several members of Jean Claude’s former church came to the meet-
ings, and some of them have joined the church. Jean Claude continues to
share his faith in the same eager way that was so successful in his former
church.

     Justified by Faith




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 3:19–28.

Memory Text: “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by
     faith without the deeds of the law” (Romans 3:28).




     I
         n this lesson we come to the basic theme of Romans: justification by
         faith. The phrase is a figure based on law. The transgressor of the law
         comes before a judge and is condemned to death for his transgres-
     sions. But a substitute appears and takes the transgressor’s crimes upon
     himself, thus clearing the criminal, who—by accepting the substitute—
     stands before the judge not only cleared of his guilt but regarded as never
     having committed the crimes for which he was first brought into court.
     And that’s because the substitute—who has a perfect record—offers the
     pardoned criminal his own perfect law-keeping. Thus, the guilty one
     stands before the judge as having never transgressed.
        No one is saying that the person was innocent. On the contrary, his guilt
     is presumed. The good news is that, despite the guilt, he is pardoned.
        In the plan of salvation, each of us is the criminal. The substitute,
     Jesus, has a perfect record, and He stands in the court in our stead,
     His righteousness accepted in place of our unrighteousness. Hence,
     we are justified before God, not because of our works but because
     of Jesus, whose righteousness becomes ours when we accept it “by
     faith.” Hence the term “justification by faith.” No matter our past,
     when we accept Jesus we stand before God in His righteousness, the
     only righteousness that can save us.
        Talk about good news! In fact, the news can’t get any better than that.

     The Deeds of the Law
Read Romans 3:19, 20. What is Paul saying here about the law,
     about what it does and what it does not or cannot do? Why is this
     point so important for all Christians to understand?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Paul is using the word law in its broad sense as the Jew in his day
     understood it. By the word Torah (the Hebrew word for “law”), a Jew
     even today thinks particularly of God’s instruction in the first five
     books of Moses but also more generally in the entire Old Testament.
     The moral law, plus the amplification of this in the statutes and judg-
     ments, as well as the ceremonial precepts, was a part of this instruction.
     Because of this, we may think of the law here as the system of Judaism.
        To be under the law means to be under its jurisdiction. The law,
     however, reveals a person’s shortcomings and guilt before God. The
     law cannot remove that guilt; what it can do is lead the sinner to seek
     a remedy for it.
        As we apply the book of Romans in our day, in which Jewish law is
     no longer a factor, we think of law particularly in terms of the moral
     law. This law can’t save us any more than the system of Judaism
     could save the Jews. To save a sinner is not the moral law’s function.
     Its function is to reveal God’s character and to show people wherein
     they fall short of reflecting that character.
        Whatever law it is—moral, ceremonial, civil, or all combined—the
     keeping of any or all in and of itself will not make a person just in God’s
     sight. In fact, the law never was intended to do that. On the contrary, the
     law was to point out our shortcomings and lead us to Christ.
        The law can no more save than can the symptoms of a disease cure
     the disease. The symptoms don’t cure; they point out the need for the
     cure. That’s how the law functions.

      How successful have your efforts in law-keeping been? What
      should that answer tell you about the futility of trying to be
      saved by keeping the law?

     Faith and Righteousness
       “Now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
     being witnessed by the law and the prophets” (Rom. 3:21). How
     are we to understand what this text means?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        This new righteousness is contrasted with the righteousness of the
     law, which was the righteousness with which the Jew was familiar.
     The new righteousness is called “the righteousness of God”; that is,
     a righteousness that comes from God, a righteousness that God pro-
     vides, and the only one that He accepts as true righteousness.
        This is, of course, the righteousness that Jesus wrought out in His
     life while here in human flesh, a righteousness that He offers to all
     who will accept it by faith, who will claim it for themselves, not
     because they deserve it but because they need it.

     “Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law demands righteous-
     ness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but he is incapable of
     rendering it. The only way in which he can attain to righteousness
     is through faith. By faith he can bring to God the merits of Christ,
     and the Lord places the obedience of His Son to the sinner’s account.
     Christ’s righteousness is accepted in place of man’s failure, and God
     receives, pardons, justifies, the repentant, believing soul, treats him
     as though he were righteous, and loves him as He loves His Son.”
     —Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 367. How can you learn
     to accept this wonderful truth for yourself? (See also Rom. 3:22.)

        The faith of Jesus Christ is here, doubtless, faith in Jesus Christ. As
     it operates in the Christian life, faith is much more than intellectual
     assent; it is more than just an acknowledgment of certain facts about
     Christ’s life and His death. Instead, true faith in Jesus Christ is accept-
     ing Him as Savior, Substitute, Surety, and Lord. It is choosing His
     way of life. It is trusting Him and seeking by faith to live according
     to His commandments.

     Grace and Justification
Keeping in mind what we have studied so far about the law and
     what the law cannot do, read Romans 3:24. What is Paul saying
     here? What does it mean that redemption is in Jesus?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        What is this idea of “justifying,” as found in the text? The Greek
     word dikaioo, translated “justify,” may mean “make righteous,”
     “declare righteous,” or “consider righteous.” The word is built on the
     same root as dikaiosune, “righteousness,” and the word dikaioma,
     “righteous requirement.” Hence, there is a close connection between
     “justification” and “righteousness,” a connection that doesn’t always
     come through in various translations. We are justified when we are
     “declared righteous” by God.
        Before this justification, a person is unrighteous, and thus unaccept-
     able to God; after justification, he or she is regarded as righteous, and
     thus acceptable to Him.
        And this happens only through God’s grace. Grace means “favor.” When
     a sinner turns to God for salvation, it is an act of grace to consider or
     declare that person to be righteous. It is unmerited favor, and the believer
     is justified without any merit of his or her own, without any claim to pre-
     sent to God in his or her own behalf except his or her utter helplessness.
     The person is justified through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, the
     redemption that Jesus offers as the sinner’s substitute and surety.
        Justification is presented in Romans as a punctiliar act; that is, it hap-
     pens at a point in time. One moment the sinner is outside, unrighteous,
     and unaccepted; the next moment, following justification, the person is
     inside, righteous, and accepted.
        The person who is in Christ looks upon justification as a past act, one
     that took place when he or she surrendered himself or herself fully to
     Christ. “Being justified” (Rom. 5:1) is, literally, “having been justified.”
        Of course, if the justified sinner should fall away and then return
     to Christ, justification would occur again. Also, if reconversion is
     considered a daily experience, there is a sense in which justification
     might be considered a repeating experience.

      With the good news of salvation being so good, what holds
      people back from accepting it? In your own life, what kinds of
      things cause you to hold back from all that the Lord promises
      and offers you?

     “His Righteousness”
        In Romans 3:25, Paul expounds further on the great news of salva-
     tion. He uses a fancy word, propitiation. The Greek word for it, hilas-
     terion, occurs in the New Testament only here and in Hebrews 9:5,
     where it is translated “mercy-seat.” As used in Romans 3:25, describ-
     ing the offer of justification and redemption through Christ, propitia-
     tion seems to represent the fulfillment of all that was typified by the
     mercy-seat in the Old Testament sanctuary. What this means, then, is
     that by His sacrificial death, Jesus has been set forth as the means of
     salvation and is represented as the One providing the propitiation. In
     short, it means that God did what was needed to save us.
        The text also talks about the “remission of sins.” It is our sins that
     make us unacceptable to God. We can do nothing of ourselves to can-
     cel our sins. But in the plan of redemption, God has provided a way
     for these sins to be remitted through faith in Christ’s blood.
        The word for remission is the Greek paresis, literally “passing
     over” or “passing by.” The “passing over” is in no sense an ignoring
     of sins. God can pass over the sins of the past because, by His death,
     Christ has paid the penalty for all people’s sins. Anyone, therefore,
     who has “faith in His blood” can have his or her sins remitted, for
     Christ has already died for them (1 Cor. 15:3).

Read Romans 3:26, 27. What point is Paul making here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The good news that Paul was eager to share with all who would
     listen was that there was available to humanity “his [that is, God’s]
     righteousness,” and that it comes to us, not by works, not by our merit,
     but by faith in Jesus and what He has done for us.
        Because of the cross of Calvary, God can declare sinners righ-
     teous and still be considered just and fair in the eyes of the universe.
     Satan can point no accusing finger at God, for Heaven has made the
     supreme sacrifice. Satan had accused God of asking of the human race
     more than He was willing to give. The Cross refutes this claim.

      Satan expected God to destroy the world after it sinned;
      instead, He sent Jesus to save it. What does that tell us about the
      character of God? How should our knowledge of His character
      impact how we live? What will you do differently in the next 24
      hours directly as a result of knowing what God is like?

Faith and Works
  “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
the deeds of the law” (Rom. 3:28). Does this mean that we are not
required to obey the law, even if it doesn’t save us? Explain your
answer.

_______________________________________________________

   In the historical context, Paul was speaking in Romans 3:28 of law
in its broad sense of the system of Judaism. No matter how consci-
entiously a Jew tried to live under this system, if he or she failed to
accept Jesus as the Messiah, that person could not be justified.
   This verse is Paul’s conclusion from his claim that the law of faith
excludes boasting. If a man were justified by his own actions, he
could boast about it. But when he is justified because Jesus is the
object of his faith, then the credit clearly belongs to God, who justi-
fied the sinner.
   Ellen G. White gives an interesting answer to the question “What is
justification by faith?” She wrote, “It is the work of God in laying the
glory of man in the dust, and doing for man that which it is not in his
power to do for himself.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies to Ministers
and Gospel Workers, p. 456.
   Works of law cannot atone for past sins. Justification cannot be
earned. It can be received only by faith in the atoning sacrifice of
Christ. Therefore, in this sense, works of law have nothing to do with
justification. To be justified without works means to be justified with-
out there being anything in ourselves to merit justification.
   But many Christians have misunderstood and misapplied this text.
They say that all one has to do is to believe, while downplaying
works or obedience, even obedience to the moral law. In so doing,
they completely misread Paul. In the book of Romans, and elsewhere,
Paul attaches great importance to the keeping of the moral law. Jesus
certainly did, as well, as did James and John (Matt. 19:17; Rom. 2:13;
James 2:10, 11; Rev. 14:12). Paul’s point is that, although obedience
to the law is not the means of justification, the person who is justified
by faith still keeps the law of God and, in fact, is the only one who
can keep the law. An unregenerate person who has not been justified
can never fulfill the requirements of the law.

 Why is it so easy to get caught in the trap of thinking that
 because the law doesn’t save us, we need not worry about keep-
 ing it? Have you ever rationalized away sin by claiming justifi-
 cation by faith? Why is that a very dangerous position? At the
 same time, where would we be without the promise of salvation,
 even when tempted to abuse it?
                                                                     35

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Righteousness of Christ
         in the Law,” pp. 236–239; “Come and Seek and Find,” pp. 331–335;
         “Perfect Obedience Through Christ,” pp. 373, 374, in Selected
         Messages, book 1; “Things New and Old,” pp. 128, 129, in Christ’s
         Object Lessons.

            “Christ’s character stands in place of your character, and you are
         accepted before God just as if you had not sinned.”—Ellen G. White,
         Steps to Christ, p. 62.
            “Grace is unmerited favor. The angels, who know nothing of sin,
         do not understand what it is to have grace exercised toward them; but
1        our sinfulness calls for the exercise of grace from a merciful God.”
         —Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 331, 332.
            “Faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to promise pardon
         to sinners; not that there is any virtue in faith whereby salvation is mer-
         ited, but because faith can lay hold of the merits of Christ, the remedy
         provided for sin. Faith can present Christ’s perfect obedience instead of
2        the sinner’s transgression and defection. When the sinner believes that
         Christ is his personal Savior, then, according to His unfailing promises,
         God pardons his sin, and justifies him freely. The repentant soul real-
         izes that his justification comes because Christ, as his substitute and
         surety, has died for him, is his atonement and righteousness.”—Ellen G.
         White, Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 366, 367.
            “Though the law cannot remit the penalty for sin, but charges the sinner
         with all his debt, Christ has promised abundant pardon to all who repent,
3        and believe in His mercy. The love of God is extended in abundance
         to the repenting, believing soul. The brand of sin upon the soul can be
         effaced only through the blood of the atoning Sacrifice . . . of Him who
         was equal with the Father. The work of Christ—His life, humiliation,
         death, and intercession for lost man—magnifies the law, and makes it
         honorable.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 371.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Read over the texts for this week and then, in your own
          words, write a paragraph summarizing what they are saying.
          Share your paragraphs with each other in class.

          l2 Think about what it cost to save us: the death of the Son of
          God. What should that tell us about just how bad sin is? After
          all, if we stopped sinning and never did it again, why would that
          still not be enough to make us righteous before God? How can
          these facts help motivate us to resist the temptation to sin?

          l
          3 What are ways one could be tempted to abuse this wonderful news
          about salvation by faith alone? What trap is someone falling into who
          gets caught up in that kind of thinking? (See 2 Pet. 3:16, 1 John 3:7.)

  Like most children, Ryan Wigglesworth from Australia looked forward
to his seventh birthday and the party his parents had promised. He would
have a birthday cake and play games with his friends. But Ryan wouldn’t
receive birthday gifts. Instead, it was his family’s tradition that he would ask
his friends to bring a donation of money for a special mission project.
  Ryan’s family was planning a mission trip to the island of Vanuatu
[van-oo-AH-too] in the South Pacific, and Ryan wanted to use his birth-
day money to buy books and literature to give to the people there so they
could learn more about Jesus.
  After his birthday Ryan and his mom went to the Adventist Book
Center to buy the books for their trip. The store was having a big sale, so
Ryan’s money went even farther than he dreamed! “We bought 245 books
and Bible study guides and other literature,” he says.
  Soon the family flew to Vanuatu. They visited a marketplace, where
Ryan’s mother bought fruits and vegetables while Ryan gave the children
some colorful pamphlets about Jesus. Then Ryan met Sope, a man who
worked with prisoners. Ryan gave him some Bible study guides to share
with the prisoners.
  The family held a week of meetings on two different islands. The first
day 49 children came after school. The next day they brought their friends,
and the attendance grew to 100! Even though the meetings were for chil-
dren, some adults came to hear the messages of God’s love. When Ryan
and his brothers and parents gave out literature, they were surprised at
how happy people were to receive it.
  The family said Goodbye to their new friends and took a boat to the
second island. There they held another series of meetings with much the
same results. People were amazed that Ryan and his brothers led out in the
programs, even though they were children themselves.
                                Too soon it was time to say Goodbye. Ryan’s
                              family agreed that this was the best possible
                              vacation—sharing God’s love with people
                              who were eager to learn. “The people were so
                              happy to receive even one piece of literature.
                              That was gift enough for me! I know now that
                              even though I’m just a boy, I can do lots of
                              things for Jesus!”


                               Our mission offerings provide literature and training so
                               that people in South Pacific and around the world can
                               hear God’s message of love.

     Justification and the Law




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 15:6; 2 Samuel 11, 12;
     Rom. 3:20–23, 31; 4:1–17; Gal. 3:19; 1 John 3:4.

Memory Text: “Do we then make void the law through faith?
     God forbid: yea, we establish the law” (Romans 3:31).



     I
          n many ways, Romans 4 gets to the foundation of the biblical doc-
          trine of salvation by faith alone. By using Abraham—the paragon
          of holiness and virtue—as an example of someone who needed to
     be saved by grace, without the deeds of the law, Paul left readers no
     room for misunderstanding. If the best one’s works and law-keeping
     weren’t enough to justify him before God, what hope does anyone
     else have? If it had to be by grace with Abraham, it has to be the same
     with everyone else, Jews and Gentiles.
        In Romans 4, Paul reveals three major stages in the plan of salva-
     tion: (1) the promise of divine blessing (the promise of grace); (2) the
     human response to that promise (the response of faith); and, finally,
     (3) the divine pronouncement of righteousness credited to those who
     believe (justification). That’s how it worked with Abraham, and that’s
     how it works with us.
        It is crucial to remember that for Paul, salvation is by grace; it’s some-
     thing that is given to us, however undeserving we are. If we deserved it,
     then we’d be owed it, and if we’re owed it, it’s a debt and not a gift. And
     for beings corrupt and fallen as we are, salvation has to be a gift.
        To prove his point about salvation by faith alone, Paul goes all the
     way to the book of Genesis, quoting Genesis 15:6—“Abram believed
     the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness” (NIV).

     The Law Established
       				
Read Romans 3:31. What’s Paul’s point here? Why is this point
     important to us as Seventh-day Adventists?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       In this passage, Paul states emphatically that faith does not make
     void God’s law. Even those who kept the law, even the entire Old
     Testament corpus of law, were never saved by it. The religion of the
     Old Testament, as that of the New, was always one of God’s grace
     given to sinners by faith.

Read Romans 4:1–8. How does this show that even in the Old
     Testament, salvation was by faith and not by works of the law?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        According to this Old Testament narrative, Abraham was accounted
     righteous because he “believed God.” Therefore, the Old Testament
     itself teaches righteousness by faith. Hence, any implication that faith
     “makes void” (Greek katargeo, “renders useless,” “invalidates”) the
     law is false; salvation by faith is very much part of the Old Testament.
     Grace is taught all the way through it. What, for instance, was the entire
     sanctuary ritual if not a representation of how sinners are saved, not by
     their own works but by the death of a substitute in their stead?
        Also, what else can explain how David was forgiven after the sor-
     did affair with Bathsheba? Certainly it wasn’t law-keeping that saved
     him, for he violated so many principles of the law that it condemned
     him on numerous counts. If David were to be saved by the law, then
     David would not be saved at all.
        Paul sets forth David’s restoration to divine favor as an example of
     justification by faith. Forgiveness was an act of God’s grace. Here,
     then, is another example from the Old Testament of righteousness
     by faith. In fact, however legalistic many in ancient Israel became,
     the Jewish religion was always a religion of grace. Legalism was a
     perversion of it, not its foundation.

      Dwell for a few minutes on David’s sin and restoration (2 Samuel
      11, 12, Psalm 51). What hope can you draw from that sad story
      for yourself? Is there a lesson here in how we in the church
      should treat those who have fallen?
                                                                           39
                 M onday July 26

      Grace or Debt?
      The issue Paul is dealing with here is much more than just theology.
   It gets to the heart and soul of salvation and of our relationship to God.
   If one believes that he or she must earn acceptance, that he or she
   must reach a certain standard of holiness before being justified and
   forgiven, then how natural to turn inward and to look to oneself and
   one’s deeds. Religion can become exceedingly self-centered, about
   the last thing anyone needs.
      In contrast, if one grasps the great news that justification is a gift
   from God, totally unmerited and undeserved, how much easier and
   more natural is it for that person to turn his or her focus on God’s love
   and mercy instead of on self?
      And in the end, who’s more likely to reflect the love and character
   of God—the one self-absorbed or the one God-absorbed?
      			
Read Romans 4:6–8. How does Paul here expand on the theme of
   justification by faith?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         “The sinner must come in faith to Christ, take hold of His merits,
      lay his sins upon the Sin Bearer, and receive His pardon. It was for
      this cause that Christ came into the world. Thus the righteousness of
      Christ is imputed to the repenting, believing sinner. He becomes a
      member of the royal family.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages,
      book 1, p. 215.
         Paul then continues, explaining that salvation by faith was not only for
      the Jews but for the Gentiles, as well (Rom. 4:9–12). In fact, if you want
      to get technical about it, Abraham wasn’t Jewish; he came from a pagan
      ancestry (Josh. 24:2). The Gentile-Jewish distinction didn’t exist in his
      time. When Abraham was justified (Gen. 15:6), he was not even circum-
      cised. Thus, Abraham became the father of both the uncircumcised and
      the circumcised, as well as a great example for Paul to use in order to
      make his point about the universality of salvation. Christ’s death was for
      everyone, regardless of race or nationality (Heb. 2:9).

       Considering the universality of the Cross, considering what
       the Cross tells us about the worth of every human being, why
       is racial or ethnic or national prejudice such a horrible thing?
       How can we learn to recognize the existence of prejudice in our-
       selves and through God’s grace purge it from our minds?

     Promise and Law
        “For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
     not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the
     righteousness of faith” (Rom. 4:13).
         		
        In this verse, “promise” and “law” are contrasted. Paul is seeking to
     establish an Old Testament base for his teaching of righteousness by
     faith. He finds an example in Abraham, whom all the Jews accepted
     as their ancestor. Acceptance or justification had come to Abraham
     quite apart from the law. God made a promise to Abraham that he
     was to be “heir of the world.” Abraham believed this promise; that
     is, he accepted the role that it implied. As a result God accepted him
     and worked through him to save the world. This remains a powerful
     example of how grace was operating in the Old Testament, which is
     no doubt why Paul used it.

Read Romans 4:14–17. How does Paul here continue showing how
     salvation by faith was central to the Old Testament? See also Gal.
     3:7–9.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       It’s important to remember, as we said in the beginning, to whom
     Paul is writing. These Jewish believers were immersed in Old
     Testament law, and many came to believe that their salvation rested
     on how well they kept the law, even though that was not what the Old
     Testament taught.
       In seeking to remedy this misconception, Paul argued that Abraham,
     even prior to the law at Sinai, received the promises, not by works of
     the law (which would have been hard, since the law—the whole
     Torah and ceremonial system—was not in place yet) but by faith.
       If Paul here were referring to the moral law exclusively, which
     existed in principle even before Sinai, the point remains the same.
     Perhaps even more so! Seeking to receive God’s promises through the
     law, he said, makes faith void, even useless. Those are strong words,
     but his point is that faith saves, and the law condemns. He’s trying
     to teach about the futility of seeking salvation by the very thing that
     leads to condemnation, because we all, Jew and Gentile, have violated
     the law, and, hence, we all need the same thing as Abraham did: the
     saving righteousness of Jesus credited to us by faith.
                                                                         41
         W ednesday July 28

     Law and Faith
        As we saw yesterday, Paul showed that God’s dealings with
     Abraham proved that salvation came through the promise of grace
     and not through law. Therefore, if the Jews wished to be saved, they
     would have to abandon trust in their works for salvation and accept
     the Abrahamic promise, now fulfilled in the coming of the Messiah.
     It’s the same, really, for everyone, Jew or Gentile, who thinks that
     their “good” deeds are all that it takes to make them right with God.

       “The principle that man can save himself by his own works lay
     at the foundation of every heathen religion. . . . Wherever it is held,
     men have no barrier against sin.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
     Ages, pp. 35, 36. What does this mean? Why does the idea that we
     can save ourselves through our works leave us so open to sin?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

How did Paul explain the relationship between law and faith in
     Galatians? Gal. 3:21–23.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        If there had been a law that could impart life, it certainly would
     have been God’s law. And yet, Paul says that no law, not even God’s,
     can give life, because all have violated that law, and so all are con-
     demned by it.
        But the promise of faith, more fully revealed through Christ, frees
     all who believe from being “under the law”; that is, from being con-
     demned and burdened by trying to earn salvation through it. The law
     becomes a burden when it’s presented without faith, without grace—
     because without faith, without grace, without the righteousness that
     comes by faith, being under the law means being under the burden
     and the condemnation of sin.

      How central is righteousness by faith to your walk with God?
      That is, what can you do to make sure it doesn’t get blurred by
      other aspects of truth to the point where you lose sight of this
      crucial teaching? After all, what good are these other teachings
      without this one?

      The Law and Sin
        				
        We often hear folk say that in the New Covenant the law has been
      abolished and then they proceed to quote texts that they believe prove
      that point. The logic behind that statement, however, isn’t quite sound,
      nor is the theology.

Read 1 John 2:3–6, 3:4, and Romans 3:20. What do these texts tell us
      about the relationship between law and sin?


         A few hundred years ago, Irish writer Jonathan Swift wrote, “But
      will any man say that if the words drinking, cheating, lying, steal-
      ing were by Act of Parliament ejected out of the English tongue and
      dictionaries, we should all awake next morning temperate, honest and
      just, and lovers of truth? Is this a fair consequence?”—Jonathan Swift,
      A Modest Proposal and Other Satires (New York: Prometheus Books,
      1995), p. 205.
         In the same way, if God’s law has been abolished, then why are
      lying, murder, and stealing still sinful or wrong? If God’s law has
      been changed, the definition of sin must be changed, too. Or if God’s
      law was done away with, sin must be, as well, and who believes that?
      (See also 1 John 1:7–10; James 1:14, 15.)
         In the New Testament, both the law and the gospel appear. The law
      shows what sin is; the gospel points to the remedy for that sin, which
      is the death and resurrection of Jesus. If there is no law, there is no
      sin, and so what are we saved from? Only in the context of the law,
      and its continued validity, does the gospel make sense.
         We often hear that the Cross nullified the law. That’s rather ironic,
      because the Cross shows that the law can’t be abrogated or changed. If
      God didn’t abrogate or even change the law before Christ died on the
      cross, why do it after? Why not get rid of the law after humanity sinned
      and thus spare humanity the legal punishment that violation of the law
      brings? That way, Jesus never would have had to die. Jesus’ death shows
      that if the law could have been changed or abrogated, that should have
      been done before, not after, the Cross. Thus, nothing shows the contin-
      ued validity of the law more than does the death of Jesus, a death that
      occurred precisely because the law couldn’t be changed. If the law could
      have been changed to meet us in our fallen condition, wouldn’t that have
      been a better solution to the problem of sin than Jesus having to die?

       If there were no divine law against adultery, would the act
       cause any less pain and hurt than it does now to those who are
       victims of it? How does your answer help you understand why
       God’s law is still in effect? What has been your own experience
       with the consequences of violating God’s law?
                                                                           43

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Christ the Center of the Mes-
         sage,” p. 388, in Selected Messages, book 1; “The Call of Abraham,”
         pp. 125–127; “The Law and the Covenants,” pp. 363, 364, in Patriarchs
         and Prophets; “The Sermon on the Mount,” pp. 307, 308; “Controversy,”
         p. 608; “ ‘It Is Finished,’ ” pp. 762, 763, in The Desire of Ages.

            “In that age of caste, when the rights of men were often unrecog-
1
         nized, Paul set forth the great truth of human brotherhood, declaring
         that God ‘hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
         all the face of the earth.’ In the sight of God all are on an equality.”
         —Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 238.
            “In order for man to be saved, and for the honor of the law to be main-
         tained, it was necessary for the Son of God to offer Himself as a sacrifice
2
         for sin. He who knew no sin became sin for us. He died for us on Calvary.
         His death shows the wonderful love of God for man, and the immutability
         of His law.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 240.
            “Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law demands righ-
         teousness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but he is incapable of
         rendering it. The only way in which he can attain to righteousness is
         through faith. By faith he can bring to God the merits of Christ, and
         the Lord places the obedience of His Son to the sinner’s account.”
3
         —Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 367.
            “If Satan can succeed in leading man to place value upon his own
         works as works of merit and righteousness, he knows that he can
         overcome him by his temptations, and make him his victim and prey.
         . . . Strike the door-posts with the blood of Calvary’s Lamb, and you
         are safe.”—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Sept. 3, 1889.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Why is it important to understand salvation by faith alone
          without the deeds of law? What errors can that knowledge pro-
          tect us from? What dangers await those who lose sight of this?

          l2 What other reasons can you give for the continued validity of
          God’s law, even when we understand that the law and obedience
          to it are not what save us?

          l
          3 Dwell more on this idea that because of the Cross all human
          beings are equal. Why is it that so often Christians, who have the
          Cross before them, seem to forget this important truth and can
          be guilty of racial or ethnic or even national prejudice?

          l
          4 As justified sinners, we have been made the recipients of grace
          and undeserved favor from God, whom we have sinned against.
          How should this fact impact how we deal with others? How full
          of grace and favor are we toward those who have wronged us?

Loving the Truth
by Lysa Salinas
   My name is Lysa, and I live in the Philippines. But while I still lived in
Malaysia, a friend gave me a Bible and invited me to her church. I went
and found a group of loving people who drew me to God. I read the Bible
and joined a small-group Bible study. I surrendered my life to Christ and
joined that church. I felt fulfilled and blessed.
   Then my father died, and my mother felt all alone. She called me back
to the Philippines to live with her and help care for my disabled sister.
I returned to the Philippines and began attending a church of the same
denomination as the one I had left in Malaysia. But it wasn’t the same. I
missed the close fellowship of loving friends who had been closer than
family to me.
   Then one day a man came to our home selling books. I wasn’t interested
in what he had to say, but my mother invited him in and they talked for
a long time. Finally I began listening to them. I asked what church he
belonged to, and he told me he was a Seventh-day Adventist. I hadn’t
heard of Adventists before, and I asked him many questions.
   He couldn’t answer all my questions that day, but he promised to return.
The next day the man came back with his Bible. Again I began asking
questions, and he answered each one from the Bible.
   He invited me to evangelistic meetings that were being held in a church
not far from our home. I went because I was thirsty for God’s Word. I
attended the meetings, but the Sabbath was too strange for me to accept.
I wondered why these Adventists worship on Saturday when other
Christians worship on Sunday. But I was determined to study the issue
for myself. If the Sabbath was true, I needed to know so I could tell my
spiritual brothers and sisters in Malaysia.
   I asked God to show me the truth in this Sabbath issue. I visited the
library of a religious university in town searching for a book on the history
of Christianity. I prayed again and opened my eyes. There was the book
I was looking for. I checked it out and started reading it. Sure enough, it
said that the Bible Sabbath was Saturday; men had changed the day of
worship to Sunday.
   I began attending the Adventist church, and in time my daughter and
I were baptized. I pray for my family and for my Christian friends in
Malaysia who don’t yet know this wonderful truth.
   Thank you for sharing your mission offerings so that people such as I
can learn to love God’s truth.

     Expounding the Faith




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 5.
Memory Text: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace
     with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have
     access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in
     hope of the glory of God” (Romans 5:1, 2).



     P
            aul has established the point that justification, or acceptance with
            God, comes only through faith in Jesus Christ, for His righteous-
            ness alone is enough to give us the right standing with our Lord.
     Building on that great truth, Paul now expounds more on this theme.
     Showing that salvation has to be by faith and not by works, not even for
     someone as “righteous” as Abraham, Paul in a sense steps back and looks
     at the big picture—at what caused sin and suffering and death and how
     the solution is found in Christ and what He’s done for the human race.
        Through the fall of one man, Adam, all humanity faced condemna-
     tion, alienation, and death; through the victory of one man, Jesus, all
     the world was placed on a new footing before God, one in which, by
     faith in Jesus, the record of their sins and the punishment due those
     sins could be remitted, could be forgiven and forever pardoned.
        Paul contrasts Adam and Jesus, showing how Christ came to undo
     what Adam did and that by faith the victims of Adam’s sin could be
     rescued by Jesus, the Savior. The foundation of it all is the cross of
     Christ and His substitutionary death there—which opens the way for
     every human being, Jew or Gentile, to be saved by Jesus, who with
     His blood brought justification to all who accept Him.
        Surely this is a theme worth expounding upon, for it’s the founda-
     tion of all our hope.

     Therefore, Being Justified
Read Romans 5:1–5. On the lines below summarize Paul’s message.
     What can you take from that for yourself now?
       				
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        “Being justified” is literally “having been justified.” The Greek verb
     represents the action as completed. We have been declared righteous,
     or regarded as righteous, not through any deeds of law but through our
     having accepted Jesus Christ. The perfect life that Jesus lived on this
     earth, His perfect law-keeping, has been credited to us.
        At the same time, all of our sins have been laid on Jesus. God has
     reckoned that Jesus committed those sins, not us, and that way we
     can be spared the punishment that we deserve. That punishment fell
     on Christ for us, in behalf of us, so that we never have to face it our-
     selves. What more glorious news could there be for the sinner?
        The Greek word translated “glory” in verse 3 is the one translated
     “rejoice” in verse 2. If it is translated “rejoice” in verse 3 also (as in
     some versions), the connection between verses 2 and 3 is more clearly
     seen. Justified people can rejoice in tribulation because they have
     fixed their faith and trust in Jesus Christ. They have confidence that
     God will work all things for good. They will consider it an honor to
     suffer for Christ’s sake. (See 1 Pet. 4:13.)
        Notice, too, the progression in verses 3 through 5.
        1. Patience. The Greek word hupomone means “steadfast endur-
     ance.” This is the type of endurance that tribulation develops in the
     one who maintains faith and who does not lose sight of the hope he
     or she has in Christ even amid the trials and suffering that can make
     life so miserable at times.
        2. Experience. The Greek word dokime means literally “the qual-
     ity of being approved,” hence, “character,” or more specifically,
     “approved character.” The one who patiently endures trials can
     develop an approved character.
        3. Hope. Endurance and approval naturally give rise to hope, the
     hope found in Jesus and the promise of salvation in Him. As long as
     we cling to Jesus in faith, repentance, and obedience, we have every-
     thing to hope for.

      What is the one thing in all your life that you hope for more than
      anything else? How can that hope be fulfilled in Jesus? Or can it?
      If not, are you sure you want to be putting so much hope in it?

     God Seeking Humanity
Read Romans 5:6–8. What do these verses tell us about the character
     of God, and why are they so full of hope for us?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        When Adam and Eve shamefully and inexcusably transgressed the
     divine requirement, God took the first steps toward reconciliation.
     Ever since, God has taken the initiative in providing a way of salva-
     tion and in inviting men and women to accept it. “When the fulness of
     the time was come, God sent forth his Son” (Gal. 4:4).

Romans 5:9 says that we can be saved from God’s wrath through
     Jesus. How do we understand what that means?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        As the blood on the doorposts of the Israelites in Egypt on the eve
     of their departure protected the firstborn from the wrath that befell
     Egypt’s firstborn, so the blood of Jesus Christ guarantees that one
     who has been justified and retains that status will be protected when
     God’s wrath finally destroys sin at the end of the age.
        Some folk struggle with the idea of a loving God having wrath. But
     it’s precisely because of His love that this wrath exists. How could
     God, who loves the world, not have wrath against sin? Were He indif-
     ferent to us, He would not care about what happens here. Look around
     at the world and see what sin has done to His creation. How could
     God not be wrathful against such evil and devastation?

What other reasons are we given to rejoice? (Rom. 5:10, 11).

        		
        Some commentators have seen in verse 10 a reference to the life
     that Christ lived on this earth, during which He wrought a perfect
     character that He now offers to credit to us. Though this is certainly
     what Christ’s perfect life accomplished, Paul seems to be empha-
     sizing the fact that whereas Christ died, He rose again and is alive
     forevermore (see Heb. 7:25). Because He lives, we are saved. If He
     had remained in the tomb, our hopes would have perished with Him.
     Verse 11 continues with the reasons that we have to rejoice in the
     Lord, and that’s because of what Jesus has accomplished for us.

     Death Swallowed Up
       Death is an enemy, the ultimate one. When God created the human
     family, He designed that its members should live forever. With few
     exceptions humans do not want to die, and those who do, do so only
     after the greatest personal anguish and suffering. Death goes against
     our most basic nature. And that’s because, from inception, we were
     created to live forever. Death was to be unknown to us.

Read Romans 5:12. What is Paul describing here? What does this
     explain?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Commentators have argued more over this passage of Scripture
     than over most others. Perhaps the reason is, as noted in The SDA
     Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 529, that these commentators “attempt
     to use the passage for purposes other than Paul intended.”
        One point they argue over is, in what way was Adam’s sin passed
     on to his posterity? Did Adam’s descendants share the guilt of
     Adam’s sin, or are they guilty before God because of their own sin?
     Though folk have tried to get the answer to that question from this
     text, that’s not the issue Paul was dealing with. He had a whole other
     object in mind. He is reemphasizing what he already stated, “for all
     have sinned” (Rom. 3:23). We need to recognize that we are sinners,
     because only that way will we realize our need of a Savior. Paul
     here was trying to get readers to realize just how bad sin is and what
     it brought into this world through Adam. Then he shows what God
     offers us in Jesus as the only remedy to the tragedy brought upon our
     world through Adam’s sin.
        Yet, this text tells only of the problem, death in Adam—not the
     solution, life in Christ. One of the most glorious aspects of the gospel
     is that death has been swallowed up in life. Jesus passed through the
     portals of the tomb and burst its bonds. He says, “I am he that liveth,
     and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have
     the keys of hell and of death” (Rev. 1:18). Because Jesus has the keys,
     the enemy can no longer hold his victims in the grave.

      What has been your own experience with the reality and the
      tragedy of death? Why, in the face of such a relentless enemy,
      must we have a hope in something greater than ourselves or
      greater than anything this world offers?

      Law Awakens Need
        “Until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when
      there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses,
      even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s
      transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come” (Rom.
      5:13, 14).

         What is Paul talking about here? The phrase “until the law” is paral-
      leled with the statement “from Adam to Moses.” He is talking about
      the time in the world from creation to Sinai, before the formal intro-
      duction of the rules and laws of the Israelite system, which included,
      of course, the Ten Commandments.
         “Until the law” means until the detailing of God’s requirements in
      the various laws given to Israel at Sinai. Sin existed before Sinai. How
      could it not? Were lying, killing, adultery, and idolatry not sinful until
      then? Of course they were.

What are some texts that reveal the reality of sin before Sinai?


         It is true that prior to Sinai the human race generally had only a limited
      revelation of God, but they obviously knew enough to be held account-
      able. God is just and isn’t going to punish anyone unfairly. People in
      the pre-Sinai world died, as Paul here points out. Death passed upon all.
      Though they had not sinned against an expressly revealed command,
      they had sinned nevertheless. They had the revelations of God in nature,
      to which they had not responded and thus were held guilty. “The invis-
      ible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen . . . ; so
      that they are without excuse” (Rom. 1:20).

For what purpose did God reveal Himself more fully in the “law”?
      Rom. 5:20, 21.


         The instruction given at Sinai included the moral law, though it had
      existed before then. This was the first time, however, according to the
      Bible, that this law was written and widely proclaimed.
         When the Israelites began to compare themselves with the divine
      requirements, they discovered that they fell far short. In other words,
      “the offense” abounded. They suddenly realized the extent of their
      transgressions. The purpose of such a revelation was to help them
      to see their need of a Savior and to drive them to accept the grace so
      freely offered by God. As stressed before, the true version of the Old
      Testament faith was not legalistic.

     The Second Adam
       “Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all
     men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the
     free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one
     man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience
     of one shall many be made righteous” (Rom. 5:18, 19). What con-
     trast is presented here to us? What hope is offered us in Christ?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        As humans, we received nothing from Adam but the sentence of
     death. Christ, however, stepped in and passed over the ground where
     Adam fell, enduring every test in humanity’s behalf. He redeemed Adam’s
     disgraceful failure and fall, and, thus, as our Substitute, He placed us on
     vantage ground with God. Hence, Jesus is the “Second Adam.”
        “The second Adam was a free moral agent, held responsible for his
     conduct. Surrounded by intensely subtle and misleading influences,
     He was much less favorably situated than was the first Adam to lead
     a sinless life. Yet in the midst of sinners He resisted every temptation
     to sin, and maintained His innocency. He was ever sinless.”—Ellen G.
     White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1074.

How are Adam’s and Christ’s acts contrasted in Romans 5:15–19?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Look at the opposing ideas here: death, life; disobedience, obedi-
     ence; condemnation, justification; sin, righteousness. Jesus came and
     undid all that Adam had done!
       It is fascinating, too, that the word gift occurs five times in verses 15
     through 17. Five times! The point is simple: Paul is emphasizing that
     justification is not earned; it comes as a gift. It is something that we
     don’t merit, that we don’t deserve. Like all gifts, we have to reach out
     and accept them, and in this case, with this gift, we claim it by faith.

      What was the best gift you ever were given? What made it so
      good, so special? How did the fact that it was a gift, as opposed
      to something you earned, make you that much more apprecia-
      tive of it? Yet, how could that gift even begin to compare with
      what we have in Jesus?

            “Many are deceived concerning the condition of their hearts. They
         do not realize that the natural heart is deceitful above all things, and
         desperately wicked. They wrap themselves about with their own righ-
         teousness, and are satisfied in reaching their own human standard of
         character.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 320.
2           “There is great need that Christ should be preached as the only hope
         and salvation. When the doctrine of justification by faith was pre-
         sented . . . , it came to many as water comes to the thirsty traveler. The
         thought that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, not because
         of any merit on our part, but as a free gift from God, seemed a pre-
         cious thought.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 360.
            “Trial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to purify
         God’s children from the dross of earthliness. It is because God is leading
3
         His children that trying experiences come to them. Trials and obstacles
         are His chosen methods of discipline, and His appointed conditions of
         success. He who reads the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better
         than they themselves can know them. He sees that some have qualifica-
         tions which, if rightly directed, could be used in the advancement of His
         work.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 524.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 How has your faith sustained you through some terrible tri-
          als? What things did you learn from these trials about yourself
          and about God? Also, what have you learned that might be of
          assistance to others who might be going through some hard
          times themselves?

          l2 Think about the reality of death, of what it does not only to life but
          to the meaning of life. Many writers and philosophers have lamented
          the ultimate meaninglessness of life because it ends in eternal death.
          How do we as Christians respond to them? Why is the hope we have
          in Jesus the only answer to that meaninglessness?

          l
          3 Just as Adam’s fall imposed a fallen nature on all of us,
          Jesus’ victory offers the promise of eternal life to all of us who
          accept it by faith, no exceptions. With such a wonderful provi-
          sion right there for us, what holds people back from reaching out
          and eagerly claiming it for themselves? How can each of us help
          those who are seeking to better understand what Christ offers
          and what He has done for them?

Conquered by Love
by Basil Byvalts
   I grew up in Siberia, Russia, during a time when talk of God and reli-
gion was forbidden. Although I hadn’t thought much about whether God
existed, in the depths of my soul I sensed that He must exist. Then one day
I heard His voice and I knew.
   One evening as I walked from my work to my home, suddenly I felt an
overwhelming sense of love fill my body. It was so clear that it almost
stopped me in my tracks. I wasn’t married at the time and had no special
girlfriend. Who are you? I wondered. This wonderful feeling had to be
from a girl, I reasoned. But I couldn’t think of any girl who could give me
the kind of love I was feeling. It was more like a yearning.
   The love was so strong that I wanted to be with this person forever.
Whoever you are, I thought, I will find you and I will love you forever. But
who are you? I asked myself.
   And then I heard the answer, not as a voice, but as a clear understanding
in my mind. It is I, God.
   No! I thought. I thought of God as a judge, an enforcer of laws. Then
fearful that I might insult this God, I said in my heart, I don’t deserve
Your love.
   And God answered, I know you; I know everything about you. And I
love you.
   Don’t love me so much, I argued in my mind. Love me just one day a
week—or less.
   But God’s voice answered, I love you every moment; I will always love
you because I am God.
   I couldn’t help myself. I was conquered by God’s love. That night on
the street in Siberia, with tears rolling down my cheeks, I gave myself to
God. Here I am, God, I prayed. I am Yours. Once more that wonderful
warmth swept through my body. I am in love—with God! I thought.
   The next day a friend invited me to attend some evangelistic meetings. I
went, and there I learned about the God who swept me away by His love.
Later, I learned that on the evening God spoke to me, the evangelist and
other Christians in that city were praying that the Holy Spirit would touch
the hearts of the people in my town. I was an answer to their prayers, one
of almost 200 who found God at those meetings.
   Our mission offerings help send word of God’s incredible love to those
who still don’t know Him. Thank you for sharing.

     Victory Over Sin




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 6, 1 John 1:8–2:1.
Memory Text: “Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are
      not under the law, but under grace” (Romans 6:14).



     H
              aving just expounded on justification by faith, apart from the
              deeds of the law, Paul then proceeds to answer the obvious
              question: if works can’t save us, why bother with them at all?
     Why not just keep on sinning?
        Chapter 6 is his answer to this important question. Paul here is deal-
     ing with what commonly is understood as “sanctification,” the process
     by which we overcome sin and more and more reflect the character of
     Christ. Yet, the word sanctification itself appears nowhere in Romans.
     (The word sanctified occurs once, in Romans 15:16.)
        Does this mean that Paul has nothing to say about what commonly
     is understood by sanctification? Not at all. He simply does not refer
     to it by that term.
        In the Bible “to sanctify” means “to dedicate,” usually to God.
     Thus, to be sanctified is often presented as a past completed act. For
     example, “all them which are sanctified” (Acts 20:32). The sanctified
     ones in this definition are the ones who are dedicated to God.
        But this biblical usage of “sanctify” in no way denies the important
     doctrine of sanctification or the fact that sanctification is the work of
     a lifetime. The Bible strongly endorses this doctrine, but it generally
     uses other terms to describe it.
        This week we’ll look at another side of salvation by faith, one that
     easily can be misunderstood: the promises of victory over sin in the
     life of one saved by Jesus.

     Grace Abounding
        In Romans 5:20, Paul makes a powerful statement: “But where sin
     abounded, grace did much more abound.” His point was that no matter
     how much sin there is or how terrible the results of sin are, God’s grace
     is sufficient to deal with it. What hope that should bring for each of us,
     especially when tempted to feel that our sins are too great to be forgiven!
     In the next verse, Paul shows that though sin has led to death, God’s grace
     through Jesus has defeated death and can give us eternal life.

Read Romans 6:1. What logic is Paul dealing with here, and how, in
     the verses that follow, does he respond to that kind of thinking?
     Rom. 6:2–11.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Paul follows an interesting line of argument in chapter 6 as to why a
     justified person should not sin. To begin with, he says that we shouldn’t
     sin, because we have died to sin. Then he explains what he means.
        Immersion in the waters of baptism represents burial. What is bur-
     ied? The “old man” of sin—that is, the body committing sin, the body
     dominated or ruled by sin. As a result, this “body of sin” is destroyed,
     so that we no longer serve sin. In Romans 6 sin is personified as a
     master who rules over his servants. Once the “body of sin” that served
     sin is destroyed, sin’s mastery over it ceases. The one who rises from
     the watery grave comes up a new person who no longer serves sin. He
     or she now walks in newness of life.
        Christ, having died, died once and for all, but He is now alive
     forevermore. Death can no more rule Him. So, the Christian who is
     baptized has died to sin once and for all and should never again come
     under its dominion.
        Of course, as any baptized Christian knows, sin doesn’t just auto-
     matically disappear from our lives once we come up out of the water.
     Not being ruled by sin isn’t the same as not having to struggle with
     it. We have a daily, moment-by-moment battle to keep reckoning
     ourselves dead to sin and alive unto Christ. Though the promises of
     victory are there, we must claim them—by faith. We always must
     remember, too, that God’s grace abounds, even when we sin. If not,
     what hope would any of us have, even after being baptized?

      What has been your experience with the power of sin in your
      life, even after baptism? What choices are you making that
      allow sin the power over you that it shouldn’t have, despite all
      the promises we have in the Bible for victory over it?
                                                                            57

     Sin Personified
What admonition is given to us in Romans 6:12?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The word reign shows that “sin” is here represented as a king. The
     Greek word here translated “reign” means, literally, “to be a king” or
     “to function as a king.” Sin is all too willing to assume the kingship
     of our mortal bodies and dictate our behavior.
        When Paul says “let not sin . . . reign,” he implies that the justified
     person can choose to prevent sin’s setting itself up as king in his or
     her life. This is where the action of the will comes in.
        “What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This
     is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision,
     or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will. The
     power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to exercise. You
     cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself give to God its
     affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can give Him your
     will; He will then work in you to will and to do according to His good
     pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be brought under the control of
     the Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your
     thoughts will be in harmony with Him.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to
     Christ, p. 47.
        The Greek word in Romans 6:12 translated “lusts” means “desires.”
     These desires may be either for good things or for bad; when sin
     reigns, it will make us desire the bad. The desires will be strong,
     even irresistible if we fight against them on our own. Sin can be a
     cruel tyrant, one who never is satisfied but who always comes back
     for more. Only through faith, only through claiming the promises of
     victory, can we overthrow this unrelenting master.
        The word therefore in this verse is important. It goes back to what
     has been said before, specifically to what has been said in verses 10
     and 11. The baptized person is now living “unto God.” That is, God
     is the center of his or her new life. The person is serving God, doing
     what pleases God and, therefore, cannot serve sin at the same time.
     He or she is “alive unto God through Jesus Christ.”

      Go back over the quote from Ellen G. White in today’s study.
      Notice how crucial the concept of free will is. As moral creatures,
      we must have a free will, the power to choose right and wrong,
      good and evil, Christ or the world. Over the next 24 hours, try to
      keep track consciously of how you are using this moral free will.
      What can you learn about your use, or abuse, of this sacred gift?

     Under the Law?
Read Romans 6:14. How are we to understand this text? Does it
     mean that the Ten Commandments are no longer binding on us?
     If not, why not?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Romans 6:14 is one of the key statements in the book of Romans.
     And it’s one we often hear, usually quoted in the context of someone
     telling us Adventists that the Seventh-day Sabbath has been abro-
     gated.
        Yet, that’s obviously not what the text means. As we asked before,
     how could the moral law be done away with and sin still be a real-
     ity, because the moral law is what defines sin? If you were to read
     all that came before in Romans, even in just chapter 6, it would be
     hard to see how, in the midst of all this discussion about the reality
     of sin, Paul were to suddenly say, “Besides, the moral law, the Ten
     Commandments, which defines sin, has been abolished.” That makes
     no sense.
         Paul is saying to the Romans that the person living “under the
     law”—that is, under the Jewish economy as it was practiced in his
     day, with all its man-made rules and regulations—will be ruled by
     sin. In contrast, a person living under grace will have victory over
     sin, because the law is written in his or her heart and God’s spirit
     is allowed to guide his or her steps. Accepting Jesus Christ as the
     Messiah, being justified by Him, being baptized into His death, hav-
     ing the “old man” destroyed, rising to walk in newness of life—these
     are the things that will dethrone sin from our lives. Remember, that
     is the whole context in which this verse appears, the context of the
     promise of victory over sin.
        We should not define “under the law” too restrictively. The person
     who supposedly lives “under grace” but disobeys God’s law will not
     find grace but condemnation. “Under grace” means that through the
     grace of God as revealed in Jesus, the condemnation that the law
     inevitably brings to sinners has been removed. Thus, now free from
     this condemnation of death brought by the law, we live in “newness
     of life,” a life characterized and made manifest through the fact that,
     being dead to self, we are no longer slaves to sin.

      How have you experienced the reality of a new life in Christ?
      What tangible evidence can you point to that reveals what
      Christ has done in you? What areas are you refusing to let go
      of, and why must you let them go?
                                                                        59

     Two Contending Masters
Read Romans 6:16. What point is Paul making? Why is his argu-
     ment very black and white here? That is, it is either one or the
     other, with no middle ground. What lesson should we draw from
     this very clear contrast?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Paul comes back to the point again that the new life of faith does not
     grant liberty to sin. The life of faith makes possible victory over sin; in
     fact, only through faith can we have the victory that is promised us.
       Having personified sin as a king ruling over his subjects, Paul now
     returns to the figure of sin as a master demanding obedience of his
     servants. Paul points out that a person has a choice of masters. He can
     serve sin, which leads to death, or he can serve righteousness, which
     leads to eternal life. Paul doesn’t leave us any middle ground here or
     any room for compromise. It’s one or the other because, in the end,
     we face either eternal life or eternal death.

Read Romans 6:17. How does Paul expand here on what he said in
     verse 16?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Notice how, interestingly enough, obedience is linked to correct doc-
     trine. The Greek word for “doctrine” here means “teaching.” The Roman
     Christians had been taught the principles of the Christian faith, which
     they now obeyed. Thus, for Paul, correct doctrine, correct teaching,
     when obeyed “from the heart,” led to the Romans becoming “servants of
     righteousness” (vs. 18). We sometimes hear that doctrine does not mat-
     ter, just as long as we show love. That’s a very simplistic expression of
     something that’s not so simple. As stated in an earlier lesson, Paul was
     very concerned about the false doctrine to which the Galatian church had
     succumbed. Thus, we need to be careful about statements that somehow
     denigrate the importance of correct teaching.

      Servants of sin, servants of righteousness: the contrast is very
      stark. If, after baptism, we sin, does this mean that we are not
      truly saved? Read 1 John 1:8–2:1. How do these texts help us
      understand what it means to be a follower of Christ and yet still
      subject to falling?

     Fruit Unto Holiness
Keeping in mind what we have studied so far in Romans 6, read
     the rest of the verses (19–23). Summarize on the lines below the
     gist of what Paul is saying. Most important, ask yourself how you
     can make real in your life the crucial truths that Paul is address-
     ing. Ask yourself, too, what are the issues at stake here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Paul’s words here show that he fully understands the fallen nature
     of humanity. He talks about the “infirmity of your flesh.” The Greek
     word for “infirmity” means also “weakness.” He knows what fallen
     human nature, left on its own, is capable of. Thus, again, he appeals
     to the power of choice—the power we have to choose to surrender
     ourselves and our weak flesh to a new master, Jesus, who will enable
     us to live a righteous life.
        Romans 6:23 often is quoted to show that the penalty for sin—that
     is, the transgression of the law—is death. Certainly sin’s penalty is
     death. But in addition to seeing death as sin’s penalty, we should see
     sin as Paul describes it in Romans 6—as a master dominating his ser-
     vants, duping them by paying them off with the wages of death.
        Notice, too, that in his development of the figure of the two mas-
     ters, Paul calls attention to the fact that the service of one master
     means freedom from the service of the other. Again we see the clear
     choice: one or the other. There is no middle ground. At the same time,
     as we all know, being free from the dominion of sin doesn’t mean
     sinlessness, doesn’t mean we don’t struggle and, at times, even fall.
     It means, instead, that we are no longer dominated by sin, however
     much a reality it remains in our life and however much we must daily
     claim the promises of victory over it.
        Thus, this passage becomes a powerful appeal to anyone who is
     serving sin. This tyrant offers nothing but death as payment for doing
     shameful things; therefore, a reasonable person should desire eman-
     cipation from this tyrant. In contrast, those who serve righteousness
     do things that are upright and praiseworthy, not with the idea of thus
     earning their salvation, but as a fruit of their new experience. If they
     are acting in an attempt to earn salvation, they are missing the whole
     point of the gospel, the whole point of what salvation is, and the
     whole point of why they need Jesus.
                                                                         61

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Victory Appropriated,” pp. 105,
          106, in Messages to Young People; “The True Motive in Service,”
          pp. 93–95, in Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing; “Appeal to the
          Young,” p. 365, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3; pp. 1074, 1075,
          in The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6.

             “He [Jesus] did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He
          yield to temptation. So it may be with us. Christ’s humanity was
          united with divinity; He was fitted for the conflict by the indwelling
1         of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make us partakers of the divine
          nature. So long as we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more
          dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to
          lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfec-
          tion of character.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 123.
             “At our baptism we pledged ourselves to break all connection with
2         Satan and his agencies, and to put heart and mind and soul into the
          work of extending the kingdom of God. . . . The Father, the Son,
          and the Holy Spirit are pledged to cooperate with sanctified human
          instrumentalities.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible
          Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1075.
             “A profession of Christianity without corresponding faith and works
          will avail nothing. No man can serve two masters. The children of the
          wicked one are their own master’s servants; to whom they yield them-
3         selves servants to obey, his servants they are, and they cannot be the
          servants of God until they renounce the devil and all his works. It can-
          not be harmless for servants of the heavenly King to engage in the plea-
          sures and amusements which Satan’s servants engage in, even though
          they often repeat that such amusements are harmless. God has revealed
          sacred and holy truths to separate His people from the ungodly and
          purify them unto Himself. Seventh-day Adventists should live out their
          faith.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 404.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Though we have all these wonderful promises of victory over
           sin, the fact is that we all—even as born-again Christians—are
           aware of just how fallen we are, how sinful we are, and how cor-
           rupt our hearts can be. Is there a contradiction here? Explain.

           l2 In class, give a testimony about how Christ has changed your
           life.

           l
           3 However important it is that we always remember that our
           salvation rests only in what Christ has done for us, what dangers
           arise if we overemphasize that wonderful truth to the exclusion
           of the other part of salvation: that of what Jesus does in us, to
           transform us into His image? Why do we need to understand and
           emphasize both these aspects of salvation?

The Pot Sellers’ Discovery
by Benjamin Schoun
   Some Adventist pot sellers traveled from village to village across north-
ern Madagascar selling kitchenware. One Friday afternoon they arrived at a
village and asked someone whether there was an Adventist church in the
village. “No,” the person replied.
   “Does anyone in this village worship on Saturday?” they asked.
   “Yes,” the villager answered. “They meet in a house just up this road.”
The pot sellers followed the villager’s directions and found a house with
a sign that read, “The Seventh-day Keeping Church.”
   The pot sellers knocked on the door and were welcomed into a room
crowded with 50 people who had gathered for a worship service. The
members squeezed together to make room for their visitors, and the ser-
vice resumed. Soon the pot sellers realized that the worship service looked
and sounded like an Adventist meeting. But who were these people?
   When the meeting ended, the visitors asked the worshipers where
they had learned to worship as they did. “We are Christians,” the leader
explained. We listen to a radio program that teaches the Bible clearly, and
we now keep the Bible Sabbath and prepare for Jesus’ soon coming.”
   “What is the name of the radio station you listen to?” the pot sell-
ers asked. The answer came back, Adventist World Radio. The leader
explained that the believers knew that the radio station was owned by
Seventh-day Adventists, but they hesitated to use that name until they
learned what they must do to become Seventh-day Adventist members.
   The pot sellers told the congregation that they were Seventh-day
Adventists and promised to notify the district pastor of this new congre-
gation.
   When the district pastor learned of the group meeting on the moun-
tainside, he arranged to hold meetings and organize a new company of
believers. A woman donated land for a church, and today the believers in
Andravinambo worship as Seventh-day Adventists. A lay pastor contin-
ues teaching them and encouraging them to share their faith with others
in their region.
   Your mission offerings support Adventist World Radio’s ministry
around the world.

     The Man of Romans 7




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 7.

Memory Text: “Now we are delivered from the law, that being
     dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of
     spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter” (Romans 7:6).



     F
           ew chapters in the Bible have created more controversy than
           has Romans 7. Concerning the issues involved, The SDA Bible
           Commentary says, “The meaning of vs. 14–25 has been one of the
     most discussed problems in the whole epistle. The main questions have
     been as to whether the description of such intense moral struggle could
     be autobiographical, and, if so, whether the passage refers to Paul’s expe-
     rience before or after his conversion. That Paul is speaking of his own
     personal struggle with sin seems apparent from the simplest meaning of
     his words (cf. vs. 7–11; [Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 19; Ellen G.
     White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 475]). It is surely also true
     that he is describing a conflict that is more or less experienced by every
     soul confronted by and awakened to the spiritual claims of God’s holy
     law.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 553.
        Bible students differ on whether Romans 7 was Paul’s experi-
     ence before or after conversion. Whatever position one takes, what’s
     important is that Jesus’ righteousness covers us and that in His righ-
     teousness we stand perfect before God, who promises to sanctify us,
     to give us victory over sin, and to conform us to “the image of his
     Son” (Rom. 8:29). These are the crucial points for us to know and
     experience as we seek to spread “the everlasting gospel” to “every
     nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people” (Rev. 14:6).

     Bound to the Law?
Read Romans 7:1–6. What illustration does Paul use here in order
     to show his readers their relationship to the law, and what point
     is he making with that illustration?
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Paul’s illustration in Romans 7:1–6 is somewhat involved, but a
     careful analysis of the passage will help us to follow his reasoning.
       In the overall context of the letter, Paul was dealing with the system
     of worship established at Sinai; that is often what he means by the
     word law. The Jews had difficulty grasping the fact that this system,
     given to them of God, should end with the coming of the Messiah.
     This is what Paul was dealing with—Jewish believers still not ready
     to abandon what had been such an important part of their lives.
       In essence, Paul’s illustration is as follows: a woman is married to a
     man. The law binds her to him as long as he lives. During his lifetime
     she cannot consort with other men. But when he dies, she is free from
     the law that bound her to him (vs. 3).

How does Paul apply the illustration of the law of marriage to the
     system of Judaism? Rom. 7:4, 5.
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       As the death of her husband delivers the woman from the law of her
     husband, so the death of the old life in the flesh, through Jesus Christ,
     delivers the Jews from the law they had been expected to keep until
     the Messiah fulfilled its types.
       Now the Jews were free to “remarry.” They were invited to marry
     the risen Messiah and thus bring forth fruit to God. This illustration
     was one more device Paul used to convince the Jews that they were
     now free to abandon the ancient system.
       Again, given all else that Paul and the Bible say about obedience
     to the Ten Commandments, it doesn’t make sense to assert here that
     Paul was telling these Jewish believers that the Ten Commandments
     were no longer binding. Those who use these texts to try to make that
     point—that the moral law was done away with—really don’t want to
     make that point, anyway; what they really want to say is that only the
     seventh-day Sabbath is gone, not the rest of the law. To read these
     verses as teaching that the fourth commandment has been abolished
     or superceded or replaced with Sunday is to give them a meaning that
     the words were never intended to have.
                                                                          65

     Is the Law Sin?
       If Paul is talking about the whole law system at Sinai, what about
     Romans 7:7, in which he specifically mentions one of the Ten
     Commandments? Doesn’t that refute the position, taken yesterday, that
     Paul was not talking about the abolition of the Ten Commandments?
       The answer is No. We must keep in mind, again, that the word law
     for Paul is the whole system introduced at Sinai, which included the
     moral law but wasn’t limited to it. Hence, Paul could quote from it, as
     well as from any other section of the whole Jewish economy, in order
     to make his points. However, when the system passed away at the
     death of Christ, that didn’t include the moral law, which had existed
     even before Sinai and exists after Calvary, as well.

Read Romans 7:8–11. What is Paul saying here about the relation-
     ship between the law and sin?

     _______________________________________________________

        God revealed Himself to the Jews, telling them in detail what was
     right and what was wrong in moral, civil, ceremonial, and health mat-
     ters. He also explained the penalties for violation of the various laws.
     Violation of the revealed will of God is here defined as sin.
        Thus, Paul explains, he would not have known if it was a sin to covet
     without having been informed of that fact by the “law.” Because sin is the
     violation of the revealed will of God, where the revealed will is unknown,
     there is no awareness of sin. When that revealed will is made known to a
     person, he or she comes to recognize that he or she is a sinner and is under
     condemnation and death. In this sense, the person dies.
        In Paul’s line of argument here and throughout this section, he is trying
     to build a bridge to lead the Jews—who revere the “law”—to see Christ
     as its fulfillment. He is showing that the law was necessary but that its
     function was limited. The law was meant to show the need of salvation;
     it never was meant to be the means of obtaining that salvation.
        “The apostle Paul, in relating his experience, presents an important truth
     concerning the work to be wrought in conversion. He says, ‘I was alive
     without the law once’—he felt no condemnation; ‘but when the com-
     mandment came,’ when the law of God was urged upon his conscience,
     ‘sin revived, and I died.’ Then he saw himself a sinner, condemned by
     the divine law. Mark, it was Paul, and not the law, that died.”—Ellen G.
     White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1076.

      In what sense have you “died” before the law? How, in that
      context, can you understand what Jesus has done for you by
      giving you a new life in Him?

      The Holy Law
Read Romans 7:12. How do we understand this text in the context of
      what Paul has been discussing?

      _______________________________________________________

        Because the Jews revered the law, Paul exalts it in every way
      possible. The law is good for what it does, but it can’t do what it
      was never meant to do, to save us from sin. For that we need Jesus,
      because the law—whether the entire Jewish system or the moral law
      in particular—cannot bring salvation. Only Jesus and His righteous-
      ness, which comes to us by faith, can.

Whom does Paul blame for his condition of “death,” and what does
      he exonerate? Why is that distinction important? Rom. 7:13.

      _______________________________________________________

     In this verse, Paul is presenting the “law” in the best sense possible.
   He chooses to blame sin, not the law, for his terrible sinful condition;
   that is, his working “all manner of concupiscence [lust]” (vs. 8). The
   law is good, for it is God’s standard of conduct, but as a sinner, Paul
   stood condemned before it.
     					
Why was sin so successful in showing up Paul as a terrible sinner?
   Rom. 7:14, 15.

      _______________________________________________________

        Carnal means “fleshy.” Thus, Paul needed Jesus Christ. Only Jesus
      Christ could take away the condemnation (Rom. 8:1). Only Jesus
      Christ could free him from slavery to sin.
        Paul describes himself as “sold under sin.” He is a slave to sin. He
      has no freedom. He can’t do what he wants to do. He tries to do what
      the good law tells him to do, but sin won’t let him.
        By this illustration, Paul was trying to show the Jews the need of the
      Messiah. He already had pointed out that victory is possible only under
      grace (Rom 6:14). This same thought is reemphasized in Romans 7.
      Living under the “law” means enslavement to sin, a merciless master.

       What has been your own experience with how sin enslaves?
       Have you ever tried to play with sin, thinking you could con-
       trol it as you wished, only to find yourself under a vicious and
       merciless taskmaster? Welcome to reality! Why, then, must you
       surrender to Jesus, and die to self daily?
                                                                          67

     The Man of Romans 7
        “If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it
     is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
     me” (Rom. 7:16, 17). What struggle is presented in these verses?

       _____________________________________________________

       Using the law as a mirror, the Holy Spirit convicts a person that he
     or she is displeasing God by not fulfilling the requirements of the law.
     Through efforts to meet those requirements, the sinner shows that he
     or she agrees that the law is good.

What points that Paul had already made did he repeat for emphasis?
     Rom. 7:18–20.

       ______________________________________________________

        To impress upon a person his or her need of Christ, the Holy Spirit
     often leads the person through an “old covenant” type of experience.
     Ellen G. White describes Israel’s experience as follows: “The people
     did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts, and that without
     Christ it was impossible for them to keep God’s law; and they read-
     ily entered into covenant with God. Feeling that they were able to
     establish their own righteousness, they declared, ‘All that the Lord
     hath said will we do, and be obedient.’ Exodus 24:7. . . . Only a few
     weeks passed before they broke their covenant with God, and bowed
     down to worship a graven image. They could not hope for the favor of
     God through a covenant which they had broken; and now, seeing their
     sinfulness and their need of pardon, they were brought to feel their
     need of the Saviour revealed in the Abrahamic covenant.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 371, 372.
        Unfortunately, by failing to renew their dedication to Christ daily,
     many Christians are, in effect, serving sin, however loathe they may
     be to admit it. They rationalize that, in reality, they are undergoing
     the normal experience of sanctification and that they simply still have
     a long way to go. Thus, instead of taking known sins to Christ and
     asking Him for victory over them, they hide behind Romans 7, which
     tells them, they think, that it is impossible to do right. In reality, this
     chapter is saying that it is impossible to do right when a person is
     enslaved to sin, but victory is possible in Jesus Christ.

      Are you having the victories over self and sin that Christ prom-
      ises us? If not, why not? What wrong choices are you, and you
      alone, making?

      Delivered From Death
Read Romans 7:21–23. How have you experienced this same struggle
      in your own life, even as a Christian?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        In this passage, Paul equates the law in his members (his body) with
      the law of sin. “With the flesh,” Paul says, he served “the law of sin”
      (Rom. 7:25). But serving sin and obeying its law means death (see vss.
      10, 11, 13). Hence, his body—as it was now functioning in obedience
      to sin—fittingly could be described as “the body of this death.”
        The law of the mind is God’s law, God’s revelation of His will. Under
      conviction of the Holy Spirit, Paul consented to this law. His mind
      resolved to keep it, but when he tried, he couldn’t, because his body
      wanted to sin. Who hasn’t felt that same struggle? In your mind you
      know what you want to do, but your flesh clamors for something else.

How can we be rescued from this difficult situation we find ourselves
      in? Rom. 7:24, 25.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Some have wondered why, after reaching the glorious climax in the
      expression “I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord,” Paul should
      refer once more to the struggles of the soul from which he apparently
      had been delivered. Some understand the expression of thanksgiving
      as a parenthetical exclamation. They believe that such an exclamation
      follows naturally the cry, “Who shall deliver?” They hold that before
      proceeding with an extended discussion of the glorious deliverance
      (Romans 8) Paul summarizes what he has said in the preceding verses
      and confesses once again to the conflict against the forces of sin.
        Others suggest that by “I myself,” Paul means, “left to myself, leav-
      ing Christ out of the picture.” However these verses are understood,
      one point should remain clear: left to ourselves, without Christ, we
      are helpless against sin. With Christ we have a new life in Him, one
      in which—though self will constantly arise—the promises of victory
      are ours if we choose to claim them. Just as no one can breathe for
      you or cough for you or sneeze for you, no one can choose for you to
      surrender to Christ. You alone can make that choice. There’s no other
      way to attain for yourself the victories that are promised us in Jesus.
                                                                         69

            “Paul desires his brethren to see that the great glory of a sin-
         pardoning Saviour gave significance to the entire Jewish economy.
         He desired them to see also that when Christ came to the world, and
         died as man’s sacrifice, type met antitype.
            “After Christ died on the cross as a sin offering the ceremonial law

         could have no force. Yet it was connected with the moral law, and
         was glorious. The whole bore the stamp of divinity, and expressed
         the holiness, justice, and righteousness of God. And if the ministration
         of the dispensation to be done away was glorious, how much more
         must the reality be glorious, when Christ was revealed, giving His
         life-giving, sanctifying, Spirit to all who believe?”—Ellen G. White

3   Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Who do you think the man of Romans 7 is? Paul, before or
          after conversion? Or is this chapter talking about something else
          entirely? What justification do you have for your answer? In
          class discuss the answers given.

          l
          2 How do we explain the fact that even baptized, born-again
          Christians struggle with sin? Shouldn’t we automatically over-
          come everything? Or will we always be sinning? Or is the answer
          somewhere in between?

          l3 What potential dangers arise from the view that, as Christians,
          we will always be sinning, always be falling, always be violating
          God’s law, no matter what? On the other hand, what potential
          dangers arise from the view that as Christians we must over-
          come every wrong thing in our lives, every wrong thought, every
          wrong tendency—no matter what, or else we are not saved?

          l4 In the end, regardless of whatever position folk take on the
          man of Romans 7, what promises can we take from Romans 7
          for ourselves that will help us understand what it means to be
          followers of Jesus?

New Life, New Hope
by Richard LaCroix
   I was in and out of prison so many times, most often for drug-related
crimes. I even gave my life to Jesus and was baptized there. When I was
released, I was full of hope for a new life, but I couldn’t find work and
became discouraged. I ended up back in prison again.
   I was released again, and early on Sabbath morning a man shook me
awake saying, “Brother Barker [the prison ministries leader] sent me to
fetch you to church—now!” I got up and went to church with him.
   This man took me to a Seventh-day Adventist church founded by the
prison ministries team. It was the grand opening day, and what a joyful
day it was! I returned home filled with joy, only to face reality. I was
an addict, and I had no strength of my own to quit. I had bought drugs
with money that church members gave me for food! I couldn’t face these
people.
   I was lost in drugs. But one day God said to me, “Do you want this?
Or do you want a better life?” I asked God to do whatever it took to clean
me up. So when I was arrested and sent to prison again, I actually thanked
the judge.
   The day after I arrived in prison I told cellmates that I didn’t want to see
any drugs or know of any drugs. Not even cigarettes.
   I went to the church in prison, where Brother Barker led out. We studied
and prayed together, and I recommitted myself to Christ. I asked forgive-
ness for all the wrong things I had done and prayed for my family and
friends I had wronged. Although I was in prison, I was free!
   God strengthened me with His Word, and I began working with others
who were bound by chains of sin and addiction. Every day I committed
myself to God, for I knew I couldn’t do it alone.
   When I was discharged I went to the New Hope Prison Ministries
Adventist Church and found a welcome from others who knew the strug-
gles I faced. The church members helped me find a job and get settled into
a new life. The devil still pressures me with temptations and distractions,
but God sustains me.
   I asked for deliverance from drugs, and God gave me so much more.
He’s given me a new life, new work, and new joy.
   Your mission offerings help fund the prison ministries program in
Trinidad. And that program helped me find victory in Jesus. Thank you.

     Freedom in Christ




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 8:1–17.

Memory Text: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them
     which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after
     the Spirit” (Romans 8:1).



     R
             omans 8 is Paul’s answer to Romans 7. In Romans 7 Paul
             speaks of frustration, failure, and condemnation; in Romans 8
             the condemnation is gone, replaced with freedom and victory
     through Jesus Christ.
        Paul was saying in Romans 7 that if you refuse to accept Jesus
     Christ, the wretched experience of Romans 7 will be yours. You will
     be slaves to sin, unable to do what you choose to do. In Romans 8 he
     says that Christ Jesus offers you deliverance from sin and the freedom
     to do the good that you want to do but your flesh won’t allow.
        Paul continues, explaining that this freedom was purchased at infi-
     nite cost. Christ the Son of God took on humanity, the only way He
     could relate to us, could be our perfect example, and could become
     the substitute who died in our stead. He came “in the likeness of sinful
     flesh” (vs. 3). As a result, the righteous requirements of the law can be
     fulfilled in us (vs. 4). In other words, Christ made victory over sin, as
     well as meeting the positive requirements of the law, possible.
        Because of space limitations, we will cover only the first 17 verses of
     Romans 8. As time allows, read the rest of the chapter, which is filled
     with wonderful assurances of God’s love. These verses powerfully point
     us to the hope we should have as people who are “more than conquerors
     through him that loved us” (vs. 37) and who, out of that love, “spared not
     his								
         own Son, but delivered him up for us all” (vs. 32).

     Freedom From Condemnation
        “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
     Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit”
     (Rom. 8:1). What does “no condemnation” mean? No condemna-
     tion from what? And why is this such good news?

     _______________________________________________________

        “In Christ Jesus” is a common phrase in the Pauline writings. For a
     person to be “in” Christ Jesus means that he or she has accepted Christ
     as his or her Savior. The person trusts Him implicitly and has decided
     to make Christ’s way of life his or her own way. The result is a close
     personal union with Christ.
        “In Christ Jesus” is contrasted with “in the flesh.” It also is contrasted
     with the experience detailed in chapter 7, where Paul describes the
     person under conviction before his or her surrender to Christ as carnal,
     meaning that he or she is a slave to sin. The person is under condemna-
     tion of death (vss. 11, 13, 24). He or she serves the “law of sin” (vss. 23,
     25). This person is in a terrible state of wretchedness (vs. 24).
        But then the person surrenders to Jesus, an immediate change is
     wrought in his or her standing with God. Formerly condemned as a
     lawbreaker, that person now stands perfect in the sight of God, stands
     as if he or she had never sinned, because the righteousness of Jesus
     Christ completely covers that person. There is no more condemnation,
     not because the person is faultless, sinless, or worthy of eternal life
     (he or she is not!), but because Jesus’ perfect life record stands in the
     person’s stead; thus, there is no condemnation.
        But the good news doesn’t end there.

What frees a person from slavery to sin? Rom. 8:2.


       “The law of the Spirit of life” here means Christ’s plan for saving
     humanity, in contrast with “the law of sin and death,” which was
     described in chapter 7 as the law by which sin ruled, the end of which
     was death. Christ’s law instead brings life and freedom.

      “Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the control
      of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of freedom, but
      he is in the most abject slavery. . . . While he flatters himself that
      he is following the dictates of his own judgment, he obeys the will
      of the prince of darkness. Christ came to break the shackles of
      sin-slavery from the soul.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
      p. 466. Are you a slave, or are you free in Christ? How can you
      know for sure?

     What the Law Could Not Do
        However good, the “law” (the ceremonial law, the moral law, or
     even both) cannot do for us what we need the most, and that is to pro-
     vide the means of salvation, a means of saving us from the condemna-
     tion and death that sin brings. For that, we need Jesus.

Read Romans 8:3, 4. What did Christ do that the law, by its very
     nature, cannot do?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        God provided a remedy by “sending his own Son in the likeness of
     sinful flesh,” and He “condemned sin in the flesh.” The incarnation
     of Christ was an important step in the plan of salvation. It is proper to
     exalt the Cross, but in the outworking of the plan of salvation, Christ’s
     life “in the likeness of sinful flesh” was extremely important, too.
        As a result of what God has done in sending Christ, it is now pos-
     sible for us to meet the righteous requirement of the law; that is, to do
     the right things that the law requires. “Under the law” (Rom. 6:14),
     this was impossible; “in Christ” it is now possible.
        Yet, we must remember that doing what the law requires doesn’t
     mean keeping the law well enough to earn salvation. That’s not an
     option—never was. It means simply living the life that God enables
     us to live; it means a life of obedience, one in which we have “cruci-
     fied the flesh with its passions and desires” (Gal. 5:24, NKJV), a life
     in which we reflect the character of Christ.
        “Walk” in verse 4 is an idiomatic expression signifying “to con-
     duct oneself.” The word flesh here denotes the unregenerate person,
     whether before or after conviction. To walk after the flesh is to be
     controlled by selfish desires. In contrast, to walk after the Spirit is to
     fulfill the righteous requirement of the law. Only through the help of
     the Holy Spirit can we meet this requirement. Only in Christ Jesus is
     there freedom to do what the law requires. Apart from Christ, there is
     no such freedom. The one who is enslaved to sin finds it impossible
     to do the good he or she chooses to do (see Rom. 7:15, 18).

      How well are you keeping the law? Putting aside any notions of
      earning salvation by the law, is your life one in which the “righ-
      teousness of the law” is fulfilled? If not, why not? What kind of
      lame excuses are you using to rationalize your behavior?

     Flesh Versus Spirit
       “They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
     but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be
     carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and
     peace” (Rom. 8:5, 6). Dwell on these texts. What basic message
     comes through from them? What do they say to you about how
     you are living your life?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       “After,” here, is used in the sense of “according to” (Greek kata).
     “Mind” here means “to set the mind on.” One group of people sets its
     mind on fulfilling natural desires; the other sets its mind on the things
     of the Spirit, to follow His dictates. Because the mind determines
     actions, the two groups live and act differently.

What is the carnal mind unable to do? Rom. 8:7, 8.

     _______________________________________________________

       To have one’s mind set on fulfilling the desires of the flesh is, in
     reality, to be in a state of enmity against God. One whose mind is thus
     set is unconcerned about doing the will of God. He or she even may
     be in rebellion against Him, openly flouting His law.
       Paul wishes especially to emphasize that, apart from Christ, it is
     impossible to keep the law of God. Again and again Paul returns to
     this theme: no matter how hard one tries, apart from Christ one cannot
     obey the law.
       Paul’s special purpose was to persuade the Jews that they needed
     more than their Torah (law). By their conduct they had shown that, in
     spite of having the divine revelation, they were guilty of the same sins
     of which the Gentiles were guilty (Romans 2). The lesson of all this
     was that they needed the Messiah. Without Him they would be slaves
     of sin, unable to escape its dominion.
       This was Paul’s answer to those Jews who couldn’t understand why
     what God had given them in the Old Testament was no longer enough
     for salvation. Paul admitted that what they had been doing was all good,
     but they also needed to accept the Messiah who had now come.

      Look at your past 24 hours. Were your deeds of the Spirit or
      of the flesh? What does your answer tell you about yourself?
      If of the flesh, what changes must you make, and how can you
      make them?
                                                                          75

     The Spirit in Us
       Paul continues his theme, contrasting the two possibilities that
     people face in how they live: either according to the Spirit; that is,
     the Holy Spirit of God, which is promised to us, or according to their
     sinful and carnal nature. One leads to eternal life, the other to eternal
     death. There is no middle ground. Or, as Jesus said, “He who is not
     with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters”
     (Matt. 12:30, NKJV). It’s hard to get plainer, or more black and white,
     than that.

Read Romans 8:9–14. What is promised to those who surrender
     themselves fully to Christ?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The life “in the flesh” is contrasted with life “in the Spirit.” The life
     “in the Spirit” is controlled by the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit. He
     is in this chapter called the Spirit of Christ, perhaps in the sense that
     He is a representative of Christ, and through Him Christ dwells in the
     believer (vss. 9, 10).
        In these verses, Paul returns to a figure he used in Romans 6:1–11.
     Figuratively, in baptism “the body of sin,” that is, the body that served
     sin, is destroyed. The “old man is crucified with him” (vs. 6). But, as
     in baptism, there is not only a burial but also a resurrection, so the
     person baptized rises to walk in the newness of life. This means to put
     to death the old self, a choice that we have to, of ourselves, make day
     by day, moment by moment. God does not destroy human freedom.
     Even after the old man of sin is destroyed, it still is possible to sin.
     To the Colossians Paul wrote, “Mortify [put to death] therefore your
     members which are upon the earth” (Col. 3:5).
        Thus, after conversion there still will be a struggle against sin.
     The difference is that the person whom the Spirit indwells now has
     divine power for victory. Furthermore, because the person has been so
     miraculously freed from the slave master of sin, he or she is obligated
     never to serve sin again.

      Dwell on this idea that the Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from
      death, is the same one dwelling in us, if we allow Him to. Think
      about the power that is there for us! What keeps us from avail-
      ing ourselves of it as we should?

      Adoption Versus Bondage
How does Paul describe the new relationship in Christ? Rom. 8:15.
      What hope is found in this promise for us? How do we make it
      real in our lives?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         The new relationship is described as freedom from fear. A slave is
      in bondage. He lives in a state of constant fear of his master. He stands
      to gain nothing from his long years of service.
         Not so with the one who accepts Jesus Christ. First, he or she
      renders voluntary service. Second, he or she serves without fear, for
      “perfect love casteth out fear” (1 John 4:18). Third, adopted as a son,
      he or she becomes heir to an inheritance of infinite worth.
         “The spirit of bondage is engendered by seeking to live in accor-
      dance with legal religion, through striving to fulfill the claims of
      the law in our own strength. There is hope for us only as we come
      under the Abrahamic covenant, which is the covenant of grace by
      faith in Christ Jesus.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1077.

What gives us the assurance that God has indeed accepted us as chil-
      dren? Rom. 8:16.

      _______________________________________________________

         The inward witness of the Spirit confirms our acceptance. While
      it is not safe to go merely by feeling, those who to the best of their
      understanding have followed the light of the Word will hear an inward
      authenticating voice assuring them that they have been accepted as
      children of God.
         Indeed, Romans 8:17 tells us that we are heirs; that is, we are part of the
      family of God and, as heirs, as children, we receive a wonderful inheri-
      tance from our Father. We don’t earn it; it is given to us by virtue of our
      new status in God, a status granted to us through His grace, which has
      been made available to us because of the death of Jesus in our behalf.

       How close are you to the Lord? Do you really know Him, or just
       about Him? What changes must you make in your life in order
       to have a closer walk with your Creator and Redeemer? What
       holds you back, and why?

            “The plan of salvation does not offer believers a life free from suf-

         them to follow Christ in the same path of self-denial and reproach.

         . . . It is through such trial and persecution that the character of Christ
         is reproduced and revealed in His people. . . . By sharing in the suf-
         ferings of Christ we are educated and disciplined and made ready to

            “The chain that has been let down from the throne of God is long enough
2
         to reach to the lowest depths. Christ is able to lift the most sinful out of the
         pit of degradation, and to place them where they will be acknowledged as
         children of God, heirs with Christ to an immortal inheritance.”—Ellen G.
         White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 229.
            “One honored of all heaven came to this world to stand in human
         nature at the head of humanity, testifying to the fallen angels and to

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Read again the quotes from Ellen G. White in Friday’s study.
          What hope can we take from them for ourselves? More impor-
          tant, how can we make these promises of victory real in our own
          lives? Why, with so much offered us in Christ, do we keep on
          falling far short of what we really could be?

          l
          2 What are practical, daily ways you can have your mind “set
          . . . on the things of the Spirit” (Rom. 8:5, RSV). What does that
          mean? What does the Spirit desire? What do you watch, read, or
          think about that makes this difficult to achieve in your life?

          l
          3 Dwell more on this idea that we are either on one side or the
          other in the great controversy, with no middle ground. What are
          the implications of that stark, cold fact? How should the realiza-
          tion of this important truth impact how we live and the choices
          we make, even in the “small” things?

The Search: Part 1
by Crepin Agbodedji
  I live in the country of Benin in West Africa. My father died when
I was little, so my uncle raised me. He practiced voodoo and animism
and wanted nothing to do with Christianity.
  When I was old enough, my uncle apprenticed me to a builder so I
could learn a trade. But as I neared the end of my training, my uncle
became insanely jealous of me. He threatened me and cursed me. My
aunt took me to a voodoo priest to perform a ceremony to protect me,
but my uncle continued to persecute me.
  I told my aunt that I doubted that the voodoo had worked and
pointed to my friend who had studied with me. He was a Christian,
and he already had his own shop and was married. I didn’t even have
a job. I wondered whether attending a Christian church could help
me find work. My aunt warned me that if I went to a Christian church
I would lose the protection that the voodoo priest had bestowed on
me.
  I discovered that my uncle’s son had a little New Testament that he
read. And he sneaked away to attend a church on Sunday. Somehow
my uncle never knew. Then my cousin became seriously ill. My aunt
told me, “See what happens when you sneak away and go to church?”
My cousin wasn’t expected to survive, but he did. Even the doctor
said it was a miracle.
  About that time a man came to my uncle looking for a room to rent.
My uncle rented him a room in a house far from where he lived. He
told me to go live in that house as well.
  I noticed that this new renter was somehow different. He was well
dressed and kept his room very clean. I often heard him talking alone
                          in his room, but I couldn’t hear what he
                          said. I also noticed that he read a lot from
                          a certain book. I discovered that he was a
                          Christian.

     Redemption for Jew
     and Gentile




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 9.

Memory Text: “Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have
     mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth” (Romans 9:18).



     A
             s it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. . . . For
             he saith to Moses, I will have mercy . . . and I will have compas-
             sion on whom I will have compassion” (Rom. 9:13, 15).
       What is Paul talking about here? What about human free will, and
     the freedom to choose, without which very little of what we believe
     makes sense? Are we not free to choose or reject God, or are these
     verses teaching that certain people are elected to be saved and others
     to be lost, regardless of their own personal choices?
       The answer is found, as usual, by looking at the bigger picture of
     what Paul is saying. Paul is following a line of argument in which
     he attempts to show God’s right to pick those whom He will use as
     His “elected” ones. After all, God is the One who carries the ultimate
     responsibility of evangelizing the world. Therefore, why can He not
     choose as His agents whomever He wills? So long as God cuts no one
     off from the opportunity of salvation, such an action on God’s part is
     not contrary to the principles of free will. Even more important, it’s
     not contrary to the great truth that Christ died for all humans, and His
     desire is that everyone have salvation.
       As long as we remember that Romans 9 is not dealing with the
     personal salvation of those it names but with their call to do a certain
     work, the chapter presents no difficulties.

     Paul’s Burden
       “And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
     nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the chil-
     dren of Israel” (Exod. 19:6).

       God needed a missionary people to evangelize a world steeped in
     paganism, darkness, and idolatry. He chose the Israelites and revealed
     Himself to them. He planned that they would become a model nation
     and thus attract others to the true God. It was God’s purpose that by the
     revelation of His character through Israel, the world should be drawn unto
     Him. Through the teaching of the sacrificial service, Christ was to be
     uplifted before the nations, and all who would look unto Him should live.
     As the numbers of Israel increased, as their blessings grew, they were to
     enlarge their borders until their kingdom should embrace the world.

Read Romans 9:1–12. What point is Paul making here about the
     faithfulness of God amid human failures?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Paul is building a line of argument in which he will show that the
     promise made to Israel had not completely failed. There exists a rem-
     nant through whom God still aims to work. To establish the validity
     of the idea of the remnant, Paul dips back into Israelite history. He
     shows that God has always been selective: (1) God did not choose all
     the seed of Abraham to be His covenant, only the line of Isaac. (2) He
     did not choose all of the descendants of Isaac, only those of Jacob.
       It’s important, too, to see that heritage, or ancestry, does not guar-
     antee salvation. You can be of the right blood, the right family, even
     of the right church, and yet be lost, still be outside the promise. It is
     faith, a faith that works by love, that reveals those who are “children
     of the promise” (Rom. 9:8).

      Look at the phrase in Romans 9:6: “For they are not all Israel,
      which are of Israel.” What important message can we find there
      for ourselves, as Adventists, who in many ways play the same
      role in our day that the ancient Israelites did in theirs?

     Elected
      “It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it is
     written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated” (Rom. 9:12, 13).

        As stated in the introduction for this week, it is impossible to under-
     stand Romans 9 properly until one recognizes that Paul is not speak-
     ing of individual salvation. He is here speaking of particular roles God
     was calling upon certain individuals to play. God wanted Jacob to
     be the progenitor of the people who would be His special evangeliz-
     ing agency in the world. There is no implication in this passage that
     Esau could not be saved. God wanted him to be saved as much as He
     desires all men and women to be saved.

Read Romans 9:14, 15. How do we understand these words in the
     context of what we have been reading?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Paul is again not speaking of individual salvation, because in that
     area God extends mercy to all, for He “will have all men to be saved”
     (1 Tim. 2:4). “The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
     to all men” (Titus 2:11). But God can choose nations to play a role,
     and though they can refuse to play that role, they cannot prevent
     God’s choice. No matter how hard Esau may have willed it, he could
     not have become the progenitor of the Messiah nor of the chosen
     people.
       In the end, it was no arbitrary choice on the part of God, not some
     divine decree, by which Esau was shut out from salvation. The gifts
     of His grace through Christ are free to all. We’ve all been elected to
     be saved, not lost (Eph. 1:4, 5; 2 Pet. 1:10). It’s our own choices, not
     God’s, that keep us from the promise of eternal life in Christ. Jesus
     died for every human being. Yet, God has set forth in His Word the
     conditions upon which every soul will be elected to eternal life: faith
     in Christ, which leads the justified sinner to obedience.

      You, yourself, as if no one else even existed, were chosen in
      Christ even before the foundation of the world, to have salva-
      tion. This is your calling, your election, all given to you, by
      God, through Jesus. What a privilege, what a hope! Why, all
      things considered, does everything else pale in comparison to
      this great promise? Why would it be the greatest of all tragedies
      to let sin, self, and the flesh take away from you all that’s been
      promised you in Jesus?

       “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
     my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the
     earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
     than your thoughts” (Isa. 55:8, 9).

Read Romans 9:17–24. Given what we have read so far, how are we
     to understand Paul’s point here?

        In dealing with Egypt at the time of the Exodus in the manner He
     did, God was working for the salvation of the human race. God’s
     revelation of Himself in the plagues of Egypt and in the deliverance
     of His people was designed to reveal to the Egyptians, as well as to
     other nations, that the God of Israel indeed was the true God. It was
     designed to be an invitation for the peoples of the nations to abandon
     their gods and to come and worship Him.
        Obviously Pharaoh had already made his choice against God, so
     that in hardening his heart God was not cutting him off from the
     opportunity of salvation. The hardening was against the appeal to let
     Israel go, not against God’s appeal for Pharaoh to accept personal
     salvation. Christ died for Pharaoh, just as much as for Moses, Aaron,
     and the rest of the children of Israel.
        The crucial point in all this is that as fallen human beings, we have such
     a narrow view of the world, of reality, and of God and how He works in
     the world. How can we expect to understand all of God’s ways when the
     natural world, everywhere we turn, holds mysteries we can’t understand?
     After all, it was only in the past one hundred fifty or two hundred years
     that doctors learned it might be a good idea to wash their hands before
     performing surgery! That’s how steeped in ignorance we have been. And
     who knows, if time should last, what other things we will discover in the
     future that will reveal just how steeped in ignorance we are today?

      Sure, we don’t always understand God’s ways, but Jesus came
      to reveal to us what God is like (John 14:9). Why, then, amid all
      of life’s mysteries and unexpected events, is it so crucial for us
      to dwell on the character of Christ and what He has revealed
      to us about God and His love for us? How can knowing what
      God’s character is like help us stay faithful amid trials that
      seem so unjustified and so unfair?
                                                                              83

     Ammi: “My People”
        		
        In Romans 9:25, Paul quotes Hosea 2:23, and in verse 26 he quotes
     Hosea 1:10. The background is that God instructed Hosea to take “a
     wife of whoredoms” (Hos. 1:2) as an illustration of God’s relationship
     with Israel, because the nation had gone after strange gods. The chil-
     dren born to this marriage were given names signifying God’s rejec-
     tion and punishment of idolatrous Israel. The third child was named
     Loammi (Hos. 1:9), meaning literally “not my people.”
        Yet, amid all this, Hosea predicted the day would come when, after
     punishing His people, God would restore their fortunes, take away
     their false gods, and make a covenant with them. (See Hos. 2:11–19.)
     At this point those who were Loammi, “not my people,” would
     become Ammi, “my people.”
        In Paul’s day, the Ammi were “even us . . . not of the Jews only, but
     also of the Gentiles” (Rom. 9:24). What a clear and powerful presen-
     tation of the gospel, a gospel that from the start was intended for the
     whole world. No wonder we as Seventh-day Adventists take part of
     our calling from this verse: “Then I saw another angel flying in the
     midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who
     dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (Rev.
     14:6, NKJV). Today, as in Paul’s day, and as in the days of ancient
     Israel, the good news of salvation is to be spread to all the world.

Read Romans 9:25–29. (Notice how much Paul quotes the Old
     Testament to make his point about the things that were hap-
     pening in his day.) What is the basic message found in all these
     verses? What hope is being offered there to his readers?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The fact that some of Paul’s kinsmen rejected the appeal of the
     gospel gave him “great heaviness and continual sorrow” in his heart
     (Rom. 9:2). But at least there was a remnant. God’s promises do not
     fail, even when humans do. The hope we can have is that, in the end,
     God’s promises will be fulfilled, and if we claim those promises for
     ourselves, they will be fulfilled in us, as well.

      How often have people failed you? How often have you failed
      yourself and failed others? Probably more times than you can
      count, right? What lessons can you learn from these failures
      about where your ultimate trust must lie?

Stumbling
  		
  “What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righ-
teousness which is of faith. But Israel, which followed after the
law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith” (Rom. 9:30–32).
What’s the message here, and, more important, how can we take
this message, written in a certain time and place, and apply the
principles to ourselves today? How can we avoid making the same
mistakes in our context that some Israelites did in theirs?

_______________________________________________________

   In words that cannot be misunderstood, Paul explains to his kins-
men why they are missing out on something God wishes them to
have, and more than that, on something they were actually pursuing
but not achieving.
   Interestingly, the Gentiles whom God had accepted had not even
been striving for such acceptance. They had been pursuing their own
interests and goals when the gospel message came to them. Grasping
its value, they accepted it. God declared them righteous because they
accepted Jesus Christ as their Substitute. It was a transaction of faith.
   The problem with the Israelites was that they stumbled at the stum-
bling stone (see Rom. 9:33). Some, not all (see Acts 2:41), refused to
accept Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah whom God had sent. He did
not meet their expectations of the Messiah; hence, when He came,
they turned their backs on Him.
   Before this chapter ends, Paul quotes another Old Testament text:
“As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed” (Rom.
9:33). In this passage Paul shows, again, just how crucial true faith is
in the plan of salvation (see also 1 Pet. 2:6–8). A rock of offense? And
yet, whoever believes in Him shall not be ashamed? Yes, for many,
Jesus is a stumbling block, but for those who know Him, and love Him,
He is another kind of rock, “the rock of my salvation” (Ps. 89:26).

 Have you ever found Jesus to be a “stumbling block” or a “rock
 of offense”? If so, how so? That is, what were you doing that
 brought you into that situation? How did you get out, and what
 did you learn so that, one hopes, you never find yourself in that
 type of contrary relationship with Jesus again?

            “There is an election of individuals and a people, the only election
         found in the word of God, where man is elected to be saved. Many
1
         have looked at the end, thinking they were surely elected to have
         heavenly bliss; but this is not the election the Bible reveals. Man is
         elected to work out his own salvation with fear and trembling. He
         is elected to put on the armor, to fight the good fight of faith. He
         is elected to use the means God has placed within his reach to war
         against every unholy lust, while Satan is playing the game of life for
2
         his soul. He is elected to watch unto prayer, to search the Scriptures,
         and to avoid entering into temptation. He is elected to have faith con-
         tinually. He is elected to be obedient to every word that proceedeth
         out of the mouth of God, that he may be, not a hearer only, but a doer
         of the word. This is Bible election.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies to
         Ministers and Gospel Workers, pp. 453, 454.
            “No finite mind can fully comprehend the character or the works of
         the Infinite One. We cannot by searching find out God. To minds the
3
         strongest and most highly cultured, as well as to the weakest and most
         ignorant, that holy Being must remain clothed in mystery. But though
         ‘clouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judg-
         ment are the foundation of His throne.’ Psalm 97:2, R.V. We can so far
         comprehend His dealing with us as to discern boundless mercy united to
         infinite power. We can understand as much of His purposes as we are
         capable of comprehending; beyond this we may still trust the hand that is
         omnipotent, the heart that is full of love.”—Ellen G. White, Education,
         p. 169.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Certain Christians teach that, even before we were born, God
          chose some to be saved and some to be lost. If you happened
          to have been one of those whom God, in His infinite love and
          wisdom, preordained to be lost, then no matter the choices you
          make, you are doomed to perdition, which many people believe
          means burning in hell for eternity. In other words, through no
          choice of our own, but only through God’s providence, some are
          predestined to live without a saving relationship with Jesus here
          in this life, only to spend the next one burning forever in the fires
          of hell. How does that view contrast with our understanding?

          ing in the world today paralleling the role of ancient Israel in its

          are we doing better? Or are we doing worse? Justify your answer.

The Search: Part 2
by Crepin Agbodedji
   I was happy to learn that Alexander, the man living in my uncle’s house,
was a Christian. I asked him many questions about God, and we began
praying together. I was careful not to let my uncle know of my interest in
God, fearing he might kill me.
   One night I dreamed that a man with an animal’s face was trying to
choke me. I tried to call on Jesus, but I couldn’t speak. But when I said
“Jesus” in my heart, the wind blew this man away. I woke up. When I
told Alexander my dream, he said that God was calling me. “You must
give your life to God,” he said. But I was afraid—afraid of my uncle and
afraid of the devil.
   Then I broke out with hives all over my body. I thought I got the hives
because I was praying, so I stopped praying. But the hives got worse. My
aunt took me to a voodoo priest to be cured, but he wanted money, and I
had none. I returned home unhealed.
   “Why do you go to the voodoo priest?” Alexander asked. “Let’s pray
to God. He will heal you for free.” We prayed, and the next day the hives
were gone.
   The evangelist invited me to go to church with him, and I agreed,
though I was still afraid. The church was different from any I had visited,
and I told my cousins about it. They wanted to attend the next Sabbath,
so we all went together.
   My uncle was furious when he found out that we had gone to church.
He warned me that the voodoo gods would punish me. But suddenly I was
no longer afraid. I told my uncle, “Let me try the Christian religion,” I
suggested. “If I fail, I will come back to voodoo.”
   “OK,” he said. “But when you suffer, don’t come to me.” I continued
worshiping with Alexander and attending church with him. Within six
months I was baptized.
   My uncle had warned me that I wouldn’t be able to find work unless I
worked on Saturday too. But after my baptism I found more work than I
could handle.
   My uncle doesn’t bother me about my faith anymore. He sees that God
is blessing me. He won’t let me speak to his sons though, or let them visit
the Seventh-day Adventist church with me. So I show them through my
life that I am a happy Christian.

      Lesson             11 *September 4–10
     The Election of Grace




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 10, 11.

Memory Text: “I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God
     forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the
     tribe of Benjamin” (Romans 11:1).



     T
             his week’s lesson covers Romans 10 and 11, with a focus espe-
             cially on chapter 11. It’s important to read both chapters in their
             entirety in order to continue to follow Paul’s line of thinking.
        These two chapters have been, and remain, the focal point of much
     discussion. One point, however, comes clear through them all, and
     that is God’s love for humanity and His great desire to see all human-
     ity saved. There is no corporate rejection of anyone for salvation.
     Romans 10 makes it very clear that “there is no difference between
     the Jew and the Greek” (Rom. 10:12)—all are sinners and all need
     God’s grace as given to the world through Jesus Christ. This grace
     comes to all—not by nationality, not by birth, and not by works of the
     law but by faith in Jesus, who died as the Substitute for sinners every-
     where. Roles may change, but the basic plan of salvation never does.
        Paul continues with this theme in chapter 11. Here, too, as stated
     earlier, it’s important to understand that when Paul talks about elec-
     tion and calling, the issue isn’t one of salvation but one of the role in
     God’s plan for reaching the world. No one group has been rejected for
     salvation; that was never the issue. Instead, after the Cross, and after
     the introduction of the gospel to the Gentiles, particularly through
     Paul, the early movement of believers—both Jew and Gentile—took
     on the mantle of evangelizing the world.

     The End of the Law
Read Romans 10:1–4. Keeping in mind all that came before, what’s
     the message here? How could we, today, be in danger of seeking
     to establish our “own righteousness”?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Legalism can come in many forms, some more subtle than others.
     Those who look to themselves, to their good deeds, to their diet, to
     how strictly they keep the Sabbath, to all the bad things they don’t
     do, or to the good things that they have achieved—even with the best
     of intentions—are falling into the trap of legalism. We must every
     moment of our lives keep before us the holiness of God in contrast to
     our sinfulness; that’s the surest way to protect ourselves from the kind
     of thinking that leads folk into seeking their “own righteousness,”
     which is contrary to the righteousness of Christ.
        Romans 10:4 is an important text that catches the essence of Paul’s
     entire message to the Romans. First, we need to know the context.
     Many Jews were “going about to establish their own righteousness”
     (Rom. 10:3) and seeking “the righteousness which is of the law”
     (Rom. 10:5). But with the coming of the Messiah, the true way of
     righteousness was presented. Righteousness was offered to all who
     would fix their faith in Christ. He was the one to whom the ancient
     ceremonial system had pointed.
        Even if one includes in the definition of law here the Ten Com-
     mandments, this doesn’t mean that the Ten Commandments were
     done away with. The moral law points out our sins, our faults, and our
     shortcomings and thus leads us to our need of a Savior, our need of
     forgiveness, our need of righteousness, all of which are found only in
     Jesus. In that sense, Christ is the “end” of the law, in that the law leads
     us to Him and His righteousness. The Greek word for “end” here is
     teloes, which also can be translated “goal” or “purpose.” Christ is the
     final purpose of the law, in that the law is to lead us to Jesus.
        To see this text as teaching that the Ten Commandments—or spe-
     cifically the fourth (what folk really mean)—are now nullified is to
     draw a conclusion that goes against so much else of what Paul and the
     New Testament teach.

      Do you ever find yourself proud about how good you are, espe-
      cially in contrast to others? Maybe you are “better,” but so
      what? Compare yourself to Christ, and then think about how
      “good” you really are.

     The Election of Grace
Read Romans 11:1–7. What common teaching does this passage
     clearly and irrevocably deny?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        In the first part of his answer to the question, “Hath God cast away
     his people?” Paul points to a remnant, an election of grace, as proof
     that God has not cast away His people. Salvation is open for all who
     accept it, Jew and Gentile alike.
        It should be remembered that the early converts to Christianity were
     all Jews—for example, the group that was converted on the Day of
     Pentecost. It took a special vision and miracle to convince Peter that
     the Gentiles had equal access to the grace of Christ (Acts 10; compare
     Acts 15:7–9) and that the gospel was to be carried to them, as well.

Read Romans 11:7–10. Is Paul saying that God purposely blinded
     to salvation the part of Israel that rejected Jesus? What’s wrong
     with that idea?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        In these verses, Paul quotes from the Old Testament, which the
     Jews accepted as authoritative. The passages that Paul cites represent
     God as giving to Israel a spirit of slumber, preventing their seeing and
     hearing. Does God blind people’s eyes to prevent them from seeing
     light that would lead them to salvation? Never! These passages must
     be understood in the light of our explanation of Romans 9. Paul is not
     talking of individual salvation, for God rejects no one group en masse
     for salvation. The issue here, instead, as it has been all along, deals
     with the role that these folk play in His work.

      What is so wrong with the idea that God has rejected en masse
      any group of people in terms of salvation? Why is that counter
      to the whole teaching of the gospel, which at the core shows that
      Christ died to save all human beings? How, for example, in the
      case of the Jews, has this idea led to tragic results?

     The Grafted Branch
Read Romans 11:11–15. What great hope does Paul present in these
     verses?

     _______________________________________________________

        In these verses, we find two parallel expressions: (1) “their [the
     Israelites’] fulness” (vs. 12), and (2) “the receiving of them [the
     Israelites]” (vs. 15). Paul envisioned the diminishing and the casting
     away to be only temporary and to be followed by fullness and recep-
     tion. This is Paul’s second answer to the question raised at the begin-
     ning of this chapter, “Hath God cast away his people?” What appears
     to be a casting away, he says, is only a temporary situation.

Read Romans 11:16–24. What is Paul saying to us here?

     _______________________________________________________

        Paul likens the faithful remnant in Israel to a noble olive tree, some
     of whose branches have been broken off (the unbelieving ones)—an
     illustration he used to prove that “God hath not cast away his people”
     (vs. 2). The root and trunk are still there.
        Into this tree the believing Gentiles have been grafted. But they are
     drawing their sap and vitality from the root and trunk, which represent
     believing Israel.
        What happened to those who rejected Jesus could happen also to
     the believing Gentiles. The Bible teaches no doctrine of “once saved,
     always saved.” Just as salvation is freely offered, it freely can be
     rejected. Though we have to be careful of thinking that every time
     we fall we are out of salvation, or that unless we are perfect we aren’t
     saved, we need to avoid the opposite ditch as well—the idea that once
     God’s grace covers us, there is nothing we can do, no choices we can
     make, that will take the provision of salvation away from us. In the end,
     only those who “continue in his goodness” (vs. 22) will be saved.
        No believer should boast of his or her own goodness or feel any
     superiority over his or her fellow human beings. Our salvation was
     not earned; it is a gift. Before the Cross, before the standard of God’s
     holiness, we all are equal: sinners in need of divine grace, sinners in
     need of a holiness that can be ours only through grace. We have noth-
     ing of ourselves to boast about; our boasting should be only in Jesus
     and what He has done for us by coming into this world in human
     flesh, suffering our woes, dying for our sins, offering us a model for
     how we are to live, and promising us the power to live that life. In
     it all, we are completely dependent upon Him, for without Him we
     would have no hope beyond what this world itself offers.
                                                                          91

     A Mystery Revealed
Read Romans 11:25–27. What great events is Paul predicting here?

       _____________________________________________________

        _____________________________________________________
        							
        Christians have been discussing and debating these few verses for
     centuries now. A few points, however, are clear. For starters, the
     whole tenor here is that of God reaching out to the Jews. What Paul
     is saying comes in reply to the question raised at the beginning of the
     chapter, “Hath God cast away his people?” His answer, of course, is
     no, and his explanation is (1) that the blindness (Greek porosis, “hard-
     ness”) is only “in part,” and (2) that it is only temporary, “until the
     fulness of the Gentiles be come in.”
        What does “the fulness of the Gentiles” mean? Many see this phrase
     as a way of expressing the fulfillment of the gospel commission, in
     which all the world hears the gospel. “The fulness of the Gentiles”
     has come in when the gospel has been preached everywhere. The faith
     of Israel, manifested in Christ, is universalized. The gospel has been
     preached to all the world. The coming of Jesus is near. At this point,
     then, many Jews start coming to Jesus.
        Another difficult point is the meaning of “all Israel shall be saved”
     (vs. 26). This must not be construed to mean every Jew will by
     some divine decree have salvation in the end time. Nowhere do the
     Scriptures preach universalism, either for the entire human race or for
     a particular segment. Paul was hoping to save “some of them” (vs.
     14). Some accepted the Messiah, some rejected Him, as it is with all
     people groups.
        Commenting on Romans 11, Ellen White speaks of a time “in the
     closing proclamation of the gospel” when “many of the Jews . . . will
     by faith receive Christ as their Redeemer.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts
     of the Apostles, p. 381.
        “There is a mighty work to be done in our world. The Lord has
     declared that the Gentiles shall be gathered in, and not the Gentiles
     only, but the Jews. There are among the Jews many who will be con-
     verted, and through whom we shall see the salvation of God go forth as
     a lamp that burneth. There are Jews everywhere, and to them the light
     of present truth is to be brought. There are among them many who will
     come to the light, and who will proclaim the immutability of the law of
     God with wonderful power.”—Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 578.

      Take some time to think about the Jewish roots of the Christian
      faith. How could a selective study of the Jewish religion help
      you better understand your Christian faith?

     The Salvation of Sinners
        Paul’s love for his own people is clearly apparent in these verses.
     How hard it must have been for him to have some of his countrymen
     fight against him and against the truth of the gospel. And yet, amid it
     all, he still believed that many would see Jesus as the Messiah.

Read Romans 11:28–36. How does Paul show God’s love, not just
     for the Jews but for all humanity? How does he here express the
     amazing and mysterious power of God’s grace?

       _____________________________________________________

       _____________________________________________________
       							
       All through these verses, though a contrast is made between Jews
     and Gentiles, one point stands clear: God’s mercy and love and grace
     are poured out upon sinners. From even before the foundation of the
     world, God’s plan was to save humanity and to use other human beings,
     nations even, as instruments in His hands to fulfill His divine will.

Read carefully and prayerfully verse 31. What important point
     should we take from this text about our witness, not just to Jews
     but to all people with whom we come in contact?

       _____________________________________________________

       No doubt, through the centuries, had the Christian church treated
     the Jews better, many more might have come to their Messiah. The
     great falling away in the early centuries after Christ, and the extreme
     paganization of Christianity—including the rejection of the seventh-
     day Sabbath in favor of Sunday—certainly didn’t make it any easier
     on a Jew who might have been drawn to Jesus.
       How crucial, then, that all Christians, realizing the mercy that has
     been given to them in Jesus, display that mercy to others. We can’t be
     Christians if we don’t (see Matt. 18:23–36).

      Is there someone to whom you need to show mercy, who per-
      haps doesn’t deserve it? Why not show this person that mercy,
      no matter how hard that might be? Isn’t that what Jesus has
      done for us?

         77–79; “From Persecutor to Disciple,” pp. 112–114; “Written
         From Rome,” pp. 474, 475, in The Acts of the Apostles; “Reaching

         Preach,” pp. 155, 156, in Selected Messages, book 1.
            		
            “Notwithstanding Israel’s failure as a nation, there remained among
         them a goodly remnant of such as should be saved. At the time of the
1
         Saviour’s advent there were faithful men and women who had received
         with gladness the message of John the Baptist, and had thus been led
         to study anew the prophecies concerning the Messiah. When the early
         Christian church was founded, it was composed of these faithful Jews
         who recognized Jesus of Nazareth as the one for whose advent they had
         been longing.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 376, 377.

            “Among the Jews are some who, like Saul of Tarsus, are mighty
         in the Scriptures, and these will proclaim with wonderful power the
         immutability of the law of God. . . . As His servants labor in faith for
         those who have long been neglected and despised, His salvation will
         be revealed.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 381.
            “In the closing proclamation of the gospel, when special work is
         to be done for classes of people hitherto neglected, God expects His
         messengers to take particular interest in the Jewish people whom
3
         they find in all parts of the earth. As the Old Testament Scriptures
         are blended with the New in an explanation of Jehovah’s eternal
         purpose, this will be to many of the Jews as the dawn of a new cre-
         ation, the resurrection of the soul. As they see the Christ of the gospel
         dispensation portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament Scriptures,
         and perceive how clearly the New Testament explains the Old, their
         slumbering faculties will be aroused, and they will recognize Christ
         as the Saviour of the world. Many will by faith receive Christ as their
         Redeemer.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 381.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 In the last days, as God’s law and especially the Sabbath
          come into sharp focus, is it not reasonable to think that the
          Jews—many of them as serious about the Ten Commandments
          as Adventists are—will have a role in helping to clarify some
          issues before the world? Discuss.

          l
          2 Why should, of all churches, the Adventist Church be the one
          most successful in reaching out to Jews? What can you or your local
          church do in seeking to reach Jews in your community, if any?

          l
          3 What can we learn from the mistakes of many in ancient
          Israel? How can we avoid doing the same things today?

Hearing God’s Voice
by Ericka Saunier
   I’ve often heard people testify that God had spoken to them, led them,
and guided them. I thought that I’d never heard the Holy Spirit’s voice and
wished I could have this experience.
   I preferred to help with the younger children’s Sabbath School rather
than attend my own. When I was in Primary, I helped in Cradle Roll.
When I was a teenager, we moved to another church, and I didn’t want to
go. My father insisted, so I asked the Cradle Roll teacher to let me help.
But she didn’t need help. However, the Primary class needed someone,
and I volunteered. I became a Primary class leader and eventually took the
job of director of children’s ministries.
   When I heard the pastor appeal for children to have their own small
groups, I couldn’t get his call out of my mind. When I told my mom this,
she said, “The Holy Spirit is talking to you.” Her comment shocked me.
Was I really hearing the Holy Spirit and didn’t even know it?
   I asked the conference children’s ministries leader how to start a chil-
dren’s small group. She told me what I needed, and I bought the material.
I asked two people to help me. One was a man who was not yet baptized.
I chose to work with children ages 4 to 11, and we decided to meet on
Wednesday evening while the adults were in prayer meeting.
   The small group was so successful that attendance at prayer meeting
increased when children begged their parents to go! The man who was
helping me was a teacher, so he helped teach the Bible story. Then the
children did the related activities in their workbooks. We had great fun,
and even some older children wanted to join the group.
   The program lasted a year, and then we started over again. The man who
helped me was baptized and now teaches an adult Sabbath School class.
                                 I now realize that the Holy Spirit was guid-
                              ing me all along. He asked me to use the gifts
                              He had given me—working with children. I
                              now understand that God asks us to do things
                              that we are naturally inclined to do, and usu-
                              ally it’s something we enjoy. I’m so glad God
                              has called me and can use me to lead others
                              to His feet.

                              grams such as the small group ministries of
                              the South American Division.

       Lesson            12 *September 11–17
     Love and Law




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 12, 13.

Memory Text: “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye trans-
     formed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what
     is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God” (Romans
     12:2).



     H
             owever much Paul was seeking to disabuse the Romans of
             their false notions of the law, he also calls all Christians to
             a high standard of obedience. This obedience comes from
     an inward change in our heart and mind, a change that comes only
     through the power of God working in a person surrendered to Him.
        Romans contains no hint that this obedience comes automatically. The
     Christian needs to be enlightened as to what the requirements are; he or
     she must desire to obey those requirements; and, finally, the Christian
     should seek the power without which that obedience is impossible.
        What this means is that works are part of the Christian faith. Paul
     never meant to depreciate works; in chapters 13 to 15 he gives them
     strong emphasis. This is no denial of what he has said earlier about
     righteousness by faith. On the contrary, works are the true expression
     of what it means to live by faith. One could even argue that because of
     the added revelation after Jesus came, the New Testament requirements
     are more difficult than what was required in the Old. New Testament
     believers have been given an example of proper moral behavior in Jesus
     Christ. He and no one else is the pattern we are to follow. “Let this mind
     be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:5).
        The standard doesn’t—can’t!—get higher than that.

     Living Sacrifices
        With chapter 11, the doctrinal part of the book of Romans ends.
     Chapters 12 through 16 present practical instruction and personal
     notes. Nevertheless, these concluding chapters are extremely impor-
     tant, because they show how the life of faith is to be lived.
        For starters, faith is not a substitute for obedience, as if faith some-
     how nullifies our obligation to obey the Lord. The moral precepts are
     still in force; they are explained, even amplified in the New Testament.
     And no indication is given, either, that it will be easy for the Christian to
     regulate his or her life by these moral precepts. On the contrary, we’re
     told that at times it could be difficult, for the battle with self and with sin
     is always hard (1 Pet. 4:1). Christians are promised divine power and
     given assurance that victory is possible, but we are still in the world of
     the enemy and will have to fight many battles against temptation. The
     good news is that if we fall, if we stumble, we are not cast away but
     have a High Priest who intercedes in our behalf (Heb. 7:25).

Read Romans 12:1. How does the analogy presented here reveal how we
     as Christians are to live? How does Romans 12:2 fit in with this?

       _____________________________________________________

       _____________________________________________________

        In Romans 12:1, Paul is alluding to Old Testament sacrifices. As,
     anciently, animals were sacrificed to God, so now Christians ought
     to yield their bodies to God, not to be killed but as living sacrifices
     dedicated to His service.
        In the time of ancient Israel, every offering brought as a sacrifice
     was examined carefully. If any defect was discovered in the animal,
     it was refused, for God had commanded that the offering be without
     blemish. So, Christians are bidden to present their bodies “a living
     sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” In order to do this, all their
     powers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Though none
     of us are without blemish, the point is that we are to seek to live as
     spotlessly and as faithfully as we can.

      It’s always so easy to come up with excuses for our sins and
      faults, isn’t it? What’s your common excuse for falling into the
      same thing again and again? Isn’t it about time to start putting
      away the excuses and claim the promises, for isn’t God’s power
      greater than your excuses?

     Thinking of Oneself
       We have talked a great deal this quarter about the perpetuity of God’s
     moral law and have stressed again and again that Paul’s message in
     the book of Romans is not one that teaches the Ten Commandments
     are done away with or somehow made void by faith.
       Yet, it’s easy to get so caught up in the letter of the law that we for-
     get the spirit behind it, and that spirit is love—love for God and love
     for one another. While anyone can profess love, revealing that love in
     everyday life can be a different matter entirely.

Read Romans 12:3–21. How are we to reveal love for others? 		

       _____________________________________________________

       _____________________________________________________
       							
       _____________________________________________________

       As in 1 Corinthians 12 and 13, after dealing with the gifts of the
     Spirit, Paul exalts love. Love (Greek agape) is the more excellent
     way. “God is love” (1 John 4:8). Therefore, love describes the char-
     acter of God. To love is to act toward others as God acts and to treat
     them as God treats them.
       Paul here shows how that love is to be expressed in a practical
     manner. One important principle comes through, and that is personal
     humility, a willingness of a person “not to think of himself more
     highly than he ought” (Rom. 12:3), a willingness to “give preference
     to one another in honor” (vs. 10, NASB), and a willingness not to
     “be wise in your own opinion” (vs. 16, NKJV). Christ’s words about
     Himself, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
     and lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:29), catch the essence of it.
       Of all people, Christians should be the most humble. After all,
     look at how helpless we are, look at how fallen we are; look at how
     dependent we are, not only upon a righteousness outside of ourselves
     for salvation but on a power working in us in order to change us in
     ways we never can change ourselves. What have we to brag of, what
     have we to boast of, what have we in and of ourselves to be proud
     about? Nothing at all. Working from the starting point of this personal
     humility, not only before God but before others, we are to live as Paul
     admonishes us to in these verses.

      Read Romans 12:18. How well are you applying this admoni-
      tion in your own life right now? Might you need some attitude
      adjustments in order to do what the Word tells us here?

Relationship to Government
Read Romans 13:1–7. What basic principles can we take from
these verses about how we are to relate to the civil power of gov-
ernment?
  _____________________________________________________

  _____________________________________________________
  							
  _____________________________________________________

   What makes Paul’s words so interesting is that he wrote during a
time when a pagan empire ruled the world, one that could be incredi-
bly brutal, one that was at its core corrupt, and one that knew nothing
about the true God and would, within a few years, start a massive
persecution of those who wanted to worship that God. In fact, Paul
was put to death by this government! Yet, despite all this, Paul was
advocating that Christians be good citizens, even under a government
like that?
   Yes. And that’s because the idea of government itself is found
throughout the Bible. The concept, the principle of government, is
God-ordained. Human beings need to live in a community with rules
and regulations and standards. Anarchy is not a biblical concept.
   That being said, it doesn’t mean that God approves of all forms of
government or how these governments are run. On the contrary. One
doesn’t have to look too far, either in history or in the world today, to
see some brutal regimes. Yet, even in situations like these, Christians
should, as much as possible, obey the laws of the land. Christians
are to give loyal support to government so long as its claims do not
conflict with the claims of God. One should consider very prayerfully
and carefully, and with the counsel of others, before embarking on a
path that puts him or her in conflict with the powers that be. We know
from prophecy that one day all of God’s faithful followers will be
pitted against the political powers in control of the world (Revelation
13). Until then, we should do all that we can, before God, to be good
citizens of whatever country in which we live.
   “We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine
appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its
legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of God,
we must obey God rather than men. God’s word must be recognized
as above all human legislation. . . .
   “We are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether spoken
or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place ourselves on
record as uttering that which would make us appear antagonistic to law
and order. We are not to say or do anything that would unnecessarily
close up our way.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 69.
                                                                     99

      Relationships to Others
        “Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
      loveth another hath fulfilled the law” (Rom. 13:8). How are we
      to understand this text? Does it mean that if we love, we have no
      obligation, then, to obey the law of God?

         _____________________________________________________
         							
         As Jesus did in the Sermon on the Mount, Paul here amplifies the
      precepts of the law, showing that love must be the motivating power
      behind all that we do. Because the law is a transcript of the character
      of God, and God is love, to love, therefore, is to fulfill the law. Yet,
      Paul is not substituting some vague standard of love for the precisely
      detailed precepts of the law, as some Christians claim. The moral law
      is still binding, because, again, it is what points out sin—and who is
      going to deny the reality of sin? However, the law truly can be kept
      only in the context of love. Remember, some of those who brought
      Christ to the cross then ran home to keep the law!

Which commandments did Paul cite as samples to illustrate the princi-
      ple of love in law-keeping? Why these in particular? Rom. 13:9, 10.

        _____________________________________________________
        							
        Interestingly, the factor of love was not a newly introduced principle.
      By quoting Leviticus 19:18, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,”
      Paul showed that the principle was an integral part of the Old Testament
      system. Again Paul appealed to the Old Testament to support his gospel
      preaching. Some argue from these texts that Paul is teaching that only
      the few commandments mentioned here are in effect. If so, does this
      mean, then, that Christians can dishonor their parents, worship idols,
      and have other gods before the Lord? Of course not.
        Look at the context here. Paul was dealing with how we relate to
      one another. He was dealing with personal relationships, which is why
      he specified the commandments that centered on these relationships.
      His argument certainly shouldn’t be construed as nullifying the rest of
      the law. (See Acts 15:20, 1 Thess. 1:9, 1 John 5:21.) Besides, as the
      New Testament writers point out, by showing love to others, we show
      our love to God (Matt. 25:40; 1 John 4:20, 21).

       Think about your relationship to God and how it is reflected in
       your relationships with others. How big a factor is love in those
       relationships? How can you learn to love others the way God
       loves us? What stands in your way of doing just that?

     Nearer Than We Believed
       “And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
     out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we
     believed” (Rom. 13:11).

        As we have stated all quarter, Paul had a very specific focus in this
     letter to the Romans, and that was to clarify for the church at Rome,
     especially the Jewish believers there, the role of faith and works in
     the New Covenant context. The issue was salvation and how a sinner
     is deemed righteous and holy before the Lord. To help those whose
     whole emphasis had been on law, Paul put the law in its proper role and
     context. Though, ideally, Judaism even in Old Testament times was a
     religion of grace, legalism arose and did a lot of damage. How careful
     we as a church need to be that we don’t make the same mistake.

Read Romans 13:11–14. What event is Paul talking about here, and
     how should we be acting in anticipation of that event?

       _____________________________________________________
       							
       _____________________________________________________

        How fascinating that Paul here was talking to the believers, telling
     them to wake up and get it together because Jesus was coming back. The
     fact that this was written almost two thousand years ago doesn’t matter.
     We must always live in anticipation of the nearness of Christ’s coming.
     As far as we all are concerned, as far as our own personal experiences go,
     the Second Coming is as near as the potential for our own death. Whether
     next week or in 40 years, we close our eyes in death, and whether we
     sleep only 4 days or for 400 years—it makes no difference to us. The
     next thing we know is the second coming of Jesus. With death always
     potentially just around the corner for any of us, time is indeed short, and
     our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
        Though Paul doesn’t deal much in the book of Romans with the
     Second Coming, in the Thessalonian and the Corinthian letters he
     covers it in much more detail. After all, it’s a crucial theme in the
     Bible, especially the New Testament. Without it, and the hope it
     offers, our faith is, really, meaningless. After all, what does “justifica-
     tion by faith” mean without the Second Coming to bring that wonder-
     ful truth to complete fruition?

      If you knew for certain that Jesus was coming next month, what
      would you change in your life, and why? Now, if you believe you
      need to change these things a month before Jesus comes, why
      shouldn’t you change them now? What is the difference?
                                                                           101

             “In the Bible the will of God is revealed. The truths of the Word of
          God are the utterances of the Most High. He who makes these truths a
1         part of his life becomes in every sense a new creature. He is not given
          new mental powers, but the darkness that through ignorance and sin
          has clouded the understanding is removed. The words, ‘A new heart
          also will I give you,’ mean, ‘A new mind will I give you.’ A change
          of heart is always attended by a clear conviction of Christian duty, an
          understanding of truth. He who gives the Scriptures close, prayerful
2         attention will gain clear comprehension and sound judgment, as if in
          turning to God he had reached a higher plane of intelligence.”—Ellen G.
          White, My Life Today, p. 24.
             “The Lord . . . is soon coming, and we must be ready and waiting
          for His appearing. Oh, how glorious it will be to see Him and be wel-
          comed as His redeemed ones! Long have we waited, but our hope is
          not to grow dim. If we can but see the King in His beauty we shall be
          forever blessed. I feel as if I must cry aloud: ‘Homeward bound!’ We
3         are nearing the time when Christ will come in power and great glory
          to take His ransomed ones to their eternal home.”—Ellen G. White,
          Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 253.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 In class, go over the question at the end of Thursday’s lesson.
           What were the answers folk gave, and how did they justify them?

           l
           2 The question of how we are to be good citizens and good
           Christians can at times be very complicated. If someone were to
           come to you seeking advice about standing for what he or she
           believed was God’s will, even though it would put him or her in
           conflict with the government, what would you say? What coun-
           sel would you give? What principles should you follow? Why is
           this something that we should proceed on only with the utmost
           seriousness and prayerful consideration? (After all, not everyone
           thrown into the lions’ den comes out unscathed.)

           l
           3 What do you think is harder to do: to keep strict adherence
           to the letter of the law or to love God and love others uncondi-
           tionally? Or, could you argue that this question presents a false
           dichotomy? If so, why?

The Enthusiastic Converts
by G. Devadass
   When a group of believers wanted to start a new church plant in a sub-
urb of Chennai (formerly Madras), India, several church members paired
up into twos and went visiting from house to house in that neighborhood.
During our visiting, we met Elkana and Jeba-Kumari.
   Elkana and his wife were devoted Christians and active members of
a charismatic church. They operated a hostel (home) for poor children,
supported by donations from other believers. But they were willing to
listen as we read from the Bible and explained the fundamental beliefs of
Adventists.
   We visited with Elkana and Jeba-Kumari every week, and they began
attending the Adventist church. In time they were baptized into the
Adventist family of believers.
   This dedicated couple told their family members of their decision to
become Seventh-day Adventists. They shared what they were learning
from the Bible that they hadn’t known before, and some of their relatives
began attending church with them.
   The pastor invited Elkana and his wife to share their faith in their own
part of town, and they agreed. For six months the pastor trained them how
to share God’s word and urged them to invite people to the church. Then
they went out on their own.
   Elkana and Jeba-Kumari took up their new commission with energy,
and within 10 months 28 more people from the neighborhood were attend-
ing the Adventist church. This group of new believers formed the core of
a new congregation that now numbers more than 30 people. They have no
church in which to worship and must meet in a rented room.
   Jeba-Kumari is an especially gifted soul winner, and the couple contin-
                           ues to share their faith with those they meet.
                           They hope to find land and build a church for
                           their little congregation soon, knowing that
                           when they do, their membership will grow.
                             Meanwhile, the members of the original
                           church who first visited Elkana’s neighborhood
                           have moved on to a new community to claim
                           more souls for Christ. In this way the work in
                           the great city of Chennai is flourishing.


                              G. Devadass (center, with Jeba-Kumari and Elkana) is a
                              pastor in Chennai (Madras), India.

      All the Rest Is
      Commentary


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Romans 14–16.

Memory Text: “Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost
      thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the
      judgment seat of Christ” (Romans 14:10).



      S
            omeone approached a famous rabbi of antiquity and asked
            him to explain the whole meaning of the Torah while standing
            on one leg. “Do not do to another,” the rabbi said on one leg,
      “what seems to you to be hurtful; that is the whole Torah. All the rest
      is commentary.”
         Whether or not one agrees with the rabbi’s statement, he does
      have a point. Some aspects of our faith are foundational and others
      mere “commentary.” This week’s lesson looks at some of that “com-
      mentary.” What this means is that all that came before focused very
      much on the foundational principles of salvation. What is the role
      of the law—be it the whole Old Testament system or just the Ten
      Commandments—in the area of salvation? Paul needed to define
      clearly what are the grounds upon which God accepts a person.
      Perhaps the whole thing could be summarized by the pagan jailer’s
      question, “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).
         With that explained, Paul now engages in some “commentary.”
      Though very strong on some points, Paul takes a much freer attitude
      regarding other things. That’s because these things are nonessentials,
      “commentary,” as it were. Yet, at the same time, though the issues
      themselves might not have been crucial, the attitude the Christians
      had toward each other in dealing with these issues was.

      The Weak Brother
     In Romans 14:1–3, the question was the eating of meats that may
   have been sacrificed to idols. The Jerusalem council (Acts 15) ruled
   that Gentile converts should refrain from using such foods in their
   diet. But there was always the question as to whether meats sold in
   public markets had come from animals sacrificed to idols (see 1 Cor.
   10:25). Some Christians didn’t care about that at all; others, if there
   were the slightest doubt, chose to eat vegetables instead. The issue
   had nothing to do with the question of vegetarianism and healthful liv-
   ing. Nor is Paul implying in this passage that the distinction between
   clean and unclean meats has been abolished. This is not the subject
   under consideration. If the words “he may eat all things” (Rom. 14:2)
   were taken to mean that now any animal, clean or otherwise, could
   be eaten, they would be misapplied. Comparison with other New
   Testament passages would rule against such an application.
     Meanwhile, to “receive” one weak in the faith meant to accord him
   or her full membership and social status. The person was not to be
   argued with but given the right to his or her opinion.
     					
What principle should we take, then, from Romans 14:1–3?
        _____________________________________________________
        							
        _____________________________________________________

         It’s important, too, to realize that Paul in verse 3 does not speak nega-
      tively of the one “weak in the faith.” Nor does he give this person advice
      as to how to become strong. So far as God is concerned, the overscrupu-
      lous Christian (judged overscrupulous, apparently, not by God but by his
      or her fellow Christians) is accepted. “God hath received him.”

How does Romans 14:4 amplify what we’ve just looked at?

        _____________________________________________________

       Though we need to keep in mind the principles seen in today’s
       lesson, are there not times and places where we need to step in
       and judge, if not a person’s heart, at least the actions? Are we
       to step back and say and do nothing in every situation? Isaiah
       56:10 describes watchmen as “dumb dogs, they cannot bark.”
       How can we know when to speak and when to keep silent? How
       do we strike the right balance here?

      With What Measure You Mete
Read Romans 14:10. What reason does Paul give here for us to be
      careful about how we judge others?

      _______________________________________________________

         We tend to judge others harshly at times, and often for the same
      things that we ourselves do. How often, though, what we do doesn’t
      seem as bad to us as when others do the same thing. We might fool
      ourselves by our hypocrisy, but not God, who warned us: “Judge not,
      that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
      judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
      again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
      considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say
      to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a
      beam is in thine own eye?” (Matt. 7:1–4).

Of what significance is the statement from the Old Testament that Paul
      introduced here? Rom. 14:11.


        The citation from Isaiah 45:23 supports the thought that all must
      appear for judgment. “Every knee” and “every tongue” individualizes
      the summons. The implication is that each one will have to answer for
      his or her own life and deeds (vs. 12). No one can answer for another.
      In this important sense, we are not our brother’s keeper.

Keeping the context in mind, how do you understand what Paul is
      saying in Romans 14:14?


         The subject is still foods sacrificed to idols. The issue is, clearly, not
      the distinction between the foods deemed clean and unclean. Paul is
      saying that there is nothing wrong per se in eating foods that might have
      been offered to idols. After all, what is an idol anyway? It is nothing
      (see 1 Cor. 8:4), so who cares if some pagan offered the food to a statue
      of a frog or a bull?
         A person should not be made to violate his or her conscience, even
      if the conscience is overly sensitive. This fact the “strong” brethren
      apparently did not understand. They despised the scrupulosity of the
      “weak” brethren and put stumbling blocks in their way.

       Might you, in your zeal for the Lord, be in danger of what Paul
       is warning about here? Why must we be careful not to seek to be
       the conscience of others, no matter how good our intentions?

     Giving No Offense
Read Romans 14:15–23 (see also 1 Cor. 8:12, 13). Summarize on the
     lines below the gist of what Paul is saying. What principle can we
     take from this passage that we can apply in all areas of our lives?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In verses 17–20 Paul is putting various aspects of Christianity into
     proper perspective. Although diet is important, Christians ought not to
     quarrel over the choice on the part of some to eat vegetables instead
     of flesh meats that might have been sacrificed to idols. Instead, they
     ought to focus on righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
     How might we apply this idea to questions of diet today in our
     church? However much the health message, and especially the teach-
     ings on diet, can be a blessing to us, not everyone sees this subject the
     same way, and we need to respect those differences.

       In verse 22, amid all this talk about leaving people to their own
     conscience, Paul adds a very interesting caveat: “Blessed is the
     man who does not condemn himself by what he approves” (NIV).
     What warning is Paul giving here? How does this balance out the
     rest of what he is saying in this context?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Have you heard someone say, “It is none of anyone’s business what
     I eat or what I wear or what kind of entertainment I engage in”? Is it
     really? None of us lives in a vacuum. Our actions, words, deeds, and
     even diet can affect others, either for good or for bad. It’s not hard to
     see how. If someone who looks up to you sees you doing something
     “wrong,” he or she could be influenced by your example to do that
     same thing. We fool ourselves if we think otherwise. To argue that,
     well, you didn’t force the person is beside the point. As Christians,
     we have a responsibility to one another, and if our example can lead
     someone astray, we are culpable.

      What kind of example do you present? Would you feel com-
      fortable with having others, particularly young people or new
      believers, following your example in all areas? What does your
      answer say about you?
                                                                         107

      Observance of Days
        In this discussion about not judging others who might view some
      things differently than we do, and not being a stumbling block to oth-
      ers who might be offended by our actions, Paul brings up the issue of
      special days that some want to observe and others don’t.

Read Romans 14:4–10. How are we to understand what Paul is say-
      ing here? Does this say anything about the fourth commandment?
      If not, why not?

        ____________________________________________________

         About what days is Paul speaking? Was there a controversy in the
      early church over the observance or nonobservance of certain days?
      Apparently so. We get a hint of such controversy in Galatians 4:9, 10,
      where Paul berates the Galatian Christians for observing “days, and
      months, and times, and years.” As we noted in lesson 2, some in the
      church had persuaded the Galatian Christians to be circumcised and to
      keep other precepts of the law of Moses. Paul feared that these ideas
      might harm the Roman church, as well. But perhaps in Rome it was
      particularly the Jewish Christians who had a hard time persuading
      themselves that they need no longer observe the Jewish festivals. Paul
      here is saying, Do as you please in this matter; the important point is
      not to judge those who view the matter differently from you. Some
      Christians, apparently, to be on the safe side, decided to observe one
      or more of the Jewish festivals. Paul’s counsel is, Let them do it, if
      they are persuaded they should.
         To bring the weekly Sabbath into Romans 14:5, as some argue, is
      unwarranted. Can one imagine Paul taking such a laid-back attitude
      toward the fourth commandment? As we have seen all quarter, Paul
      placed a heavy emphasis on obedience to the law, so he certainly wasn’t
      going to place the Sabbath commandment in the same category as folk
      who are uptight about eating foods that might have been offered to
      idols. However commonly these texts are used as an example to show
      that the seventh-day Sabbath is no longer binding, they say no such
      thing. Their use in that manner is a prime example of what Peter warned
      that people were doing with Paul’s writings: “As also in all his epistles,
      speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be
      understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they
      do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction” (2 Pet. 3:16).

       What has been your experience with the Sabbath? Has it been
       the blessing it was meant to be? What changes can you make
       in order to experience more fully what the Lord offers you in
       the Sabbath?

      Fitting Benediction
Read Romans 15:1–3. What important Christian truth is found in
      these texts?

In what way do these texts capture so much of what it means to be a
      follower of Jesus?

What other verses teach the same idea? Most important, how can you,
      yourself, live out this principle?

As Paul brought his letter to a close, what varied benedictions did he
      utter? Rom. 15:5, 6, 13, 33.

         The God of patience means the God who helps His children to
      endure steadfastly. The word for “patience,” hupomone, means “for-
      titude,” “steadfast endurance.” The word for “consolation” may be
      translated “encouragement.” The God of encouragement is the God
      who encourages. The God of hope is the God who has given hope to
      humankind. Likewise, the God of peace is the God who gives peace
      and in whom one may have peace.
         What a fitting benediction in a letter whose dominant theme is
      righteousness by faith—encouragement, hope, peace! How sorely our
      present world needs these.

After numerous personal greetings, how did Paul bring his letter to
      a close? Rom. 16:25–27.

         Paul ends his letter in a glorious ascription of praise to God. God is
      the one in whom the Roman Christians, and all Christians, can safely
      put their trust to confirm their standing as redeemed sons and daugh-
      ters of God, justified by faith and now led by the Spirit of God.
         Paul is thrilled to be the herald of such glorious news. He calls this
      news “my gospel.” What he means is the gospel he proclaims. But
      what he preaches has been confirmed by the preaching of Jesus and
      by the messages of the prophets. It was kept secret, not because God
      did not want humanity to know, but because people refused light from
      heaven, preventing God from giving them further light. Moreover,
      there were some aspects of the plan that people would be unable to
      grasp until the Messiah came in human flesh. He gave a demonstra-
      tion, not only of what God is like but also of what humanity may
      become by laying hold of divine power. The new kind of life would
      be one of “obedience of faith”; that is, obedience springing from faith
      in the Lord, who through grace justifies sinners by the righteousness
      given to all who claim it for themselves.
                                                                          109

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Unity and Love in the Church,”
          pp. 477, 478; “Love for the Erring,” pp. 604–606, in Testimonies for
          the Church, vol. 5; “Helping the Tempted,” p. 166, in The Ministry of
          Healing; p. 719, in The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6.

             “I was shown the danger of the people of God in looking to Brother
          and Sister White and thinking that they must come to them with their
          burdens and seek counsel of them. This ought not so to be. They are
1         invited by their compassionate, loving Saviour to come unto Him, when
          weary and heavy-laden, and He will relieve them. . . . Many come to us
          with the inquiry: Shall I do this? Shall I engage in that enterprise? Or,
          in regard to dress, Shall I wear this or that article? I answer them: You
          profess to be disciples of Christ. Study your Bibles. Read carefully and
          prayerfully the life of our dear Saviour when He dwelt among men upon
2         the earth. Imitate His life, and you will not be found straying from the
          narrow path. We utterly refuse to be conscience for you. If we tell you
          just what to do, you will look to us to guide you, instead of going directly
          to Jesus for yourselves.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
          vol. 2, pp. 118, 119.
             “We are not to place the responsibility of our duty upon others, and
          wait for them to tell us what to do. We cannot depend for counsel upon
          humanity. The Lord will teach us our duty just as willingly as He will
3         teach somebody else. . . . Those who decide to do nothing in any line that
          will displease God, will know, after presenting their case before Him, just
          what course to pursue.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 668.
             “There have ever been in the church those who are constantly inclined
          toward individual independence. They seem unable to realize that inde-
          pendence of spirit is liable to lead the human agent to have too much con-
          fidence in himself and to trust in his own judgment rather than to respect
          the counsel and highly esteem the judgment of his brethren.”—Ellen G.
          White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 163, 164.

    Discussion Questions:
           Given some of the themes of this week, how do we as Christians
           find the right balance in the following cases:
           l
           1 Being faithful to what we believe, yet not judging others who
           see things differently from the way we do?
           l
           2 Being true to our own conscience and not seeking to be the
           conscience for others, while at the same time seeking to help
           those whom we believe are in error? When do we speak, and
           when do we keep silent? When are we culpable if we do keep
           silent?
           l3 Being free in the Lord and yet at the same time realizing our
           responsibility to be a good example for those who might look up

Reunited in Christ
by Kristina Muelhauser
  Juma was just a boy when war separated Juma from his family. His
mother had traveled to their grandparents’ home with her children while
their father remained in Juba, Sudan. During the war Juba was captured
by the military, and Juma’s family couldn’t return home. Juma grew up
not knowing his father.
  But finally peace has come to southern Sudan, and families are reunit-
ing. Meanwhile the city is struggling to rebuild.
  It’s a time of spiritual rebuilding as well. Recently Seventh-day Adventist
pastors, evangelists, and Bible workers from Sudan, the Middle East
Union, and the Trans-European Division held city-wide evangelistic
meetings to share God’s love with the people of Juba.
  The truck carrying the evangelists, pastors, and lay evangelists bounced
along the dirt road toward Juba. Its wheels stirred up huge clouds of gray-
brown dust that settled on everything and everyone nearby. The truck
lumbered to a stop in a rubbish-filled open area near the city that would
be the site of one of the evangelistic meetings. The evangelists would have
to clear the rubbish before they could set up the tent to hold the meetings.
Then they would visit the people and invite them to attend.
  And the people would come. They are thirsty—not just for physical
water, but for the Water of Life the team had come to bring them.
  The teams braved heat, dust, and flies as they shared God’s love with
the people of Juba. When the meetings began and singing filled the air,
the people came. They listened to health talks, heard children’s stories,
and learned of God’s love.
  The devil tried to destroy the meetings. When high winds blew up just
as the pastors began to speak, church members grabbed the tent poles
to prevent the tent from blowing away. The wind died down, and rain
poured from the sky, although it was the dry season. In another location
the tent was almost empty when the meeting was scheduled to start. But
the sudden rain sent people to the tent for shelter, and a full house heard
the message that night.
  So far 45 have been baptized in Juba, including Juma’s father. Many
more are preparing to join the family of God in this region that has been
cut off from the gospel and from the outside world. Please pray for the
people of southern Sudan as they seek to reconnect with their families and
learn to love their Savior. And praise God for the mission offerings that
helped make the Juba evangelism possible.

Field.

2010    Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter
          History—both secular and sacred—is often told through stories.
       Next quarter’s Bible study guide, Background Characters in the
       Old Testament, by Gerald and Chantal Klingbeil, looks at some
       of the overlooked and forgotten figures in the Old Testament. The
       lives of these characters might not seem so important, a feeling
       most of us can identify with. As we study them, let us remember the
       power of our own lives and examples. Our stories can become pow-
       erful tools in our witness to others about what God has done for us.
       As with these background characters, we become part of the great
       story of salvation, even if we might not be the main characters in
       the grander scheme of the cosmic drama that unfolds around us.
Lesson 1—Story and History
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: People and Plots (Job 1:1–12)
       Monday: Where and How? (1 Sam. 24:1–6, Gen. 39:6–12)
       Tuesday: From Victory to the “Dark Ages” (Josh. 3:9–17)
       Wednesday: Of Kings and Princes (1 Sam. 8:3–20)
       Thursday: Rehoboam’s Folly (1 Kings 12:1–16)
       Memory Text—2                Timothy 3:16
       Sabbath Gem: The Bible is so contemporary because it is full
       of stories. Not legends, not “cleverly devised myths” (2 Pet. 1:16,
       ESV), but historical and personal stories that reveal truth about God
       and His interaction with fallen humanity. These stories describe
       real people, battling with real-life problems and interacting with the
       living God, who offers answers to these problems.

Lesson 2—Caleb: Living With the Wait
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: “The Facts” (Num. 13:26–14:2)
       Monday: Standing Tall When It Counts (Num. 13:30)
       Tuesday: Claiming God’s Promises (Joshua 14)
       Wednesday: Passing on the Legacy (Ps. 92:12–15)
       Thursday: Giving Freely (Judg. 1:14, 15)
       Memory Text—Psalm                   130:6, 7
       Sabbath Gem:      Caleb exhibits strong courage and faith in God.
       He is a great leader who is willing to take risks and to lead by
       example. His story is relevant for us as we wait to cross over into
       the heavenly Canaan.
