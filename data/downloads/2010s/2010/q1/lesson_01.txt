         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of a worldwide evaluation committee and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

The Fruit of the Spirit Is . . .

A                  woman, driving her vehicle, was pulled over by a few squad cars,
                   and, when the police came out, they had their guns drawn. The
                   woman was shocked. What had she done?
   “You were weaving in and out of traffic,” one officer said, “making obscene ges-
tures to other drivers and cursing them.”
   “For that,” she replied, “you pull out your guns?”
   “Well,” the officer said, “we saw the bumper sticker, which said you were a
Christian, and we just assumed the car had been stolen.”
   This silly story brings out an important point: Christians, by their very profes-
sion, are held up to a high moral standard. After all, look at the One whom they
profess as their model, Jesus Christ.
   How, then, should Christians live? How should we act in public and at home?
The key is found in Galatians 5:22, 23, the subject of this quarter. “But the fruit
of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance: against such there is no law.”
   We are going to look at this “fruit of the Spirit”; that is, we are going to look at what
happens to those whose lives are surrendered to God and who thus allow the Holy
Spirit to work in them. “ ‘That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is
born of the Spirit is spirit’ ” (John 3:6, NKJV). The fruit of the Spirit is what grows in
us when we are born of the Spirit; it is what happens when we are born-again.
   Notice, Paul says that “the fruit of the Spirit is . . .” He’s talking in the singular.
Paul is not talking about separate traits that operate independently of one another
but about a single reality. The fruit of the Spirit is what the Holy Spirit creates
within us; it defines the type of person we are to become in Jesus.
   The fruit of the Spirit is like a precious jewel with many facets. Each facet is a
characteristic of Jesus and represents a quality that He wants to produce in our
lives. This is the heart of the matter. God’s purpose is to make us like Jesus, and
He has sent the Holy Spirit to dwell in us to make
that change happen.
   You will see as we study these lessons that the fruit            We can let the
of the Spirit is not a theory, though we have made                  Holy Spirit make
it a study. It is not a lifestyle, though a person who              us more like Jesus,
is cultivating the fruit of the Spirit will not live as
he or she did before. Instead, the fruit of the Spirit
                                                                    who is patience,
is a change of being. “Old things are passed away;                  love, gentleness,
behold, all things are become new” (2 Cor. 5:17).                   and faithfulness
The fruit of the Spirit is the “new” in the life of a               personified.
person who has passed from death unto life (1 John
3:14) in Christ.
   The purpose of this quarter’s lessons is not to focus on how we can become
more patient or more loving or more gentle or more faithful but on how we can
let the Holy Spirit make us more like Jesus, who is patience, love, gentleness,
and faithfulness personified.
   You will be challenged to cultivate the graces of the fruit of the Spirit at all
times, but especially at home. We will see that the key is surrender, a willingness
to die to self and live for God and for others. Finally, we will see that all that we
do, we must do under the realization that we are sinners in need of the covering
grace of Christ, who loves us whether the harvest seems plentiful or sparse. We
must never forget that the fruit of the Spirit is just that—the “fruit,” the result
of salvation, not the means. The means is always Jesus and what He has done
for us, which we claim by faith.

     “By Their Fruit . . .”




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 13:7–9, John 11:4,
     12:28, 15:1–10, 2 Tim. 3:5.

Memory Text: “ ‘Therefore by their fruits you will know them’ ”
     (Matthew 7:20, NKJV).



     O
              ne of the most thrilling promises of the Lord is that if we will
              abide in Him and allow Him to abide in us through His Spirit,
              we actually will be different. Our lives will be changed, even
     radically.
        “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have
     passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Cor. 5:17, NKJV).
        This quarter we will study various facets of the fruit of the Spirit. The
     wonderful plan of salvation assures us that “we all, with unveiled face,
     beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed
     into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the
     Lord” (2 Cor. 3:18, NKJV).
        Those who abide in Jesus always will bear fruit of the Spirit. Do you
     sometimes wonder if that promise really could be for you? The answer is
     a resounding Yes. We can be confident of this very thing, that He who has
     begun this good work in us will finish it (Phil. 1:6). Remember His words:
     “ ‘You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you
     should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever
     you ask the Father in My name He may give you’ ” (John 15:16, NKJV).
     And the best news yet is that the good work the Holy Spirit is doing in our
     lives is not just for now but for eternity.

     “ ‘Every Tree Is Known by Its Own Fruit’ ”
     (Luke 6:44, NKJV)
       		
       Has anyone ever asked you if you have received the Holy Spirit?
     Usually this is a way of discovering whether you speak in “tongues.”
     For them, tongues-speaking is the determining factor for whether or
     not you demonstrate the indwelling of the Spirit. Jesus, though, warns
     us about looking at certain outward signs and miracles as proof of
     anything. Read His clear warning in Matthew 7:21–23 (see also Rev.
     16:14). Jesus says plainly that undeniable miracles will be performed
     in Jesus’ name, but that does not prove that these people are His faith-
     ful followers.
       In fact, we are told that in the last days professed followers of
     Jesus would have a form of godliness but would deny the power
     thereof (2 Tim. 3:5).

Read 2 Timothy 3:5. How do we see this truth manifested today?

       “ ‘For a good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear
     good fruit. For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not
     gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble
     bush’ ” (Luke 6:43, 44, NKJV).
       Jesus said we can know a tree by the fruit it produces. A person
     reveals himself or herself not so much by what he or she professes but
     by what he or she is. The gifts of the Spirit are given to the church for
     ministry. The fruit of the Spirit is given to the child of God so that his
     or her life might be changed.
       Being a true Christian and bearing good fruit place the emphasis on
     being. A good actor can play the part of Mahatma Gandhi, but he can
     never be Mahatma Gandhi. We can look good, sound good, and even
     appear to do good. But unless the Holy Spirit gives us a new heart, we
     never can be good.

      Dwell more on this distinction between doing good and being good.
      First, what do we mean by “good”? Second, can a person do good
      and not be good? Or, can a person be good and not do good? Work
      through your answers and bring them to class on Sabbath.
                                                                             7

     “ ‘Without Me You Can Do Nothing’ ”
     (John 15:5, NKJV)

       Two young boys were using a fruit tree to climb out of their second-
     story bedroom window and go to the swimming hole without their
     parents’ permission. One day they heard their father say he was going
     to cut the tree down because it was dead. Fearing they would lose
     their escape route, they went to the store and bought artificial apples,
     which they tied to the branches of the dead tree. The next morning
     their father expressed amazement that apples seemed to have grown
     overnight, especially since the tree was a pear tree!

Read John 15:1–5 and answer the following questions:

      Jesus declared Himself to be the True Vine. Why do you think
     He emphasized “true” vine? (See also Matt. 24:24.)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       According to John 15:5, what does Jesus say we are? What does
     that mean on a practical level; that is, what does it tell us about
     how we should live?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Verse 4 explains that a branch cannot bear fruit unless it is connected
     to the vine. This is a crucial point, one that we should not miss.
       Picture a branch that has fallen off an apple tree. Suppose that
     branch had several apples just reaching maturity. What soon happens
     to the branch? To the apples? Would it make any difference if we
     painted the apples a deep red? Suppose we watered the branch or put
     fertilizer on the ground around it? Would the branch continue to bear
     more apples if we stuck the stem into the ground? Why, then, is being
     connected to the trunk (the vine) essential to the branch?

      How do you abide in Jesus? What does that mean? What would
      you have to change in your life to make this a daily experience?
      What practices and habits are you cultivating that make it more
      difficult to abide in Him?

     “ ‘By This My Father Is Glorified’ ”
     (John 15:8, NKJV)

       “ ‘By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so
     you will be My disciples’ ” (John 15:8, NKJV). What does this text
     mean?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       You have no doubt heard the saying, “It is possible to do the right
     thing for the wrong reason.” If this is true, is it possible to attempt to
     abide in Jesus for the wrong reason? Abiding in Jesus is not a means
     to an end; rather, it is an end in itself. The result of abiding in Him
     will be that we bear fruit, not to glorify ourselves but to glorify God.
     In other words, the fruit of the Spirit is not to make us look good but
     to make the Father look good.

Christ’s ministry, which included many miracles and good works,
     had a definite driving force. What was that force, and how should
     this idea influence what our motives should be? (John 11:4,
     12:28).

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Perhaps your church is looking for ways to do things in the commu-
     nity that will enhance the image of the church. And that’s good. At the
     same time, we need to be careful about what our motives and purposes
     are. What’s our ultimate goal in these endeavors? Is it to glorify self or
     to glorify God? How can we learn to make a distinction between the
     two? In many ways, it can be easy to mix these things, covering even
     the most self-aggrandizing actions under the false veneer of “glorify-
     ing” God.

      Read Matthew 5:16 and 1 Corinthians 10:31. How can we create
      good will and give the glory to our Father in heaven at the same
      time? Bear in mind that it is possible to create good will and
      leave the Father out, taking the credit for ourselves. Examine
      your own heart and ask yourself what really motivates some of
      your actions. How might you be fooling yourself?
                                                                             9

     “ ‘That It May Bear More Fruit’ ”
     (John 15:2, NKJV)

       “ ‘Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away;
     and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear
     more fruit’ ” (John 15:2, NKJV). What is this pruning process all
     about? How have you experienced it yourself? When that specific
     process ended, in what ways were you different from before it
     began?

        At the end of every season, the farmer goes back into the vineyard
     and prunes away most of the vine. The farmer must be careful, how-
     ever, because next year’s crop is directly dependent on which parts
     remain. The key to pruning is the balance between the crop and vine.
     One is grown at the expense of the other. If you overcrop by not cut-
     ting enough away, the following year’s growth will be weak and the
     fruit inferior. The skillful art is to find the right balance.
        “God brings men into trying places to see if they will trust in a
     power out of and above themselves. He sees not as man sees. He often
     has to break up human connections and change the order which man
     has mapped out, which is perfect in his estimation. What man thinks
     is for his spiritual and temporal interests may be altogether at variance
     with the experience he must have in order to be a follower of Christ.
     His idea of his own value may be far out of the way.
        “Tests are placed all along the way from earth to heaven. It is
     because of this that the road to heaven is called the narrow way.
     Character must be tested, else there would be many spurious
     Christians who would keep up a fair semblance of religion until
     their inclinations, their desire to have their own way, their pride and
     ambition, were crossed. When by the Lord’s permission sharp trials
     come to them, their lack of genuine religion, of the meekness and
     lowliness of Christ, shows them to be in need of the work of the Holy
     Spirit.”—Ellen G. White, In Heavenly Places, p. 266.

      Have you ever had a trial that severely tested your faith, even
      to the point where you wondered if you really even had faith?
      Looking back, what lessons should you have learned from that
      experience? Most important, did you learn them?

      “ ‘ “And If It Bears Fruit, Well. But If
      Not . . .” ’ ” (Luke 13:9, NKJV)
         Between 1730 and 1745 the American colonies from Maine
      to Georgia experienced a religious revival known as the Great
      Awakening. Jonathan Edwards was a leader in this movement of spir-
      itual renewal. In July of 1741 he preached a sermon entitled “Sinners
      in the Hands of an Angry God,” which for some has become a sym-
      bol of the bleak, cruel, and hell-bent outlook of many Christians.
      However polemical, this sermon did express the truth about the awful
      weight of sin, the attitude of an infinitely holy God toward sin, and
      the surety of a day of judgment.

Read John 15:1–10. What balance does Jesus present here in the
      context of bearing fruit?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Notice how, on one hand, He said that if we would abide in Him
      we would bear much fruit, which is a product of being saved by Him.
      That is, if we abide in Him, by faith, we are assured of salvation
      because of His righteousness, which is credited to us. At the same
      time, He warns that if we do not abide in Him we will not bear fruit,
      and those who do not bear fruit will wither and at last be cast into the
      fire to be burned (see 2 Pet. 3:9).

What is the lesson to be learned from the parable Jesus told in Luke
      13:7–9?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       The point here is not salvation by bearing fruit, which would be
       just another manifestation of salvation by works. We’re not saved by
       bearing fruit; our fruit reveals the reality of the salvation we already
       have in Jesus, through faith in Him. Bearing fruit is an expression of
       salvation; it is not a means to attaining it. It is crucial that we under-
       stand this distinction. If not, we are sooner or later going to either
       become proud of what we deem our wonderful fruit, or we’re going
       to give up in despair at what seems to be a very paltry crop.

                                                                              11

    Further Study: “ ‘By their fruits ye shall know them’ (Matthew
         7:20), the Saviour declared. All the true followers of Christ bear fruit
         to His glory. Their lives testify that a good work has been wrought in
         them by the Spirit of God, and their fruit is unto holiness. Their lives
         are elevated and pure. Right actions are the unmistakable fruit of true
         godliness, and those who bear no fruit of this kind reveal that they
         have no experience in the things of God. They are not in the Vine.
         Said Jesus, ‘Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
         of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
         in Me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in Me, and
         I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can
1        do nothing.’ John 15:4, 5.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels to Parents,
         Teachers, and Students, p. 329.
            “All who join themselves to the church but not to the Lord will in
         time develop their true character. ‘Ye shall know them by their fruits.’
         Matt. 7:16. The precious fruit of godliness, temperance, patience,
         kindness, love, and charity, does not appear in their lives. They bear
2        only thorns and briers. God is dishonored before the world by all such
         professors.”—Ellen G. White, The Faith I Live By, p. 90.
            					
    Discussion Questions:
          l1 As a class, go over your answer to Sunday’s question. What is
          the distinction between “being” good and “doing” good?

3
          l
          2 Read carefully Ellen White’s statement about how all those
          who join themselves to the church but not to the Lord will soon
          reveal their true character. What does that mean? Why should
          we each ask ourselves in which category we truly belong? How
          can we know for sure the answer?

          l3 Imagine two folk: One is a Seventh-day Adventist who knows
          and believes all the doctrines—state of the dead, Second Coming,
          1844, and so on. This person, however, is mean, harsh, judgmen-
          tal, and unloving. There’s another person who, while professing
          faith in Christ, has rejected all these teachings, accepting what
          we would deem as theological error. Yet, this person is kind, for-
          giving, loving, and nonjudgmental, everything the “orthodox”
          Adventist isn’t. Though, of course, we don’t know hearts, if you
          had to guess which one was closer to the kingdom of God, whom
          would you choose, and why? What does your answer imply
          about what you deem is important in Christianity?

Wyan’s Lessons in Faith
   Wyan [WHY-ann] is 11 years old and lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. He
loves God and was thrilled when his mother enrolled him in a Seventh-day
Adventist school near their home.
   Wyan liked his new school, especially his Bible class where his teach-
ers answered his questions about God in ways that he could understand.
Wyan invited his mother to attend a seminar the school held, and there
they learned that the Sabbath was God’s special day. Wyan wanted to go
to Sabbath School, but his mother explained that Saturday was the busiest
day at her shop. “I can’t afford to close my shop to attend church,” she
said. Wyan prayed about it, and in time his mother decided they should
trust God. She closed her shop and went to church with Wyan.
   The church announced a mission trip to Central America, and Wyan
wanted to go. He asked his mother to go with him, but again she explained
that she didn’t have the money to go and couldn’t afford to close her shop
for the three weeks they’d be gone.
   “God will work it out,” Wyan said. “We just have to trust Him.” Wyan
soon learned that some members were raising money so that he and his
mother could go on the trip. Convinced it was God’s will, Wyan’s mom
closed her shop and went with Wyan on the trip.
   While in Central America, church members held evangelistic meetings
for the adults and the children. Wyan spoke at the children’s meetings, and
at the end of the meetings 23 children gave their hearts to God.
   But all during the mission trip Wyan’s mother worried about her busi-
ness. When they returned home, God had a surprise for her. In the first
week that she was back in her shop, she earned enough to make up for
the three weeks the shop had been closed. “And her business just keeps
growing,” Wyan says.
                              Wyan’s faith helped his mother trust God
                            too. When Wyan asked to be baptized, his
                            mother decided to be baptized too. And to their
                            surprise, Wyan’s grandmother decided to join

                            and urges others to do the same. “If God tells
                            you to tell someone about Jesus, do it. Don’t be
                            afraid; just trust God, and He’ll help you say
                            the right words.”

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Love


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Deut. 6:5, Matt. 5:43–48,
     Matt. 7:12, 22:39, Luke 10:25–37, 1 Cor. 13:4–7.			

Memory Text: “And now abide faith, hope, love, these three;
     but the greatest of these is love” (1 Corinthians 13:13, NKJV).



     I
         t is no accident that Paul’s list of the character traits that identify
         the fruit of the Spirit begins with love. Love is the paramount
         virtue for Christians because it is the trait that most characterizes
     God. It was love that motivated God to create us, to sustain us, to make
     Himself known to us, and to give us His Son in order to redeem us.
       John says it so plainly and simply—“God is love” (1 John 4:16).
     Because love is so central to His character, love must be central to
     ours, as well. “He who abides in love abides in God, and God in him”
     (vs. 16, NKJV).
       Unfortunately, the word love is used very loosely today. We often
     say that we love the weather, we love our favorite food, we love our
     dog. But these kinds of love do not pass the test of true Godlike love
     (see 1 Corinthians 13). It’s something altogether different, something
     that impacts our entire existence, our way of life, our way of relating to
     others. The ingredients of love are a package, not a list from which we
     select those most appealing to us while we disregard the rest. That’s
     not, as we’ll see this week, what true love is all about.

     Love Is Multidimensional (Deut. 6:5)
        “Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your
     heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and
     great commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your
     neighbor as yourself ’ ” (Matt. 22:37–39, NKJV; see also Deut. 6:5).
        Bible translations, as with all written works, differ in word choice.
     For instance, “The bird was little” might read in one translation,
     “The bird was tiny,” or in another, “The bird was small.” And all
     these descriptions would be correct. Therefore, to study the fruit of
     the Spirit, it is helpful to define meanings by going to the original
     language of the word. In Deuteronomy 6:5, the Hebrew word for
     love is ahabta, which refers primarily to love exhibited by the will,
     mind, and actions rather than love exhibited by feelings or emotions.
     It is the highest kind of love, for it motivates one to do what is right
     and noble no matter how one feels. Thus, the love Jesus speaks of in
     the greatest commandment is the noblest, purest, and highest form of
     self-sacrificing love and is that which each person is commanded to
     have toward God.
        The Jewish people already knew that the number-one command
     was to love God with their whole heart, soul, mind, and, as Mark
     adds, strength (see Mark 12:30). In pointing out all four aspects of the
     human being, Jesus simply is calling together all that a person is. He
     is saying, “You need to love God with your entire being.” His intent
     is not to sort out the individual sense of each word; however, much
     could be gained by studying these four aspects.

Read Matthew 7:12 and Matthew 22:39. What’s the important point
     these texts make? How is this essential to the whole concept of
     love?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       To love your neighbor as yourself means to love all people with your
     whole heart. The love spoken of in this “second commandment” is the
     same as in the “first commandment.” It is love in action, involving the
     will and intention. To love our neighbor as ourselves means to take care
     of someone else the same way you would take care of yourself.

      It’s easy to talk about loving others as yourself; what’s not easy
      is doing it. How well do you do in this area? How can you learn
      the hard lessons of death to self in order to minister to the needs
      of others?

                                                                          15

     What Love Does                  (1 Cor. 13:4–8)

       “Love suffers long and is kind; . . . thinks no evil; . . . rejoices
     in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
     endures all things. Love never fails” (1 Cor. 13:4–8, NKJV).

       Love defined is the first step; love applied is the next. We must
     be careful not to glibly say we love; but rather, we need to analyze
     carefully how we live and how well we apply the principles of love
     as expressed in the Bible.

Read 1 Corinthians 13:4–8. Look at each individual aspect of what
     love is and ask, How can I apply these principles in my own
     home?

       Think for a moment of what our homes would be like if by God’s
     grace we consistently practiced the qualities of true love. Imagine the
     blessing of living in an environment where the family members are
     positive and affirming of each other. Perhaps you can’t get others to
     do this, but if you were to apply these principles, you might just see
     how powerful an impact they could make on others. You can’t argue
     against love; it’s the most powerful force in all of creation. People can
     argue against your theology, your lifestyle, your beliefs, your faith—
     everything. But what argument can they use against unconditional
     love, the kind of love revealed to the world through Jesus, the kind of
     love that we can, through His grace, manifest to others?

      Which characteristics of biblical love do you find the most dif-
      ficult to implement in your own life? How can you make a con-
      centrated effort through God’s grace to cultivate more of this
      aspect of love? Why is it important that you do so?

     What Love Doesn’t Do
        Go back over 1 Corinthians 13:4–8, only this time look at it from a
     different perspective. Look at what love does not do. Though these are
     stated in the negative, they are actually other positive characteristics
     of love.

Go through each one of the “negatives” in 1 Corinthians 13:4–8 and
     write down their equivalents in positive terms. Also, as you do,
     ask yourself how well or poorly you manifest these aspects of love
     and how you might be able to do better.

     Does not parade itself = __________________________________

     Is not easily provoked = __________________________________


     Thinks no evil = _________________________________________


     Does not rejoice in iniquity = ______________________________


      As we contemplate the meaning of love detailed in the love
      chapter (1 Corinthians 13), we are able to appreciate the char-
      acter of our heavenly Father, who is the personification of love.
      We also are able to see that the word love as used in the popular
      culture falls far short of a correct understanding of the love of
      God.




                                                                         17

        If we are to love our enemies, we had better discover who exactly
     are our enemies. If an enemy is only the one who threatens your life,
     you may think this text doesn’t apply to you, inasmuch as you prob-
     ably have not had your life threatened lately.
        But by definition, an enemy is an opponent, a rival, a competitor, a
     challenger, a contender. An enemy is one who hates you or who mis-
     treats you. It might even be a spouse or another member of the family.
     There may be times when a family member isn’t very loving. He or
     she may even look for ways to irritate you—or worse. When that hap-
     pens, it is easy to get caught in the trap of retaliation and pettiness.
        Sometimes you may experience conflict on the job, and those you
     have worked with side by side over the years may begin to think of
     you as an opponent. An enemy could be someone you have cared a
     great deal for or even may be someone in your church.
        We need to realize that the enemy Jesus referred to is not limited to
     someone who would threaten our lives but is anyone who causes us
     enough consternation to tempt us to retaliate.

Read Proverbs 15:1, 25:21, and 1 Peter 3:9. How do these texts help
     us understand this important principle regarding love?

      Loving our enemies? Many folk have a hard time showing love
      to their friends, much less their enemies. How can we learn to
      follow Jesus’ example here? How can our hearts be changed
      so that we can love our enemies? How might praying for them
      play a large role in helping us reach this Christian ideal?

     Love in Action (Luke 10:25–37)
        		
        A seminary professor set up his preaching class in an unusual way.
     He scheduled each of his students to prepare a sermon on the story of
     the good Samaritan. One by one they were to go from classroom to
     classroom, preaching love and compassion for others. There was only
     a short break between classes, which forced the would-be preachers to
     rush in order to meet the schedule. Each of the preacher students had
     to walk down a certain corridor and pass by a beggar who had been
     deliberately planted there by the professor.
        What happened was a powerful lesson! The number of would-be
     preachers who stopped to help this man was extremely low, especially
     those who were under the pressure of time. Rushing to preach their
     sermon on the good Samaritan, almost all walked right past the beggar
     at the heart of the parable!

In yesterday’s lesson, we talked about the question of Who is my
     enemy? Today the question is, Who is my neighbor? How does
     Jesus, in Luke 10:25–37, answer that for us? How does this par-
     able tie into the whole question of what true love is? Also, as you
     read this parable, ask the question, Why did Jesus specifically
     place religious people, even religious leaders, in the role of the
     “bad guys”? What lesson is there for us, as well?

       Consider these words: “I was hungry, and you formed a humanities
     club to discuss it. I was imprisoned, but you complained about the
     crime rate. I was naked, and you debated the morality of my appear-
     ance. I was sick, and you thanked God for your health. I was home-
     less, and you preached to me about the shelter of God’s love. You
     seem so holy and so close to God; but I’m still hungry, lonely, cold,
     and in pain. Does it matter?”

      Be honest. What kind of lifestyle changes should you make so
      that you can become a good Samaritan to others? Whom do
      you know right now who is at this moment on the other side of
      the road in the world of hurt? How much death to self will it
      require for you to treat this person as a “neighbor”?

    Further Study: Scientist Arthur Zajonc filled a box with light. But
         he did it so that none of the light reflected off any internal surface.
         Inside the box was light, and light alone. Now, if you looked inside,
         at the light, what would you see? What does light look like?
            Pure darkness, that’s what you’d see. Unless reflecting off of some-
         thing, or unless you stare directly into it, light is invisible.
            Zajonc then took a rod and moved it through the darkness of the
         box. The rod itself, on the side from which the light entered, was
         illuminated. It looked as if a thin light was shining on just the rod,
         nothing else, even though light was everywhere in the box (as if filled
1
         with water). Only when it reflected off from something (the rod) did
         it become visible. Otherwise, the light was darkness.
            On earth, sunlight pouring down on the sky turns it blue, gray, or
         red, depending upon the weather and time of day. On the moon, no
         matter how much sunlight pours down, if you looked up you’d see
         what you’d see in Zajonc’s box, pure darkness, the darkness of empty
2
         space. And that’s because the moon has no atmosphere, no air, no
         moisture, and none of the gases and fumes that, reflecting sunlight,
         turn it into the panoply of color that reigns overhead here.
            Light, unless reflected from something, appears as pure darkness.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 What spiritual lessons about love might we be able to draw
3         from what was written above about the nature of light? See
          1 John 1:5, 2:9–11, 4:8, Luke 11:35.

          l
          2 Luke 23:34 says, “Then Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them, for
          they do not know what they do’ ” (NKJV). Do you pray for your
          enemies? It is difficult to have the right attitude toward those
          who hate us, mistreat us, or persecute us. But praying for our
          enemies has a way of changing our hearts and attitudes toward
          them. When we pray for our persecutors and those who hate us,
          we will begin to see them as people in need of God’s grace just
          as much as we need it. It will give us the power and the desire to
          bless them when they curse us and do good to them when they
          hate us. How can we cultivate the attitude of praying for those
          whom we would really rather curse?

          l
          3 A person saw someone with a broken-down vehicle. He pulled
          over, offering to help, and for his trouble was beaten and robbed.
          “That’s it,” he said. “I’ll never go out of my way to be a good
          Samaritan again.” How would you respond to this person?

Breaking the Chains
   Niyara [Nee-YAH-rah] sighed heavily and looked around the gloomy
room. She was in a hospital for drug addicts in Central Asia. Only 29, she
felt old and tired. She wandered through life with no purpose and no hope.
   She had liked the feeling of forgetfulness she experienced when some-
one first gave her drugs, and she quickly became addicted. She lost inter-
est in work and family, and her life spiraled into her own private hell. Her
parents took her daughter from her and told her to get out. With no place
else to go, she moved in with her addicted friends. She wanted out, but
she didn’t know how to escape.
   A man entered the hospital room to visit another patient. Niyara listened
as they talked. “God will help you overcome your addictions,” the man,
Sergey, said. “Ask Him for help and trust Him to deliver you.”
   Niyara wondered if it was true. She didn’t know this God Sergey spoke
about. What did He think of her and her life? Could He forgive her?
Would He help her? Sergey saw her interest and gave her a Bible. She
searched it for answers to questions that plagued her and for assurance of
forgiveness.
   Niyara was released from the rehabilitation center and met a woman
she knew from her addict days. Niyara was amazed at the change in her
and asked what had happened. The woman told her that she had become
a Christian and had joined a group of former addicts who met to help one
another. “Come with me,” she urged. Niyara attended the meetings and
found hope that she, too, could truly overcome her addictions. Niyara sur-
rendered her life to Christ.
   A month later the group’s leader left the city and asked Niyara to take over
the group. Niyara feared that she couldn’t do it. She cried to God for help, and
felt an overwhelming love for God and for her fellow addicts. While helping
others, she found victory over alcohol and drugs and assured the other women
in the group that they, too, could live a sober and happy life.
   Niyara knew that former addicts need to live away from the temptations
of drugs and alcohol, a place where they can find strength and support to
reestablish their sober life. But where could she find such a place? Niyara
asked God for help, and He is answering her.
   Niyara has learned that with Christ as the center of her life, life can
be beautiful without drugs and alcohol. Today her goal is to help others
learn that God is the secret to living a fulfilling life free of drugs. Pray
for Niyara and for those seeking freedom from the chains of addiction
throughout the world.

Niyara has been baptized and shares her faith in Uzbekistan.

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Joy


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Psalm 139; Luke 15:4–24;
     John 15:10, 11; Heb. 11:16.

Memory Text: “ ‘These things I have spoken to you, that My joy
     may remain in you, and that your joy may be full’ ” (John 15:11,
     NKJV).



     J
          oy and happiness are not necessarily the same thing. Happiness is
          the result of favorable circumstances; joy, in contrast, is the result
          of being—as in being connected to Jesus, the True Vine.
        In Psalm 4:7, joy and happiness are contrasted: “You have given
     me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and
     new wine” (NLT). The “greater joy” comes from knowing and trusting
     God; happiness is a result of pleasant circumstances, such as an abun-
     dant harvest. Inward joy is steady as long as we trust God; happiness
     is as unpredictable as a harvest. Inward joy defeats discouragement;
     happiness covers it up. Inward joy is lasting; happiness is temporary.
        Joy is a delight in life that runs deeper than pain or pleasure. This
     type of joy stems from an awareness of God’s presence in one’s life,
     allowing us to rise above circumstances and focus on the goodness and
     love of God. At the core of Christian joy is the fact that God has acted
     and is acting to save those who trust in Him.

     The Command to Rejoice (Phil. 4:4)
        Many believers allow themselves to be victimized by their circum-
     stances and consequently vacillate between spiritual highs and lows.
     For them, to rejoice seems unreasonable, even impossible. That is
     why the command is to rejoice “in the Lord” (Phil. 4:4).
        We can’t always rejoice in our circumstances or in other people,
     because both of these elements may be negative. However, we
     can rejoice in the Lord, because He is always good, and He never
     changes.
        Our spiritual stability is directly related to our knowledge of and
     commitment to God. Knowing Him helps us live above our circum-
     stances and provides stability. That’s why the psalms were written
     in poetic form and meter and set to music—so the people of Israel
     could memorize Scripture and sing hymns in order to deepen their
     knowledge of God. Knowing Him makes everything else seem less
     significant.

Read Psalm 139; Romans 8:28; and 1 Peter 1:8, 9. What reasons are
     given there for us to rejoice? How can we learn to rejoice in these
     promises of God?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Do you need other reasons to rejoice? How about because God
     saved us, adopted us, and promised to give us an inheritance in Jesus
     Christ (Eph. 1:1–11)? When Christ returns, we will enjoy His pres-
     ence and the heavenly place prepared for us (John 14:2, 3). Until that
     time, it’s a joy to know that God has promised to supply all our needs
     (Phil. 4:19). Furthermore, we have the privilege of serving the One
     we supremely love. That includes sharing the good news with the lost
     and encouraging fellow Christians to increase their love and service
     for Him. It is also a joy knowing we can pray to God at any time (Heb.
     4:15, 16). Finally, we can rejoice knowing that death does not have
     the final word (1 Cor. 15:54).

      Despite these promises, and despite all the reasons we have
      to rejoice, we all struggle with sadness, discouragement, and
      pain. These are the “facts of life” here and now. No matter our
      circumstances, how can we learn to find the joy that’s offered
      us in Christ? What choices are we making that can greatly
      impact whether or not we avail ourselves of the joy that could
      be ours?

                                                                       23

      The Joy of Christ
To understand fully a Christian’s joy, we must look at the joy-filled
      lifestyle of Christ. Where did His joy come from? What were the
      principles by which He lived?

What role does joy have in three of the most popular parables Jesus
      told? What’s the common element in all three stories?

      The Lost Sheep (Luke 15:4–7)

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      The Lost Coin (Luke 15:8–10)

      The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–24)

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        These three parables give us insight into the heart of God. It is a
      heart that is willing to celebrate. It is the pure joy of God, the joy of
      reaching the lost. No wonder that, despite His trials and suffering,
      Jesus was anointed with joy, for He knew that—because of what He
      would accomplish—many people would be saved.
        Consider the significance of the words recorded in Hebrews 12:2, 3.
      Prayerfully contemplate the words: “who for the joy that was set
      before Him endured the cross, despising the shame” (NKJV). Write
      some of the thoughts that come to your mind as you meditate on the
      meaning of these words. What was the joy that was set before Him?
      Why would the salvation of lost souls be so important to God?

       How would you reconcile the idea that Jesus was “a man of sor-
       rows and acquainted with grief” (Isa. 53:3, NKJV) yet at the same
       time was a man of joy? Pick a specific problem in your life that
       causes you sorrow and grief. How, despite this sorrow, can you
       experience for yourself the kind of joy that Jesus experienced?

      Joy in Obedience                  (John 15:11)

Read John 15:10, 11. What is Jesus linking joy to? How, in a practi-
      cal sense, does this work; that is, why should this lead to joy?

         “But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he medi-
      tates day and night” (Ps. 1:2, NKJV).
         “I delight to do Your will, O my God, and Your law is within my
      heart” (Ps. 40:8, NKJV).
         There is no greater joy than the joy of being obedient to the will of
      God. While it may seem to some that an emphasis on obedience to the
      law of God simply serves to exacerbate an already guilty conscience,
      the fact is that obedience to the will of God is liberating. Remember, it
      was disobedience that brought war to heaven and sin and death to this
      planet. All human pain and suffering are the result of humans stepping
      outside the will of God. It will be, then, obedience to the will of God
      through faith that helps restore joy.

Read Psalm 19:8, Jeremiah 15:16, and Matthew 7:21–27. How do
      they link obedience with joy?

      ____________________________________________________________________

         However clear the Bible is that we are not saved by works, it’s also
      clear that works are an inseparable aspect of what it means to have
      salvation. Works reveal to the universe the reality of our salvation, the
      reality of our commitment to God. To call someone a legalist merely
      because that person is adamant about obeying God’s will is, in a real
      sense, to fall into the trap that Isaiah warned about: “Woe unto them
      that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and
      light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” (Isa.
      5:20).

       How have you experienced for yourself the joy that comes from
       obedience? Or to ask the question negatively: How have you
       experienced the pain and suffering that come from not obeying
       the Lord?
                                                                             25

     Joy in Tough Times                    (John 16:33)

     “ ‘These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have
     peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good
     cheer, I have overcome the world’ ” (John 16:33, NKJV).		
     		
        A long-held belief suggests that if a person is passing through diffi-
     culties it is because either that person must be doing something wrong
     or does not have enough faith. What a crude and cold view of God!
     Jesus said clearly that in this life we would all have troubles, both
     the believer and the nonbeliever. However much we love the story of
     Daniel in the lions’ den, the fact is that most of the Christians thrown
     to the lions were torn to shreds by the beasts. The same with the three
     Hebrews who survived the fiery furnace; most Christians tied to the
     stake were, indeed, burned there!

Read Galatians 6:9, James 1:2–4, and 1 Peter 1:6. What hope, what
     promises can we take from these verses that could help us during
     painful times?

       Consider the possibility that many believers today do not have joy
     simply because they are self-centered. However real our problems,
     by focusing solely on them, we only make them worse in our own
     minds. In reality, we do have reasons to rejoice, not in ourselves but
     in God.
       After all, doesn’t God say that “the very hairs of your head are all
     numbered”? (See Matt. 10:30.) Think of the promise inherent in those
     words. If, knowing our security is in Jesus, we would reach out and
     minister to someone else during our times of trial, we would know
     that self-pity can be turned to joy by a simple act of the will. “And
     the Lord restored Job’s losses when he prayed for his friends” (Job
     42:10, NKJV).

      No matter what you might be struggling with now, reach out
      to someone who is, perhaps, going through something hard,
      as well. Surely you know someone who needs help, encourage-
      ment, and support. How can bearing someone else’s burdens
      lighten your own?

     Joy That Lasts (Heb. 11:24, 25)
       “By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the
     son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with
     the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin” (Heb.
     11:24, 25, NKJV). What principles of the Christian life are found in
     these verses? (See also Luke 9:23, Acts 14:22, Phil. 1:29.) How can
     we link those above verses with the promise of joy? (See Heb. 11:16,
     1 Pet. 1:6–8).

        Moses’ decision to turn his back on the throne of Egypt was defi-
     nitely not politically correct. He might have decided to stay in Egypt and
     become the next Pharaoh. He might have rationalized such a move to be
     God’s will for him. After all, it might not have been that hard to do, be-
     cause there are often so many “good” reasons to make a wrong decision.

Think upon the last time you made a wrong decision based on
     “good” reasons. What hard lessons did you learn?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       While joy comes from knowing we are within the will of God,
     the immediate consequences often may be difficult and painful. To
     believe that when we accept Jesus and obey His Word all our prob-
     lems will disappear can lead to disillusionment. Becoming a commit-
     ted Christian is no assurance of money, fame, and influence. Each
     year thousands are persecuted, some even martyred, for their faith.

      In the end, our hope, our salvation, everything has to depend
      upon something greater than this world, greater than what this
      world offers. How crucial that, no matter what we are going
      through, we focus on what Jesus has done for us and what He
      has promised us. Otherwise, we have nothing else but what this
      world in and of itself offers, and as we all know, what it offers can
      at times be very bitter.
                                                                           27

    Further Study: “It is the duty of Christians to convince the
         world that the religion of Christ disrobes the soul of the garments of
         heaviness and mourning and clothes it with joy and gladness. Those
         who receive Christ as a sin-pardoning Saviour are clothed with His
         garments of light. He takes away their sin and imparts to them His
         righteousness. Their joy is full. . . .
            “Who have better right than Christians to sing songs of rejoicing?
         Have they not the expectation of being members of the royal family,
         children of the heavenly King? Is not the gospel good tidings of great
         joy? When the promises of God are freely and fully accepted, heaven’s
1        brightness is brought into the life.”—Ellen G. White, A Call to Medical
         Evangelism and Health Education, p. 26, emphasis supplied.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Go through the Bible and focus on the lives of a few well-
          known characters. How much joy do you think they experi-
2         enced? How about Noah or Abraham or Joseph? What about
          Daniel or David or Jeremiah? Or Paul or John the Baptist?
          What can we learn from their experiences, both the good and the
          bad, about what Christian joy is really about?

          l
          2 What are some worldly ways we can be “happy”? How well
          do these things work? What have you learned about worldly
          ways of achieving happiness? Are they all bad, or can and should
3         they have their place in our lives?

          l3 How much happiness or even joy could or should we expect in
          this life, even as Christians who live with the knowledge of God’s
          infinite love? That is, when all around us we see sickness, suffer-
          ing, and death, and when we know that many souls are going to
          be eternally lost, how much happiness should we have? Isn’t it
          kind of selfish to rejoice in our good fortune while we know that
          others will perish?

          l
          4 Why is it that the more self-centered we are, the more miser-
          able we tend to be?

          l
          5 Why is the hope and promise of eternal life in a whole new
          earth so crucial to our whole Christian experience? What would
          we have without it? How important, then, is it that we keep that
          hope always before us? After all, even if we have it good here in
          this world and in this life, it’s not going to last, so how ultimately
          satisfying could it be?

Searching for Truth
by Tunji Adeeko
   I grew up in a region of Nigeria that included several religions—idol
worshipers and animists, Muslims and Christians. I wondered which faith
contained the truth. I observed and took part in several religious ceremo-
nies, but still I wondered.
   One day some friends and I passed an Adventist church. Someone in
our group made fun of Seventh-day Adventists saying they worshiped on
Saturday. Everyone else laughed, but I wondered. Do some Christians
really worship on Saturday?
   I couldn’t get to the church to learn about the Sabbath, so I read the
Bible looking for answers. I searched for the word Saturday, but I couldn’t
find it. I understood Sabbath to mean Sunday, so I didn’t find a satisfac-
tory answer there either.
   Then I found a tract about the Sabbath and read that God created the
world in six days and rested on the seventh day. As I studied the Bible
texts, I became convinced that the Sabbath was God’s creation, and
Sunday was man’s tradition. It made perfect sense.
   I began to sense that God was someone I could relate to, someone who
created me and wanted a relationship with me. As I continued studying I
understood how God so wanted a relationship with us that He stepped into
human history and shared what He wanted humans to know about Him.
   I found the Bible text that tells us to obey the commandments and have
the faith of Jesus. I realized that Jews accepted the commandments but
do not accept Jesus. Most Christians accept Jesus but don’t keep all the
commandments. I just knew God had a church that had the faith of Jesus
and kept all the Ten Commandments.
   I realized that to worship God in spirit and in truth I had to keep the
Sabbath. I remembered the Adventist church I had seen on the road that
day and found an Adventist church near where I was studying. I began
attending worship services there.
   When I went home for vacation I visited the Adventist church I had seen
months earlier. My sister was upset when she learned that I was attending
the Adventist church, but I knew that I had to find my salvation in Christ,
not through any other person. I would sneak away to church as often as
I could.
   I praise God for showing me the truth. He used a simple church build-
ing, my sister’s ridicule, a Bible, and a tract to lead me to Him. Your
mission offerings help provide the materials that lead people such as me
to the Savior. Thank you.

      The Fruit of the Spirit Is
      Peace
        		




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Lesson: Matt. 8:23–27; 11:28,
  29; Rom. 5:1–11; 12:9–21; Heb. 12:14; Col. 3:13–15.
    				
Memory Text: “ ‘Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to
  you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be
  troubled, neither let it be afraid’ ” (John 14:27, NKJV).




      A
              s a champion of peace, Paul wrote, “endeavoring to keep the
              unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3, NKJV). The
              Greek word translated “endeavoring” is an imperative, exclud-
      ing any passivity, any “wait and see” attitude. We must be proactive.
      If we fight and bicker in our homes, if we fall into factions at church,
      if we refuse to love and honor others, then we are denying the peace
      of God in Jesus Christ, which He established on the cross.
         How ironic that you have to fight for peace. Eleanor Roosevelt, in a
      Voice of America radio broadcast, said, “It isn’t enough to talk about
      peace; one must believe in it. And it isn’t enough to believe in it; one
      must work at it.” The peace that Christ won for us also requires effort,
      hard work, and constant self-examination.
         As we study this week, we should ask ourselves: Have I availed
      myself of the peace that Jesus won for me on the cross? How can I
      cooperate with the Holy Spirit as He engrafts that peace into my daily
      life?

     Peace With God                  (Rom. 5:1)

      “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
     God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:1, NKJV).

       To have peace with God is more than to feel comfortable in His
     presence. It means that we, who once were “alienated and hostile in
     mind, doing evil deeds” (Col. 1:21, ESV), have been reconciled and
     restored to fellowship with God. Once we were at war with God, but
     by His death on the cross, Jesus has made it possible for the hostilities
     to cease and for us to be God’s friends and not His enemies.
       In one sense, this peace is not something we grow in, as in starting
     out with just a little bit of peace. Rather, we are reconciled to God,
     once and for all, by the cross of Christ. It is an accomplished fact.
     There is another sense, though, in which we do grow in peace with
     God. The more clearly we see God’s ways and walk in them, the more
     we appropriate His power to live as His sons and daughters. In this
     sense, peace with God is indeed a fruit of the Spirit. As we grow to
     maturity as children of God, we experience more and more the bless-
     ings and benefits of living in His kingdom until we can say, “Great
     peace have those who love Your law, And nothing causes them to
     stumble” (Ps. 119:165, NKJV).
       Colossians 1:20–22 reveals that sin did not cause God to be merci-
     ful and pardoning; rather, it revealed that He has been that way from
     eternity. The plan of salvation demonstrated that God loved us and
     was willing to forgive even from the beginning.

Read Romans 5:1–11 and summarize what you believe the crucial
     points are here.

      Dwell on this idea that only because of what Jesus has done,
      because of His perfect life credited to you by faith, can you
      stand pardoned, forgiven, and accepted before God, regardless
      of your past. Why is this teaching so important to us if we are
      truly to know peace?
                                                                           31

     Finding Peace: Part 1                      (Matt. 11:28, 29)

       On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 is very peaceful, 10 is very anxious), how
     would you rate your life? People are increasingly frustrated in their
     search for personal peace. In Matthew 11:28, 29, Jesus makes an
     invitation. Though He doesn’t use the word peace, He does use a
     word that means “to give rest, to refresh, to give one’s self rest, to
     take a rest.”

Read the following verses: “ ‘Come to Me, all you who labor and are
     heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and
     learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will
     find rest for your souls’ ” (Matt. 11:28, 29, NKJV). What is Jesus
     saying to us here? How can we experience for ourselves the reality
     of this wonderful promise?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        From what Jesus is saying in these verses, is He proposing to give
     us peace as a gift, or does He mean to show us how to obtain it? Is
     not Jesus teaching that personal peace is a result of some cause and
     inviting us to learn that cause from Him?
        “It is the love of self that brings unrest. . . . Those who take Christ
     at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to
     His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of the world can
     make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In
     perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest. The Lord says, ‘Thou wilt
     keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he
     trusteth in Thee.’ Isa. 26:3.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
     pp. 330, 331.

How does love of self lead to personal unrest and unhappiness?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      How can we learn to die to self and to rest in Jesus? What
      choices can we make, every day, that can help make the promise
      of peace in Christ real? That is, what things are we doing, or not
      doing, that keep us from having the peace that Jesus offers us?

     Finding Peace: Part 2                     (John 14:27)

       The story is told of two painters. Each painted a picture to illustrate
     his concept of rest. The first chose for his scene a still, serene lake
     among the far-off mountains. The second painted a thundering water-
     fall with a fragile birch tree bending over the foam; at the fork of a
     branch, almost wet with the cataract’s spray, a robin sat on its nest.
       Which best portrayed the essence of rest? It is not often in this
     world of turmoil that we find the rest of a lone mountain lake. More
     often we must find our rest amid the turmoil of real life.

Read the story recorded in Matthew 8:23–27 of Jesus and His dis-
     ciples on the Sea of Galilee. (See also Mark 4:35–41, Luke 8:22–25.)
     However unique the situation, what can we take away from this
     account for ourselves; that is, what is the message for us, and how
     can we apply it to our lives, regardless of our situation?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Why do you think Jesus was concerned that His disciples have
     peace? Jesus left us with a beautiful promise about peace: “ ‘Peace I
     leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I
     give to you’ ” (John 14:27, NKJV). How does the peace the world is
     trying to give differ from the peace Jesus offers?
        One thing we mustn’t do is equate peace to a life without problems.
     Rare is the person, even the most faithful Christian, who goes through
     life without trials, pain, and suffering. Indeed, some folk have, it
     seems, more than their share of suffering. Peace, though, has more to
     do with how you handle these situations than with the situations them-
     selves. Peace has to do with the deepest trust in a loving and caring
     God who knows what you are going through and has promised not to
     forsake you, no matter what comes your way.

      What types of things upset you? Talk to God about your deep-
      est fears. Call them by name. Ask the Lord to help you get in
      touch with the fear and identify it. Then take time to allow Him
      to begin to speak peace gently to those fears.
                                                                          33

      Peace at Home                (Heb. 12:14)

        “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
      shall see the Lord” (Heb. 12:14). “If it is possible, as much as depends
      on you, live peaceably with all men” (Rom. 12:18, NKJV). What can
      we learn from the life and example of Jesus that can make these
      admonitions real in our lives? What are we doing (if anything) that
      makes them difficult, if not impossible, to become real for us?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Strange as it may seem, the most difficult place to be a Christian is
      at home. How tragic, when home should be the one place in all the
      world where we all should have peace.
         Two young men were in a battle during the days of the Vietnam
      War. The bullets were flying, and the bombs were exploding. All of
      this didn’t seem to faze one of the soldiers. When his friend asked
      how he could be so calm, he replied that it reminded him of home!

Study Romans 12:9–21. Identify verses in the passage that, if imple-
      mented, would help to bring peace to the home. Give a practical
      application for the verses you chose.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        As Christians, we are called to follow an incredibly high standard,
      the standard presented by Jesus Himself. All of us have fallen short
      of that goal. That being said, it doesn’t mean that we can’t still reflect
      the principles revealed in the life of Jesus, principles of love, self-
      sacrifice, and an uncompromising attitude toward evil and sin.

       Imagine what our homes would be like were we to, indeed,
       reflect these principles! Imagine what it would be like if we
       would learn to think of others before ourselves; imagine if
       we showed others unconditional love, even when folk didn’t
       deserve it. Imagine if we forgave those who hurt us. Imagine if
       we were as concerned about the well-being of others as we were
       about our own selves. Though implementing these principles
       wouldn’t solve all our family problems, no doubt they would
       greatly help!

     Peace in the Church                     (Matt. 5:23, 24)

        “ ‘Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there
     remember that your brother has something against you, leave
     your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be recon-
     ciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift’ ” (Matt.
     5:23, 24, NKJV). What basic principle is Jesus teaching us with
     these words? Why do we find it so hard to implement this prin-
     ciple in our lives?


       It is evident that Jesus takes more seriously our relationships with
     one another than we do. It is not uncommon for bitterness and resent-
     ment to exist for years between members of a church. Imagine how
     different things would be if we all followed this teaching.

Identify a characteristic of the children of God as recorded in
     Matthew 5:9. What does it mean?

According to Colossians 3:13–15, what are three ways we are to
     relate with one another as fellow members of the church? What
     does each one mean?

        Notice the flow of Christian graces in James 3:17: “But the wisdom
     that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield,
     full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypoc-
     risy” (NKJV). What would our churches be like if we would allow the
     Holy Spirit to nurture these qualities in our fellowship? What things
     would be noticeably absent?

      Think about the last time you had a problem with a fellow
      church member. Did you follow Christ’s words in Matthew 5?
      If not, analyze your reasons why you chose the “easy,” worldly
      route as opposed to the path that would have required humility
      and self-denial. How can you learn to do what Jesus calls us to
      in such situations?

                                                                            35

    Further Study: Pss. 4:3, 119:165, Isa. 26:3, Rom. 8:6, Phil. 4:7.

            “Shortly before His crucifixion Christ had bequeathed to His dis-
         ciples a legacy of peace. ‘Peace I leave with you,’ He said, ‘My peace
         I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your
         heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.’ John 14:27. This peace is
         not the peace that comes through conformity to the world. Christ
         never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The peace that
         Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external and was ever
         to remain with His witnesses through strife and contention.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 84.

            “Strife for the supremacy makes manifest a spirit that, if cherished,
         will eventually shut out from the kingdom of God those who cher-
         ish it. The peace of Christ cannot dwell in the mind and heart of a
         workman who criticizes and finds fault with another workman simply
         because the other does not practice the methods he thinks best, or
         because he feels that he is not appreciated. The Lord never blesses
2
         him who criticizes and accuses his brethren, for this is Satan’s work.

    Discussion Questions:

          agreements arise?

          l2 What are the common situations we face in our daily lives
          that threaten our peace? What Bible promises can we claim

          l
          3 Of course, it’s always easy to talk about trusting the Lord no
          matter our circumstances and from that trust deriving peace.
          And that’s true. At the same time, what concrete and practical
          steps can we take to change the circumstances that make peace
          difficult? In other words, how often might our unease and fear
          be the result of choices that we make?

God’s Man
by Mayra Castaneda
   I grew up in a family that considered itself Christian, but we seldom
attended church. When I was 19, I met a young man who was very differ-
ent from most men I knew.
   I had seen him passing my house from time to time, sometimes waving.
Then one day he stopped to talk. His name was David, and he said he was
a Seventh-day Adventist. I had heard of Adventists, but I knew nothing
about their beliefs. David asked me whether I would like to know more
about God.
   “I don’t believe in God,” I said. “He is an invention of people who
needed a crutch in life.” I felt confident in my answer because I had visited
a number of churches in the area, and they all seemed phony.
   David was polite but persistent, and while still standing outside my
house, we began talking about God. I asked many questions about God
and science and was impressed that each of his answers was backed up
with Bible texts.
   David returned often, but my father wouldn’t let him inside the house,
so we sat outside. David shared his faith and loved Bible texts, and I asked
questions. We became friends, and soon I became convinced that God was
real and that David knew Him personally. During one of David’s visits I
accepted Jesus as my Savior.
   My parents noticed I was changing, that I was reading my Bible and
praying. My father warned me about getting serious with a man who had
a strange religion.
   Whenever we were together, our conversations always turned to God,
for God was such an important part of David’s life. He invited me to some
evangelistic meetings at his church. I went when I could and realized
that the Adventist Church was where I belonged. It was real; the people
were real; their faith was real. I told David that I wanted to become an
Adventist. We already had studied the doctrines, so one Sabbath I slipped
away to church and was baptized.
   When my father learned I had been baptized, he told me to leave home.
I was stunned. I stayed with my grandmother until my parents gave her
trouble and I had to find another place to live.
   I don’t regret my decision to follow Christ, even though my parents won’t
let me near my sister for fear I’ll contaminate her. And I probably would.
   Please pray that my family’s hearts will be softened and that they will
accept Jesus into their lives. And thank you for supporting mission, which
made it possible for me to meet Christ.

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Patience
       		
       								




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 6:3; Exod. 34:6; Mark
     4:26–29; Rom. 15:5; Eph. 4:1, 2; James 1:2–4.

Memory Text: “For you have need of endurance [patience], so
     that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the
     promise” (Hebrews 10:36, NKJV).




     I
         n the Greek, two words express the meaning of “patience,” another
         fruit of the Spirit. The first is hupomone, translated “endurance,
         steadfastness, and fortitude” in circumstances that cannot be
     changed. The second word, makrothumia, means “great” or “long
     tempered.” It is the opposite of short-tempered, impatient, and eas-
     ily frustrated. In general, it means to stick with things and not to be
     derailed by adversity. The word is usually applied to having patience
     with people.
        A patient person is mild, gentle, and constant in all circumstances.
     The real test of patience is not in the waiting but in how one behaves
     while waiting. “But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be
     perfect and complete, lacking nothing” (James 1:4, NKJV).
        Reaching this point in one’s life takes practice, takes God’s grace,
     and takes a willingness to put aside self and to surrender to the prompt-
     ing of the Holy Spirit. The good news is that if we learn patience, we
     are in a position to receive many other blessings from God, as well.

     Patience Is an Attribute of God (Exod. 34:6)
       “And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, ‘The Lord,
     the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abound-
     ing in goodness and truth’ ” (Exod. 34:6, NKJV).

        One of the many Bible stories illustrating the patience of God was His
     dealing with Nineveh. The prophet Jonah recognized God’s patience:
     “ ‘Ah, Lord, was not this what I said when I was still in my country?
     Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You are a gra-
     cious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness,
     One who relents from doing harm’ ” (John 4:2, NKJV).
        Note some of the other qualities that patience is combined with
     in Exodus 34:6. God’s grace, mercy, lovingkindness, goodness, and
     truth protect and sustain even the most hardened sinners in order to
     give them the maximum time and advantage to turn their lives around.
     If God struck out at people as quickly as humans frequently do, we’d
     all be dead.

Why is God patient with sinners? (See 2 Pet. 3:8, 9.) How have you
     seen the reality of this truth manifested toward yourself or toward
     others?

        If someone were to ask you how you picture God in your mind, how
     would you describe Him? This is revealing, because how a Christian
     thinks of God has a lot to do with his worldview and how we treat
     others. If we see God as angry and quick to punish, how would we
     likely treat others in the church and in our homes?

      How can we learn to do what the Lord calls us to do in Romans
      15:5?

     Patience Required                    (Eph. 4:1, 2)

Read Ephesians 4:1, 2. Look at the elements Paul presents for those
     who are to “walk worthy” of the Lord. Among them is patience.
     How is patience linked with the other attributes presented? That
     is, how do they feed into each other?

     ____________________________________________________________________

         The church is made up of a mixture of people from various back-
     grounds and cultures. It also includes people who are on different rungs
     of the maturity ladder. Patience is necessary to be able to get along
     where there are so many differences. It is a temptation for those who
     are mature to be impatient toward those less so. In spite of the fact that
     it took years for them to arrive at their present level of knowledge, often
     the mature are unwilling to give the immature the same amount of time
     and study to reach their level of knowledge and understanding.

What is Paul’s counsel on how we are to deal with those who may be
     weak in faith? Rom. 14:1, 15:1.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Patience in the church is one thing. But what about patience at
     home? What are some of the things that make us impatient with other
     members of our family? How long should we pray for family mem-
     bers who are out of the faith? Have you ever known anyone who had
     to pray for a loved one for many years before the person gave his or
     her heart to the Lord? What are practical ways in which we can learn
     to cultivate patience with family members? Why is death to self so
     important here too?
       Also, if we can be patient at home, with those who are always “in
     our face,” then we likely will be patient with others, as well.

      Think about how patient the Lord has been with you. How
      does keeping that reality constantly before you help you learn
      to show patience with others? If the Lord treated you as you
      treated others, what do you think would be your fate?

     Patience in the Gospel                      (2 Tim. 4:2)

        Preaching and teaching the gospel is one of the most difficult areas
     in which to exercise patience. Most of us are too impatient with
     people who don’t know the truth or who don’t seem to care about it.
     But in a world full of false doctrine and prejudice against truth, we
     must be longsuffering as we seek to lead people to Christ. It is too
     easy to shake our head and say, “Why don’t they understand? The
     truth is so plain.”
        The truth always is plain to the person who is not looking at it
     through glasses tinted by false doctrine, tradition, family, and so forth.
     We must be patient as we seek to open minds and untie the tentacles
     of prejudice and false teaching that bind them to error and tradition.

Read Mark 4:26–29. What are some practical lessons from this par-
     able about patience in the area of soul winning?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       We are prone to think that when someone studies a particular Bible
     doctrine and doesn’t accept it immediately, it must mean the person
     has rejected the truth. That, however, is not necessarily the case. The
     fact is that conversion can be a long, complicated process that could
     take years in some instances. Though many of us might be eager to
     see the immediate fruit of our labors, it doesn’t always happen that
     way. What’s important is that, in our zeal, we don’t become a hin-
     drance to someone; that is, we must not push so hard that the person
     gets turned off. Most important, we never must condemn or judge
     someone who doesn’t make a commitment to the truths that we love
     and care so deeply about at the precise time that we think the person
     should. Your labors, your work for the person, could very well be an
     important step in a process that might not bear fruit for years. You just
     don’t know. The crucial thing is not to ruin it all by being condemna-
     tory or judgmental.

      What crucial point found in 1 Samuel 16:7 should we always
      keep in mind in this context (and in all contexts, really)?

     Patience Has Its Limits                    (Gen. 6:3)

       No greater demonstration of patience can be found than that shown
     by God toward humans. But we must understand that even God’s
     longsuffering has a limit.
       The longsuffering of God lasted for 120 years in the days of Noah
     while the ark was being prepared (1 Pet. 3:20). But the time came
     when the stubbornness of the people exhausted the longsuffering of
     God, and He destroyed the earth with a flood.

Read Genesis 6:3. What important principle is seen there?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In the cases of Sodom and Gomorrah, Israel in the wilderness,
     and the Babylonian captivity, what attitude on the part of the people
     prompted the consequences that the people suffered? Deut. 31:27, Ps.
     95:8, Jer. 17:23.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        It might be argued that, inasmuch as God ran out of patience, this
     gives us permission to do the same. But when we study the history of
     God’s longsuffering, it becomes evident that His patience was not for
     a day, a week, or even a year. Often generations would pass before
     His longsuffering would be exhausted, which, of course, is not an
     option open to us.
        Is there a point where our patience legitimately can run out when
     dealing with folk in a difficult situation? It depends on what that
     means. We might decide that we’ve had enough of a certain situa-
     tion and conclude that it has to end. But that’s not the same thing as
     being judgmental, unloving, or cruel in the process. It might be time
     to take action, but that action never must be out of harmony with the
     principles of kindness, love, and caring.

      Dwell on situations in which your patience ran out legitimately
      and illegitimately. What was the difference between the two?
      What have you learned from these experiences? If you had to
      do them over again, what would you do differently?

How to Develop Patience                          (James 1:2–4)

   “My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various tri-
als, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But
let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and
complete, lacking nothing” (James 1:2–4, NKJV). What has been
your own experience with the reality of these verses? What have
you learned from the various trials you have faced that, in the
end, have made you a better person, one who better reflects the
character of Jesus?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

   The Greek word for “trials,” sometimes translated “temptations,”
is the word peirazo, which has the broader significance of “proving”
or “testing.” The devil tries us or tempts us to do evil. The tests and
trials that God allows to come into our lives are for the purpose of
developing our characters.
   “The trials of life are God’s workmen, to remove the impurities and
roughness from our character. Their hewing, squaring, and chiseling,
their burnishing and polishing, is a painful process; it is hard to be
pressed down to the grinding wheel. But the stone is brought forth
prepared to fill its place in the heavenly temple. Upon no useless
material does the Master bestow such careful, thorough work. Only
His precious stones are polished after the similitude of a palace.”
—Ellen G. White, Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 10.
   This doesn’t mean, however, that every trial is in God’s providence.
Often we bring suffering upon ourselves through disobedience; often,
too, trials and suffering are just the results of what it means to live in
a fallen, sinful world where we have an enemy who hates us (1 Pet.
5:8). What this does mean, however, is that through a complete sur-
render of ourselves to the Lord, to grasping hold of Him in faith and
obedience, no matter what we go through, we can come out better or
more refined if we allow God to work in us. No one said it will be fun.
Life here often isn’t fun, but we are given this wonderful promise:
“Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6).
                                                                      43

    Further Study: “In His dealings with the human race, God bears
         long with the impenitent. He uses His appointed agencies to call men
         to allegiance, and offers them His full pardon if they will repent. But
         because God is long-suffering, men presume on His mercy. ‘Because
         sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the
         heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.’ The patience
         and long-suffering of God, which should soften and subdue the soul,
1
         has an altogether different influence upon the careless and sinful. It
         leads them to cast off restraint, and strengthens them in resistance. They
         think that the God who has borne so much from them will not heed
         their perversity. If we lived in a dispensation of immediate retribution,
         offenses against God would not occur so often. But though delayed, the
         punishment is none the less certain. There are limits even to the forbear-
2
         ance of God. The boundary of His long-suffering may be reached, and
         then He will surely punish. And when He does take up the case of the
         presumptuous sinner, He will not cease till He has made a full end.”
         —Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, p. 1166.
            		
    Discussion Questions:
          l1 To say that God is patient is not the same as to say that He is
          tolerant. What is the difference between patience and tolerance,
3         and why is it easy to confuse the two?

          l2 As we look at the life of Christ, how does He reveal what
          patience means? What are some powerful examples that He
          gives of patience? What examples does He give, if any, of situa-
          tions in which patience was no longer appropriate?
          		
          l3 Dwell more on the question of trials and character. Sure,
          trials can make our character better in many cases. At the same
          time, what happens when trials embitter people, turn them away
          from God, and make them cynical and doubtful? Have you ever
          seen that happen to someone? If so, what can you learn from
          that experience?

          l
          4 Besides trials, what are other ways the Lord can teach us
          patience? How have you learned (or are still learning) the lesson
          of patience?
          				
          l5 Is there someone you need to apologize to because of your
          lack of patience? Why not humble yourself and make the apol-
          ogy and do whatever else it takes to make things right? Isn’t that
          what being a Christian is all about?

   In some places in the world it’s illegal and often dangerous to share
one’s faith with others. Sometimes radio and television signals may be
the only means to reach people with the gospel. New believers risk their
lives to follow Jesus.
   Not long ago Adventist World Radio received the following e-mails
from a young man living in one of these difficult areas. We share his mes-
sages with you, for through your mission offerings, you help make these

try]. Please help me to learn more about Christianity and Jesus Christ. I’m
eager to know. May I have a Bible? Please, pray for me. [He was sent a
link to an Internet Bible.]”

Two months later
  “I have received Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, and my life has
changed. Every day I read the Bible on the Internet, and I’m learning more.
God’s Word makes my heart come alive. It’s true what He said, ‘I am the light
of the world.’ ‘I’m the way, the truth, and the life’ [John 8:12, John 14:6]. I
wish I could share the Word of God with someone and pray with them.”

Two months later [Amin’s family has learned of his new faith.]
  “Every day they abuse me. My father tore up my Christian books and
said, ‘If I see one more book like those in your hands, I will bury you.’ I
know that Jesus said, ‘Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute
you.’ I pray and read the Bible every day, but I can’t receive any letters
because my father will read them.”

A few days later
  “They’ve taken my computer, and I must go to the cyber café.
Yesterday, two policemen came to our house and threatened me, calling
me a terrorist for being a follower of Jesus Christ.
  “I’m sure I’ll be taken to prison soon. I’m not asking for help. No one
can help me but the Lord. I don’t know what will happen to me. Maybe this
e-mail will be the last one. I love Jesus, and am ready to die for Him.”

  Note: This was the last message received from Amin. Pray for him and
for thousands like him who face persecution and death for their faith.

Amin is not his real name. Benjamin Schoun is president of Adventist World Radio.

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Kindness


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Sam. 9:1–13; Prov.
     15:1–5; 25:11–15; Matt. 5:43–48; Luke 6:35, 38; Eph. 4:32; Col.
     3:12–14.

Memory Text: “Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
     put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffer-
     ing” (Colossians 3:12, NKJV).



     W
                hen Paul illustrated how love behaves, patience came into
                his mind first: “Love suffers long” (1 Cor. 13:4, NKJV).
                Immediately after patience, he wrote that love “is kind,”
     showing that love and kindness so belong together that without kind-
     ness no act is truly done in love!
        Patience, we saw, is love forbearing. Kindness, on the other hand,
     implies a more active expression of love. Often patience might be
     manifested by doing nothing; kindness, in contrast, is manifested by
     what we say and do and, more important, by how we say it and do it
     and, even more important, why we say and do it.
        Kindness is not beyond the reach of any, although it may require
     the sacrifice of time and energy. Kindness is a verb that reveals itself
     in numerous ways. And like its close cousin “love,” kindness contains
     incredible power; it is a witness in and of itself of what our God is
     like.

The Model of Kindness                        (Matt. 5:43–48)

  Jesus clearly illustrates in the Sermon on the Mount the kind-
ness and goodness of God. Read Matthew 5:43–48 and answer the
following questions:

• To what high standard is Jesus calling us here?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

• What reason does Jesus give for calling us to this standard?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

• Notice Christ’s use of the word perfect in verse 48. What is the
meaning of perfect here, and how can the use of the word here
help us understand what it means to be perfect like “our Father
in heaven” is perfect?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

   God’s gracious gifts are just that, gracious gifts. They are unearned
and unmerited by all human beings, all of whom have willingly
sinned against Him and either ignored or neglected Him. In this sense
the greatest sinner is in the same boat as the holiest saint: neither
deserves the kindness and goodness that God gives to us all.
   With these verses, Jesus is calling us to be “perfect,” even as perfect
as God is. How so? By loving our enemies, by praying for those who
mistreat us, by being kind to those who have not been kind to us. This
is how Jesus defines being “perfect.” Try to imagine what our church
would be like and what our homes would be like were we to die to self
so that we actually could live this way! We would have a power and a
witness against which the gates of hell could never prevail. What’s the
only thing stopping us? Nothing but our sinful, vengeful hearts, which,
more often than not, cause us to act like “publicans.”

 What painful and deep changes must you make if you are going
 to follow Christ’s words in these verses?

                                                                      47

     Kindness to a “Dead Dog”
Read 2 Samuel 9:1–13. How did David show kindness here? How did
     he, by this act, reveal the character of God?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        “Through reports from the enemies of David, Mephibosheth had
     been led to cherish a strong prejudice against him as a usurper; but
     the monarch’s generous and courteous reception of him and his con-
     tinued kindness won the heart of the young man; he became strongly
     attached to David, and, like his father Jonathan, he felt that his inter-
     est was one with that of the king whom God had chosen.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 713.
        David’s kindness to the house of Saul reveals that he sought to use
     God as the pattern for what he wanted to do for Saul’s house. He
     recognized that he, a sinner like all of us, had received undeserved
     mercy and kindness from the hand of God and was going to reflect
     that kindness to others.

Before we can pass on God’s kindness to others, what must we first
     recognize? See Luke 7:47. What crucial principle is found here
     that can play an important role in helping us understand the
     whole question of kindness to others?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Think for a few moments about the goodness and kindness of God
     toward you. Do you deserve it? Is it something that’s owed you? Are
     your thoughts, your deeds, your words so selfless, so holy, so loving and
     accepting that God is merely doing to you as you have done to others?
     Most likely the answer is No. And herein is a crucial point. When we
     realize how much God has forgiven us, when we realize that God loves
     us despite what we are and what we have done, then we truly can under-
     stand what it means to be kind and loving to those who don’t deserve
     our kindness or our love. How important, then, that we keep the Cross
     and what it means to us, individually, before us at all times.

      What things has God forgiven you for over the years? How
      should that realization help you treat those who have done
      things to hurt you?

Kind Words (Eph. 4:32)
   Ephesians 4:32 begins with the words, “And be kind to one
another” (NKJV). Look at how this verse fits in perfectly with what
we saw yesterday, about treating others as God has treated us!
   Kindness is to mark the Christian at all times. But there are at least
three specific needs that call for three specific kinds of encourage-
ment.
   First, we are to show kindness to spiritual babies. “But we were
gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own chil-
dren” (1 Thess. 2:7, NKJV).
   Second, we are to show kindness and encouragement to the weak.
“We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak,
and not to please ourselves” (Rom. 15:1, NKJV).
   Third, we are to serve as a nurse to the spiritually sick (2 Tim. 2:24,
25).
   A businessman was once heard to say, “I can’t wait to get home
at night—I get so tired of being kind all day!” What a sad attitude to
have toward human life.
   Kindness, especially in our homes, is crucial. And one of the most
important ways we can manifest kindness, especially in our homes, is
in the way we talk to each other. The atmosphere of the home largely
is determined by the words we speak. So many problems, so many
hurts, so many tensions and outright fights could be avoided if we
were careful not only with what we say but how we say it. Oftentimes
one could say something and not hurt or offend, or one could say the
exact words to the same person and greatly hurt and offend. The key is
how we speak. Human speech is more than just the meanings of words
themselves; tone, facial expression, body language, and stress are all part
and parcel of conveying our thoughts, emotions, and ideas to others.

 Read Proverbs 15:1–5 and Proverbs 25:11–15. What important
 principles about what you say and how you say it are revealed
 in these texts? As you read them, ask yourself about your use of
 words when talking to others. In what ways could you be kinder
 in your verbal communication with others?

     Kindness Returned                    (Luke 6:38)

       “ ‘Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed
     down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your
     bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be mea-
     sured back to you’ ” (Luke 6:38, NKJV). What is Jesus saying
     here? What principle of life is He talking about?
       				
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        So often, how we treat others comes back on ourselves. That is,
     when we are kind, it’s so much likelier that others will be kind to
     us. It works the other way, too: be mean to others, and others will be
     mean to you, as well.
        Of course, it doesn’t always happen that way. (Look at Jesus and
     how He was treated!) But whether it does or doesn’t, in one sense it
     doesn’t really matter. As Christians, we always should be kind, even
     if that kindness is not given back to us. In fact, as we have read, being
     kind to those who are unkind to us is a hallmark of being a true fol-
     lower of Jesus. In general, however, how we treat others will impact
     how we ourselves are treated. “ ‘Therefore, whatever you want men
     to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets’ ”
     (Matt. 7:12, NKJV).

Read Luke 6:35. How does this fit in with what we’ve been talking
     about all week?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       It’s always easy to be kind to someone who could be of benefit to
     you down the road. Anyone will do that. What’s harder, however, is
     to be kind, especially when it costs you something, to those who can
     never do anything for you in return. That’s the real test.

      Examine yourself. Is your kindness motivated by selfless and
      self-sacrificial love, or is it motivated even slightly by a desire
      to look out for number one? If it’s the latter, how can you
      change?

     Put on Kindness (Col. 3:12–14)
Read Colossians 3:12–14 and then rewrite it in your own words. In
     what ways do these verses reveal the essence of what it means to
     be a follower of Christ (notice the use of the term perfect or per-
     fection)? Also, think about how powerful our witness to the world
     would be were we to put these words into practice.

        Alexander Maclaren, noted London clergyman of the late nine-
     teenth century, wrote, “Gentleness is the strongest force in the world.
     You take all the steam hammers that were ever forged and battle at
     an iceberg, and except for the comparatively little heat that is devel-
     oped by the blows and melts some small portion, it will still be ice,
     though pulverized instead of whole. But let it move gently down to
     the southward, there the sunbeams smite the coldness of death, and it
     is dissipated in the warm ocean. Kindness is conquering.”
        As Seventh-day Adventists, we have very powerful scriptural evi-
     dence to back up our positions. (If we don’t, then what are we doing
     here?) And that’s, of course, important. But we need more than just
     correct teaching, don’t we?
        “If we would humble ourselves before God, and be kind and courte-
     ous and tenderhearted and pitiful, there would be one hundred con-
     versions to the truth where now there is only one.”—Ellen G. White,
     Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 189.
        When we teach the doctrines of the church, we include the Sabbath,
     the state of the dead, the origin of sin, and other defining beliefs. But
     are we as careful about emphasizing the importance of kindness and
     the other fruit of the Spirit, along with the Sermon on the Mount and
     1 Corinthians 13? Knowing that the Sabbath is the seventh day or
     that the dead sleep until the resurrection or that Christ’s righteousness
     covers us now and in the final judgment is all fine and important. But
     having knowledge alone isn’t the same thing as knowing the truth as
     it is in Jesus (John 14:6), for the truth sets us free (John 8:32); that is,
     the truth changes us and makes us more like Christ. Could one then
     ask, Do we really have the truth if the Truth, Jesus, doesn’t have us?
                                                                             51

    Further Study: “From every Christian home a holy light should
         shine forth. Love should be revealed in action . . . showing itself in
         thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish courtesy. There are homes
         where this principle is carried out—homes where God is worshiped
         and truest love reigns. From these homes morning and evening prayer
1
         ascends to God as sweet incense, and His mercies and blessings
         descend upon the suppliants like the morning dew.”—Ellen G. White,
         The Adventist Home, p. 37, emphasis supplied.
            “There are many who regard the expression of love as a weakness,
         and they maintain a reserve that repels others. This spirit checks
         the current of sympathy. As the social and generous impulses are
2        repressed, they wither, and the heart becomes desolate and cold. We
         should beware of this error. Love cannot long exist without expres-
         sion. Let not the heart of one connected with you starve for the want
         of kindness and sympathy.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home,
         p. 107, emphasis supplied.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 As a class, go over the final question at the end of Thursday’s
3         study: “Do we really have the truth if the Truth, Jesus, doesn’t
          have us?” What are the implications of your answer?

          l
          2 “Love cannot long exist without expression.” What does that
          mean, and why does it represent a principle that’s so important
          for us as a church?
          			
          l3 Review the texts this week that talked about us being “per-
          fect.” How should we understand what this idea means? What
          are the common problems and misconceptions that we as a
          church have struggled with over the use and meaning of this
          term?

          l4 Trace in your own experience how the attitudes of other
          Adventists have affected you and your faith. That is, were folk
          kind to you and, if so, how did that kindness impact you? On
          the other hand, were folk unkind to you and, if so, how did that
          impact you? Share your stories with others in the class. What
          can you take away from these experiences that can help the class
          better understand how important kindness is in our witness?

The Unseen Bodyguard
   Abraham Oril lives in the central Philippines. He operates a small gro-
cery store to support his family, but his passion is sharing Christ.
   Abraham hosts a radio program that is aired locally. Every Sunday
morning he rides to the radio station to produce his live program. On one
of his broadcasts, he discussed the Sabbath. One listener became angry at
what Abraham was saying. When the program ended, Abraham left the
station, got on his motorbike, and headed home. Along the way he noticed
another motorbike approaching from behind. When the second motorbike
pulled up beside him, Abraham saw a gun.
   The two men on the second motorbike sped on ahead of Abraham and
stopped in an area where there were no houses. The man with the gun got
off the bike and pointed the gun at Abraham as he approached.
   “God, save me if it’s Your will,” Abraham prayed as he neared the two
men. Abraham rode past the two men without harm and arrived home
safely.
   The next Sunday’s radio broadcast was a continuation of the previous
week’s message on the Sabbath. When Abraham finished the program,
he and his friend Carlito walked out of the station. The same two men
he had seen the previous week stood near his motorbike. And Abraham
could see the glint of metal in the sun. But this time the men were armed
with knives. As the two men moved toward Carlito and Abraham, Carlito
raised his hand to block the attack. One of the men raised his knife to
attack, but fell down before touching Abraham or Carlito. In the fall the
attacker broke his arm. He struggled to his feet, and the two men ran away,
leaving Abraham and Carlito standing alone.
   The story of the thwarted attack spread quickly throughout the area. The
brother-in-law of the man who had tried to attack Abraham told people,
“Surely these are men of God. Why else would angels defend them when
they were attacked?” Abraham learned that the two men who had tried to
attack them intended to kill him, but an unseen force had prevented the
men from harming Carlito and Abraham.
   Abraham continued broadcasting the radio programs, and at least two
young men were baptized as a result of Abraham’s radio broadcast and his
testimony of God’s protection.
   Your mission offerings help carry the message of God’s love to the
world. Thank you for sharing so others can hear the message of God’s
salvation.

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Goodness

Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 51:10, 11; John 14:9;

     I
         n Scripture, “goodness” involves not only exhibiting right behav-
         ior but also avoiding its opposite, evil. Goodness is holiness put
         into practice. Goodness is what we do; otherwise, it’s not “good-
     ness” at all.
       The word translated “goodness” (agathosune) in Galatians 5:22
     denotes an active, even aggressive, goodness. More than an excel-
     lence of character, it is character energized, expressing itself in good
     deeds.
       We often hear that someone has a “good heart” or that someone is a
     “good soul.” However problematic that idea is theologically (see Jer.
     17:9), it’s even more so in reality. A “good heart” or a “good soul”
     in and of itself means nothing. Instead, a “good heart” is revealed in
     good actions, good deeds, in concrete, practical acts of goodness that
     benefit others. Good intentions, good thoughts, good motives are fine
     and have their role, but in the end, goodness is to do good. We fool
     ourselves into thinking otherwise.

      God Is Good
        In the Bible the most profound and absolute sense of “good” is
      predicated on God alone. Thus, although the term good is used freely
      in many circumstances, although there are good and bad individuals
      (Matt. 5:45), although it is possible for Christians to do good works
      (Eph. 2:10), although everything that God created He pronounced
      very “good” (Gen. 1:31), Jesus declares that God alone is “good”
      (Mark 10:18). Only God’s goodness is absolute. All others have
      degrees of goodness as measured against this absolute standard.

What do the following texts reveal about how the goodness of God
      can be revealed in our lives? Exod. 33:19, Pss. 25:8, 86:5, 107:21,
      Nah. 1:7, Rom. 8:28.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        God, however, doesn’t just tell us that He is good; He has revealed
      that goodness to us in numerous ways.
        We can see the goodness and love of God in creation. Even in a
      fallen world, even with sickness, pestilence, and natural disasters, the
      goodness of God is still revealed in nature.
        Think of human relationships, love, concern, caring for others. We
      are capable of these wonderful and good things only because God cre-
      ated us with the potential for this, and He did so because He is good.
        Human sexuality, though, of course, having been perverted in
      horrific and unimaginable ways, nevertheless at the core reveals the
      goodness of God and His love for human beings.

What is the greatest revelation of God’s goodness given to humanity?
      John 14:9; Heb. 1:2, 3.

       understand the goodness of God. That is, despite whatever
       trials you have gone through, how have you come to know for

     All Have Sinned
Read Romans 3:12–20. How do we see the reality of these words
     manifested all around us? How do you see it manifested in your
     own life?

       One of the sad facts of life is that there can be some very gifted
     and talented people, charming people, charismatic people, people of
     great skill and insight whom we often label as “good” when, in fact,
     they are rotten to the core. The word good can, like the word love, be
     so readily and cheaply thrown around that it loses its true meaning.
     When we keep the idea of God’s goodness before us, we can much
     better understand what human goodness is really, and ideally, about.

How often we hear non-Christians say that they don’t understand
     all this Christian talk about humans being naturally sinful and
     so forth. Aren’t there, after all, people who do good things, who
     express kindness, selflessness, and unconditional love? Haven’t
     we all seen people who are like that? How would you respond to
     this kind of argument?

       Years ago, Russian writer Feodor Dostoevsky wrote a book about
     his time in a Siberian prison camp, where some of Russia’s worst
     criminals were incarcerated. Among the prisoners were those who
     had committed some of the most vile and heinous crimes imaginable.
     Yet Dostoevsky wrote about how, at times, these men were capable
     of doing some of the gentlest and kindest acts. The point is that even
     the worst people can do kind deeds. And at the same time, who hasn’t
     seen really good people, when pushed, do some pretty bad things?

      What about yourself? Are you not capable of doing some very
      kind and loving deeds? Are you not capable of doing some very
      cruel and evil ones too? What do your answers tell you about
      yourself and your need of Jesus?

      God’s Law and Goodness
Read Romans 7:7–12. What point is Paul making about the law
      here? Why does he stress that the law is good?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The problem some have with the law of God is a misunderstand-
      ing of its role in the plan of salvation. When we go to the doctor
      with an ailment, there must first be a diagnosis before there can be a
      treatment. The problem comes when folk confuse the diagnosis with
      the treatment. The law of God not only serves as the standard, it also
      occupies a diagnostic role in the salvation process. Paul states simply
      that without the law he would not have known what sin was. The law,
      then, diagnoses us all as sinners. Without this diagnosis, there is little
      incentive to come to Jesus for healing.
         In the plan of salvation, the law of God is indispensable, because
      without the law there is no sin, and without sin there is no need for
      a Savior.

In Psalm 40:8, David writes, “I delight to do Your will, O my God, and
      Your law is within my heart” (NKJV). Why, then, might some
      people believe that keeping the law is a burden?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         We sometimes think of law as a prohibition—a “thou shalt not.”
      And there is some truth to that. Yet, at the same time, there are infi-
      nitely more things that we can do than we cannot do. Think, too, of
      all the practical benefits of keeping God’s law. Think of the ways it
      improves the quality of our lives here and now. Shouldn’t we trust in
      God’s goodness enough to know that if He forbids it, then it must not
      be good for us?

       Do you find keeping the law to be a burden? If so, why? If the
       Bible says that keeping the law is a delight, what are we doing
       wrong if it’s a burden to us?

     Walking in Goodness
        “Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
     then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil” (Jer.
     13:23).
        		
        The text above makes a simple point about human nature, which is that
     we don’t change easily, especially the bad aspects of our character. (Ask
     most married folk about how easy it is to change a spouse!) With this
     thought in mind, we can perhaps better understand why the scriptural con-
     cept of goodness is immensely deeper and its use much more restricted than
     is commonly used in the world. The fruit of the Spirit that is goodness is
     more inward, touching on every thought, word, and action of the godly per-
     son. This demands that motives be right before we call any action “good.”
     It means that the good person is one from whom righteousness (right doing)
     flows from inward devotion and love toward God.

       “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit
     within me” (Ps. 51:10, NKJV). “How can a young man cleanse his
     way? By taking heed according to Your word” (Ps. 119:9, NKJV).
     What is the message of these texts in regard to how we can
     become “good”?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

Compare those texts to what Paul says in Romans 7:18. How are
     all these texts related?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In chapter 7 of Romans, Paul expresses his disappointment that
     in spite of his best intentions he has no strength within himself to
     do good (vss. 18, 19). But in chapter 8, verses 1–4, he reveals the
     Christian’s secret to overcoming this dilemma. What is the secret?
     Discuss what it means to “walk in the Spirit.” How is this done?

      It’s one thing to acknowledge that we are sinners, in need of
      grace, and that our good works cannot save us. At the same
      time, why must we be careful not to use this teaching as an
      excuse to live in the flesh? Do you find yourself doing just that?
      If so, why is that attitude treading on very dangerous ground?

     Goodness Expressed
       While it cannot be said that we are saved by works, it can be said
     that, as blood-bought sons and daughters of God, we are saved in
     order that our lives might manifest good works. Jesus pointed out that
     as a tree is known by its fruit, we will be known by the kind of lives
     we live. Jesus carries the importance of good works a step further
     when He declares that those whose lives lack in good works will not
     be allowed to enter the kingdom of heaven (see Matt. 25:41–46).

Read Ephesians 2:10 and Titus 2:14. What common message exists
     in both these texts, and why is that message so important for any-
     one who professes the name of Christ?

        As human beings we are sinners; we have violated God’s law; we
     all need a Savior. But at the same time, we have been given promises
     in the Bible that if we surrender to Jesus, if we choose to live in the
     Spirit and not in the flesh, we can overcome and live a life that reflects
     the goodness of God. We can live in what Paul calls the “newness of
     life” (Rom. 6:4), because just as we have been by faith “buried with”
     Christ “by baptism into death” (vs. 4), we can “likewise reckon” our-
     selves “to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus
     Christ our Lord” (vs. 11).
        We can be “good” in the biblical sense of the word, not “good” as
     if we deserve salvation but “good” in the sense that our hearts, our
     motives, our deeds reveal to the world the reality of the God whom we
     profess to serve. Sure, it will take dying to self, it will take a willing-
     ness to serve others, it will take a daily struggle with the flesh, and it
     will take a humble heart of contrition and repentance when we fail,
     but we can and must live out the faith that we confess.

      How well are you availing yourself of all the promises of a vic-
      torious Christian life? What is holding you back from claiming
      what’s yours, what’s been offered to you at such a great price?

    Further Study: “It is not only by preaching the truth, not only by
         distributing literature, that we are to witness for God. Let us remem-
         ber that a Christlike life is the most powerful argument that can be
         advanced in favor of Christianity, and that a cheap Christian character
         works more harm in the world than the character of a worldling.”
         —Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 21.
           “The badge of Christianity is not an outward sign, not the wearing
         of a cross or a crown, but it is that which reveals the union of man
1        with God. By the power of His grace manifested in the transformation
         of character the world is to be convinced that God has sent His Son
         as its Redeemer. No other influence that can surround the human soul
         has such power as the influence of an unselfish life. The strongest
         argument in favor of the gospel is a loving and lovable Christian.”

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In class, read and discuss your answers to the question in
          Sunday’s study about how God has revealed to you His good-
          ness.

          l2 What are some practical ways in which we as individuals or as

3         a church can express and reveal the goodness of God to others?
          Is your church doing good in the community where it is located?
          If your church were to move, would the neighbors miss it?

          l3 The Bible says that God’s law is good. And we know that it is.
          How, though, can it be used as something bad? What are ways
          that the law can be misused, and what are the sad consequences
          of such a misuse?

          l
          4 Ponder this age-old philosophical question: Is something
          deemed good because God says it’s good? Or does God deem it
          good because it already is good?

          l
          5 In class, discuss Luke 18:18, 19. What was Jesus saying here?
          How are we to understand His words?

          l6 In class, stage a discussion. Have half the class argue the point
          that human beings are basically good at heart; let the other half
          take the position that humans are basically bad. Argue your
          positions, not from the Bible but from what you see in the world
          as a whole.

Turning Tragedy to Joy
An interview with Marlene and Enrique Tavares da Silva
   “We were devastated when we received word that our son, Emerson,
a medical student in Bolivia, was diagnosed with schizophrenia,” his
mother, Marlene, said. “We brought him back to Brazil and took him to
the best doctors, who confirmed that Emerson has the most serious type of
schizophrenia. The doctors explained that even with medicines, Emerson
never would lead a normal life.
   “Our son was a promising medical student, but now he can hardly
be left alone,” his father said. “He worries about us when we are gone,
even for a little while, and he doesn’t do well in public places. His life is
largely confined to home except for Sabbath morning when we take him
to church.”
   The couple had looked forward to a retirement filled with ministry, but
when Emerson became ill, Marlene took early retirement from her career
as a teacher to care for him. “I prayed that God would show me how He
could use our son’s illness to bring glory to His name,” Marlene said.
“And God has answered that prayer in marvelous ways.
   “Emerson has always loved God,” she adds. “He loved to lead out in
worship, and I decided to invite people into our home for small-group
worships and Bible study. Most of the people are doctors from the nearby
hospital; some are teachers, and others are neighbors. It’s working.
Emerson is blessed by these small gatherings, and we can reach out to
people who don’t know Christ. We’ve lost count of how many people
have been led to Christ through our small-group ministry.”
   “We know that God didn’t make my son sick. But He turned our trag-
edy into a blessing by giving us a ministry at home. Currently we host
two groups—one on Sabbath afternoon and one Monday night,” Enrique
says.
   Enrique prefers to let Marlene lead out in the Bible studies. He feels that
her years of teaching experience make this her special gift. He focuses on
making people feel welcome and contributing to the conversation.
   “People don’t stop coming once they are baptized,” Marlene explains.
“They continue to come and help lead out in the group. They bring their
friends who are having problems or who don’t know Christ. It’s a busy
and happy place.”
   Enrique and Marlene urge everyone to find a ministry that suits their
life and their talents. Small groups are an effective and important ministry
in many countries.

Marlene and Enrique Tavares da Silva share their faith in Belen, Brazil.

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Faithfulness


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 25:1–13; Luke 16:10;
     1 Thess. 5:23, 24; 2 Tim. 3:1–5; Hebrews 11.

Memory Text: “And let us not grow weary while doing good,
     for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart” (Galatians
     6:9, NKJV).



     T
            he fruit of the Spirit known as “faithfulness” could also be
            called “fidelity.” It speaks of endurance, a firmness of purpose,
            especially when the going is tough.
          Faithfulness implies steadfast adherence. Synonyms include loy-
     alty, implying undeviating allegiance; constancy, suggesting freedom
     from uncertainty; staunchness, implying such a strong allegiance to
     one’s principles or purposes that they cannot be turned aside; and
     resoluteness, stressing unwavering determination.
       “Faith” and “faithfulness,” though closely linked, are not the same
     thing. Faith is that indefinable power, a gift from God, through which
     we can believe in a reality that yet remains unseen. “Now faith is the
     substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (Heb.
     11:1). Faithfulness, in contrast, is the working out of this inner-belief
     system. When we have faith in God, we act in faithful ways. Acts of
     faithfulness are a demonstration of our faith, and such acts are the
     threads holding our belief and behavior system together.

     God Is Faithful
       							
       “O Lord God of hosts, Who is mighty like You, O Lord? Your
     faithfulness also surrounds You” (Ps. 89:8, NKJV).

       As with all the fruit of the Spirit, God Himself is the model we must
     study for examples of faithfulness. God is as faithful now as He was
     three trillion years before creating the earth. He will be just as faithful
     three trillion years into the future as He was when He set the decrees
     in eternity past. Nothing will deter Him or alter His course.

       Note some of the attributes of God’s faithfulness:

       • God’s faithfulness is far-reaching in its extent—“Your faithful-
         ness reaches to the clouds” (Ps. 36:5, NKJV).
       • God’s faithfulness is sure—“Nevertheless My lovingkindness I
         will not utterly take from him, nor allow My faithfulness to fail”
         (Ps. 89:33, NKJV).
       • God’s faithfulness is great—“Great is Your faithfulness” (Lam.
         3:23, NKJV).
       • God’s faithfulness is set in heaven—“For I have said, ‘Mercy
         shall be built up forever; Your faithfulness You shall establish in
         the very heavens’ ” (Ps. 89:2, NKJV).

Identify the blessings that come to us as a result of His faithful-
     ness:

     Faithlessness: A Sign of the End
Read Luke 18:8. What is implied in Jesus’ question here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The apostle Paul writes that “evil men and impostors will grow
     worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived” (2 Tim. 3:13,
     NKJV). People today are like what they were when Moses wrote the
     Pentateuch or Paul his epistles. One could argue, however, that our
     society today makes it easier to sin, that it all but encourages it. In
     other words, our environment grows ever more amenable to sin, and
     our fallen human natures naturally will take advantage of it. Self-
     centeredness constantly is promoted. Advertising hammers away at
     us to gratify ourselves: why wait, why deny ourselves, why sacrifice,
     why not go along with everyone else? Constantly we hear, “Indulge
     yourself because you deserve it” or the like.

Read 2 Timothy 3:1–5. What is the first characteristic found there?
     How do we find it so overtly manifested today?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       While this generation is hardly the first to be selfish, it is unique
     in that selfishness actually is recommended. “Look out for number
     one,” “Love yourself first,” is the cry. Self-centeredness has spawned
     another phenomenon, which is irresponsibility. This generation could
     well be the one of which it was written, “There is a generation that
     curses its father, and does not bless its mother. There is a generation
     that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filthiness”
     (Prov. 30:11, 12, NKJV). It would seem that everything wrong with
     everyone is now laid at the foot of someone else, most often the par-
     ents.

      How has the mass media contributed to unfaithfulness, even
      among church members? Be honest with yourself: how has
      it affected your thinking? Try to step back and ask yourself,
      How might the things I read, watch, and listen to be negatively
      affecting my own faithfulness to God?

Models of Faithfulness                     (Hebrews 11)

  Read Hebrews 11, the list of characters who are given as
examples of faithfulness. Pick three characters and write down
how their faithfulness was revealed, even amid struggles, trials,
and temptations. That is, what did they do that revealed their
faithfulness? At the same time, what were their struggles, their
trials, their temptations? More so, in what ways, however differ-
ent the variables, are the principles involved the same for us today
as they were for the characters in Hebrews?

  Think how easy it could have been for some of these people to have
become discouraged. Think of Joseph in the dungeon or Sarah wait-
ing and waiting and waiting for the promised child or Moses tempted
with the riches of a kingdom as opposed to suffering “affliction with
the people of God” (vs. 25). We sometimes tend to look at these
people as if they were larger than life, kind of superhuman, and yet,
they were just as real as we are, just as prone to sin, just as prone to
question and to fear and to fall. Despite all their own weaknesses and
mistakes, however, they showed faithfulness, they acted out the faith
they professed, and they were able to be used by God to do remark-
able things.

 What are the things that challenge you in your desire to be
 faithful? Put them into two categories: (1) the things you can
 do nothing about and (2) the things you can remove from your
 life.


                                                                    67

     Faithfulness in Daily Living
       “ ‘He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and
     he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much’ ” (Luke
     16:10, NKJV). How have you seen this principle manifested in your
     own life? After all, if we are not faithful in the little things, why
     should we think we would be in the larger ones?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       “The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who
     will not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true
     and honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men
     whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who
     will stand for the right though the heavens fall.”—Ellen G. White,
     Education, p. 57.

        The following words are some of the components of faithfulness:
        Dependability—Dependability means people can count on you.
     When was the last time someone let you down? Do you remember
     how that made you feel? What does it say about your character if you
     lack dependability?
        Honesty—Honesty is truthfulness. It means you are not going to
     lie or cheat or steal. Honesty is a cardinal building block of a strong
     character and should be in play every day of our lives.
        Integrity—Integrity is like a code of honor. If you have integrity,
     you have certain values and beliefs that you live by. It also means you
     respect the values and beliefs of others. Integrity is also one of the
     building blocks of character.
        Loyalty—Loyalty is allegiance. It means standing by someone
     even when times get tough. Loyalty is an important part of friendship.
     But does loyalty include doing something wrong for a friend? Does
     loyalty have limits? How might someone take a good thing, loyalty,
     too far?

      Take a closer look at these elements. How well do you fare
      in these different categories? Where can you do better? Most
      important, what changes do you need to make in order to be
      more faithful to what you know is right? How can you make
      the needed changes?

     Faithful Until the End
       Could it be that we are suffering another Great Disappointment?
     Not that we fixed another date for the coming of Jesus, but something
     just as real, if more subtle, and that is a diminished emphasis on the
     Second Coming, if for no other reason than that we expected it to have
     happened by now.

Read Matthew 25:1–13. Notice that everyone who was waiting for
     the bridegroom went to sleep. When the bridegroom finally
     arrived and all awakened, it was too late for five of them. In what
     ways could we, in the twenty-first century, be in danger of doing
     the same thing?

     ____________________________________________________________________

Read Matthew 24:44–50. Notice how the evil servant changes his
     lifestyle when he becomes convinced that his master is not coming
     back as soon as he had expected. What is the message to us who
     feel there has been a delay in the coming of Jesus?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Things have not happened as soon as we expected, but we take
     comfort from the promise in Galatians 6:9, “And let us not grow
     weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not
     lose heart” (NKJV).
       The issue that confronts God’s people in the twenty-first century is
     not “Will God be faithful?” We should know by now that He is faith-
     ful to all that He has promised. The crucial issue is, “Will I be faithful
     until the end?”

      In many ways the answer to the question about the future
      (“Will I be faithful to the end?”) can be found in the present.
      What is the basic trend of your spiritual life now? Are you daily
      committed to the Lord, growing in grace and faithfulness, or
      are you slowly, bit by bit, easing up, growing more accustomed
      to the world and its ways? What does your answer tell you
      about yourself and your walk with the Lord?

    Further Study: “But like the stars in the vast circuit of their
         appointed path, God’s purposes know no haste and no delay. Through
         the symbols of the great darkness and the smoking furnace, God had
         revealed to Abraham the bondage of Israel in Egypt, and had declared
         that the time of their sojourning should be four hundred years.
         ‘Afterward,’ He said, ‘shall they come out with great substance.’
         Gen. 15:14. Against that word, all the power of Pharaoh’s proud
         empire battled in vain. On ‘the self-same day’ appointed in the divine
         promise, ‘it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from
1
         the land of Egypt.’ Ex. 12:41. So in heaven’s council the hour for the
         coming of Christ had been determined. When the great clock of time
         pointed to that hour, Jesus was born in Bethlehem.”—Ellen G. White,
         The Desire of Ages, p. 32, emphasis supplied.

    Discussion Questions:
2         l
          1 What are some of the things in your own culture that present
          challenges to those who want to be faithful to Jesus? How can
          we meet those challenges? How can we help one another in this
          struggle?

          l2 Dwell on the things that you have read, watched, or listened
          to for the past twenty-four hours. Were they the kind of things
          that could encourage you in your faith, or were they things that
3         worked against it? What are the implications of your answer?

          l
          3 Look at the question of loyalty. In what contexts is loyalty
          good? Is it always good? When might being loyal to someone
          mean being disloyal to God?

          l
          4 What kind of danger, if any, could arise from being overtly
          obsessed with faithfulness? That is, in what ways could it be
          taken too far?

          l5 What are practical ways that we can keep alive in our
          churches and in our homes the reality of the Second Coming? It
          is true: The longer it takes, the easier and easier it gets to forget
          about it and fall into wrong habits and patterns of thought. How
          can we instill, especially in those who have been in the church a
          long time, the importance of keeping the reality and promise of
          the Second Coming passionately before us?

God Made a Way
by Benson Chilumpha
   I know firsthand that God is the answer when there is no answer. He
has guided me through many obstacles so that I could study at Malawi
Adventist College.
   I had been a primary school teacher for 14 years and wanted to return to
college to earn my bachelor’s degree in education. I had to retake my high
school leaving exams, and I scored high. But I was not offered admission
to attend the university. I took the tests again the following year and again
scored high. Again I was disappointed when I was not invited to enroll in
the university.
   Disappointed, I knelt and asked God, “Why me? Why am I overlooked
when others with lower scores have been admitted to college?” I heard
God whisper, “Wait. I have a plan.”
   So I waited. Then I learned that Malawi Adventist College was broad-
ening its degree program and would offer degrees in education and busi-
ness management. I applied. While I awaited word on my application,
I dreamed that I was sitting in a class. I could see the lecturer standing
before the class asking questions. Soon after this I received a call from my
pastor saying I had been accepted to study at the Adventist college.
   I was overjoyed. But I had no money for school fees. So I went back to
God. “God, you are the source of all answers,” I prayed. “You have given
me a place in this school, so now I turn to you to provide the school fees
I need.”
   I applied for a scholarship from a national organization in Malawi
and was accepted. The scholarship would pay half my fees. I knelt and
thanked God for providing this scholarship and asked where I should look
for the rest of my fees so that Satan would not triumph. After praying, I
remembered an organization that had helped me when I was in college 14
years earlier. I was not sure they would even get my letter, but I wrote, and
they responded in the affirmative. They would pay the remainder of my
school fees. God provided for my school fees, and I trust Him to provide
the money my family needs for food and clothes and the children’s school
fees. I can trust God, for, as you can see, He has not let me down.
   Part of a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping to build a women’s
dormitory at Malawi Adventist College, making it possible for more stu-
dents to receive a quality Christian education for service to the Master.
Thank you!

         Lesson             9      *February 20–26


     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Meekness


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 50:20; Matt. 5:5;
     11:29; Rom. 12:3; Gal. 6:1; Phil. 2:2, 3; 1 Pet. 3:4.

Memory Text: “ ‘Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
     earth’ ” (Matthew 5:5, NKJV).



     M
               eekness is a fruit of the Spirit that seems very much lost in
               our aggressive, self-centered culture. Because people associ-
               ate it with weakness, most do not admire others for being
     meek. Yet, it is what we are called to be.
        What is meekness? It’s an attitude of humility toward God and
     gentleness toward people—when we recognize that God is in control
     and that we can trust Him, even when things don’t go the way we
     would like, which is so often the case (Is it not?). To be meek, one
     needs confidence, not in oneself but in the Lord.
        Although weakness and meekness may look similar, they are not
     the same. Weakness is due to negative circumstances, such as lack of
     strength or lack of courage, hardly the words to describe Jesus, who
     said, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
     lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:29). Meekness, rather, is the result of a per-
     son’s conscious choice to trust in God and lean on Him, as opposed
     to pushing for one’s own ways. Thus, meekness arises out of strength,
     not weakness.

     Meek and Lowly in Heart
       “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
     and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls” (Matt.
     11:29). What is Jesus telling us here? How can being meek and
     lowly in heart bring rest to our souls?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Meekness is the absolute ceasing to fight for our agenda and believ-
     ing that God will fight on our behalf for His. Meekness is the opposite
     of self-assertiveness and self-interest. It stems from trust in God’s
     goodness and control over the situation. The meek person is not occu-
     pied with self (see Luke 22:42)—an attitude that’s key to the promise
     of finding rest for our souls. After all, aren’t our turmoil and agitation
     so often due to seeking only for ourselves and what we want? In the
     truest sense, then, a meek person is one who has learned to die to self,
     and that takes faith, courage, and perseverance, not necessarily traits
     the world would associate with meekness.

Read Romans 12:3. How is the idea of meekness represented here?
     In what ways is this the key to being meek?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Ephesians 4:2 is another text that helps us understand what meek-
     ness is. Notice how it’s related to Romans 12:3, in that both texts
     emphasize in their own way why arrogance and selfishness are con-
     trary to the Christian’s walk. After all, why should any Christian be
     arrogant about anything? Are we not all sinners? Would we all not be
     doomed to eternal destruction were it not for Jesus? Are we not all
     utterly dependent upon God for every breath, every heartbeat? Does
     not every gift and talent we have come from God? What then do we
     have to be proud about? Nothing! Indeed, considering all that it cost
     to save us, Christians should be the meekest and humblest folk on
     earth.

      Think about how utterly dependent you are upon God for
      everything. Where, then, does that pride and arrogance in your
      heart come from, and how can you get rid of it?

                                                                           73

     Models of Meekness
        Remember the crisis that Abraham faced in deciding with his
     nephew Lot how to divide up the land? (See Gen. 13:8, 9.) In view
     of the fact that God had promised to make of his descendants a great
     nation, what might have been Abraham’s justification in taking the
     best for himself? Instead, Abraham allowed Lot to choose first, saying
     that he would take what was left over. How was this action a charac-
     teristic of meekness?
        Most everyone knows the story of Joseph being sold as a slave into
     Egypt by his brothers. Read again the story of their coming to him,
     now second in command in all Egypt, and begging to be able to pur-
     chase food (Genesis 45). How did Joseph’s meekness determine how
     he treated his brothers? Had he not been meek, what would he prob-
     ably have done? How is Genesis 50:20 an example of the worldview
     of those who are meek?
        As a young man David had been anointed to be the next king of
     Israel. King Saul became insanely jealous and for years pursued
     David and his men with the intent to kill him. On two occasions David
     had an opportunity to kill Saul (1 Sam. 24:3–7, 26:7–12). If David
     had not been meek, what might have been his rationalization for kill-
     ing Saul? Why is it so easy for us to use a spiritual excuse for doing
     something that is in our own interest?
        In Numbers 12:3, Moses is described as the meekest man of his
     time. Yet, his decisive actions do not seem to fit the popular concept
     of meekness. His demand to Pharaoh to let Israel go was forceful and
     followed up with action. When Israel worshiped the golden calf, his
     “anger burned,” and before it was over he had taken the calf that they
     had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and made the chil-
     dren of Israel drink it (Exod. 32:19, 20). How are we to understand
     the meekness of Moses?
        Jesus, of course, is the greatest of all models of meekness (Matt.
     11:29). What are some of the examples of His meekness? How, for
     instance, was His meekness revealed in John 18:21–23? Or how
     about Matthew 26:39? At the same time, we find examples of Jesus
     doing things that don’t appear to be meek, such as when He drove
     the money changers out of the temple or all the times He confronted
     the Pharisees and others regarding their hypocrisy. How do these
     examples help us understand that meekness can be manifested in
     some very bold ways?

      What can you find in common among these examples of meek-
      ness? What can you learn from them that could help you under-
      stand what meekness is and isn’t?

The Importance of Meekness
  “Seek righteousness, seek humility. It may be that you will be hid-
den in the day of the Lord’s anger” (Zeph. 2:3, NKJV). Meekness is
the opposite of pride. There is much emphasis today on the impor-
tance of having self-esteem. When does self-esteem go over the edge
and become pride?
  Meekness is necessary for receiving God’s Word. “Receive
with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls”
(James 1:21, NKJV). A person who does not have a humble spirit
cannot receive God’s Word because there is a conflict of interest.
Why is this so?
  Meekness is necessary for effective witnessing. “But sanctify
the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense
to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with
meekness and fear” (1 Pet. 3:15, NKJV).
  “Our influence upon others depends not so much upon what we
say as upon what we are. Men may combat and defy our logic, they
may resist our appeals; but a life of disinterested [unselfish] love is an
argument they cannot gainsay. A consistent life, characterized by the
meekness of Christ, is a power in the world.”—Ellen G. White, The
Desire of Ages, p. 142.
  Meekness gives glory to God. First Peter 3:4 says, “even the orna-
ment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.”
  “It is right to love beauty and to desire it; but God desires us to
love and seek first the highest beauty, that which is imperishable. No
outward adorning can compare in value or loveliness with that ‘meek
and quiet spirit,’ the ‘fine linen, white and clean’ (Revelation 19:14),
which all the holy ones of earth will wear. This apparel will make
them beautiful and beloved here, and will hereafter be their badge of
admission to the palace of the King. His promise is, ‘They shall walk
with Me in white: for they are worthy.’ Revelation 3:4.”—Ellen G.
White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 523, 524.		

 How does putting emphasis on external beauty potentially con-
 flict with the development of the fruit of the Spirit, particularly
 with the fruit of meekness? As the fruit of meekness grows in
 you, how should your life be different from what it was before?
 In the area of meekness, what changes have you seen in your
 life since you’ve accepted Christ? What attitudes might you be
 harboring that make it difficult for you to be meek?

      Practicing the Fruit of Meekness
         Meekness will be manifested in how we relate to others. That is, it’s
      something that is active, something that will reveal itself in our words,
      attitudes, and actions. You might think that you are meek, but that doesn’t
      necessarily mean that you are. To be meek is to manifest meekness.

How do the following texts show us how meekness is to be revealed in
      our lives? Why is meekness so important in these situations?

      Matt. 5:39________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      Matt. 18:21, 22___________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         As we’ve been saying all along, meekness is wrongly associated
      with weakness. It is anything but. In fact, go back over the verses
      we’ve looked at today. Can you not see how it takes strength, moral
      and spiritual strength, to reveal meekness in most of these situa-
      tions?

       Of course, if meekness is a fruit of the Spirit, it’s something that
       comes to us from God and not from ourselves. Nevertheless,
       we need the daily surrender to the Lord, the daily willingness
       to obey in faith, in order for meekness to be made manifest in
       our lives.

     The Reward of the Meek
       E. D. Hulse said, “Humility is a strange thing. The minute you think
     you’ve got it, you’ve lost it.”
       A small town wanted to recognize and reward its meekest citizen.
     A survey was taken of their small community, which eventually
     identified the person. In a ceremony attended by all the important
     people, the meekest citizen was presented with a ribbon on which
     were inscribed the words, “The Meekest Man in Town.” However,
     the next day they had to take the ribbon away from him, because he
     was wearing it!

How do you understand the promises and rewards mentioned in the
     following texts?

     Ps. 22:26________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     Ps. 25:9_________________________________________________

     Isa. 29:19_______________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     Matt. 5:5________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

      These verses are comforting because there are times when the
      meek are taken advantage of. But we have learned in this study
      that a meek person isn’t concerned with lifting himself up before
      men but rather lifting God up. As a result, God promises to exalt
      the one who is meek. The rewards can be experienced now and,
      most surely, in the new heaven and new earth of eternity.

                                                                       77

    Further Study: “Christ is not to be hid away in the heart and
         locked in as a coveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely
         by the possessor. We are to have Christ in our hearts as a well of water,
         springing up into everlasting life, refreshing all who come in contact
         with us. We must confess Christ openly and bravely, exhibiting in our
         characters his meekness, humility, and love, till men shall be charmed
         by the beauty of holiness. It is not the best way to preserve our reli-
         gion as we bottle perfumes, lest the fragrance should escape.”—Ellen
         G. White, Counsels on Health, p. 400, emphasis supplied.
            “The peace of Christ, the peace of Christ—money cannot buy it,
1
         brilliant talent cannot command it, intellect cannot secure it; it is the
         gift of God. The religion of Christ—how shall I make all understand
         their great loss if they fail to carry its holy principles into the daily
         life? The meekness and lowliness of Christ is the Christian’s power.
         It is indeed more precious than all things which genius can create or
         wealth can buy. Of all things that are sought, cherished, and culti-
2
         vated, there is nothing so valuable in the sight of God as a pure heart,
         a disposition imbued with thankfulness and peace.”—Ellen G. White,
         Counsels on Health, p. 403, emphasis supplied.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 God promises to increase joy in the lives of those who are
          meek. Why do you think meek people can be joyful? Give several
3         reasons. How will cultivating the fruit of the Spirit that is meek-
          ness improve your everyday life?

          l
          2 What are ways in which meekness can be misconstrued as
          weakness?

          l
          3 All this talk about meekness raises an important question: are
          Christians never to stand up for their own rights? Do we allow
          ourselves to be doormats, constantly stepped on without doing
          anything in our own defense? Is there a balance here, and, if so,
          how do we find it?

          l4 Nietzsche argued that Christianity was a religion born from
          those who were weak, who didn’t have power, and thus who took
          traits such as humility and meekness and made them appear like
          something good, something to strive for. How would you respond
          to such an argument?

God’s Thousand Ways
by Junko Asanuma
   I live in Japan where fewer than 2 percent of the people profess any
form of Christianity. While studying at the university, I lived with my
parents and large family. We weren’t Christians, but we were happy.
   I met a young man at the university, and we began dating. One day he
invited me to attend a Christmas program at a church. He said he had been
studying the Bible with someone there, but I knew nothing about church
or about Christians.
   After we graduated from the university, he went on for further educa-
tion while I took a job in a private high school in another city. I got my
own apartment closer to the school, and I liked my work. But I missed
my family terribly. I spent my evenings surfing the Internet and e-mailing
my boyfriend.
   But we were too far apart to maintain a relationship. I was devastated
when we broke up. My life was so empty and lonely that sometimes I
thought of committing suicide. I often cried while talking to my friends,
so I stopped calling them.
   In the midst of my despair I remembered the church that my boyfriend
had invited me to attend. If God was real, as my former boyfriend said,
could God really save me? Could He help me solve my problems? I found
the little Seventh-day Adventist church my boyfriend had taken me to, and
with a heart heavy with burdens, I opened the church door.
   The pastor greeted me warmly and saw to it that I sat with a friendly
person. After church he invited me back and offered to study the Bible
with me and help me find the answers I was searching for. In the Adventist
church I discovered a world of hope and love. The pastor e-mailed me
often, answering my questions, sending me copies of sermons I had
missed and inspirational articles. My bruised heart began to heal. I felt a
new purpose, a new hope in life. I committed my life to God and accepted
His invitation to become His child through baptism.
   I praise God for finding ways to shed His love on my wounded heart. He
used so many different ways to show me His love: through the Internet,
friendly church members, Bible studies, and many others. I thank God
for the generosity of church members around the world who give mission
offerings liberally to lead me to Christ.

       Lesson             10 *February 27–March 5
     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Self-Control
       		




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Judges 13–16; 1 Cor.
     9:24–27; Phil. 4:8; Col. 3:1–10; Heb. 12:1, 2; 1 John 2:15, 16.

Memory Text: “But I discipline my body and bring it into
     subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should
     become disqualified” (1 Corinthians 9:27, NKJV).



     T
             hough listed last by Paul in Galatians 5:22, 23, “self-control”
             (sometimes translated “temperance”) is surely not the least of
             the fruit of the Spirit. It could easily have been first, because
     it plays a major role in the maturing of other spiritual fruit. It might
     be said that self-control is the glue that holds all the other qualities
     together.
        Like other fruit of the Spirit, self-control is a gift of grace. It has
     been called “disciplined grace”: grace because it is free, disciplined
     because there is something for us to do.
        Self-control may sound negative, but it is an integral part of grace
     itself. If we don’t control ourselves—our feelings, our appetites, our
     drives—then they control us. Thus, it’s either self-control under the
     grace and power of the Holy Spirit, or it’s being controlled by someone
     or something else. We, ultimately, decide.

     The Paradox of Self-Control (Phil. 2:12, 13)
       							
       Synonyms for self-control include self-discipline, strength of mind,
     and willpower. This fruit of the Spirit extends far beyond simply
     restraining Christians from doing what’s prohibited but includes
     enabling us to do what’s good.

First John 2:15, 16 admonishes us to stay away from three lusts.
     What are they, and, more important, how could they be mani-
     fested in our lives if we aren’t careful?

Philippians 4:8 lists items that should be the focuses of the
     Christian life. What are they, and how can doing what Paul says
     here protect us from the dangers listed in 1 John 2:15, 16?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        There are obviously dos and don’ts in the Christian life. There is
     a constant struggle with self, with the flesh, with the ways of the
     world. Paul shares this dilemma in Romans 7:15–18, when he talks
     about the struggle between what he knows he should do and what
     he’s tempted to do. However, in Romans 8:1, he gives us the answer:
     “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ
     Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the
     Spirit” (NKJV).
        He’s talking about walking in the Spirit. A life without the Spirit
     is incapable on its own of developing the fruit of the Spirit. Though
     we have the will, Paul speaks for all of us when he says that we don’t
     have the power. The answer to the dilemma of Romans 7 is not when
     can we overcome but how. And the how is found through faith in
     Jesus. We give ourselves to Jesus, we claim His righteousness, we are
     no longer condemned, and we surrender ourselves to Him and choose
     to walk in the Spirit, choose to follow His will, claiming His prom-
     ises of victory. The key is holding onto the promises; here’s where
     the power comes from. We cannot do it alone. We have to make the
     conscious choice to overcome in His name. The struggle is as much
     vertical (reaching up in faith) as it is horizontal (battling the clamors
     of the flesh). We need to do both.
                                                                          81

     Joseph and the Immediate Results
     of Righteousness
       Betrayed by his own family, sold into slavery, Joseph had very
     good reasons to doubt the love and care (even the existence) of the
     God that he had been taught about since childhood. That’s not, how-
     ever, what he did.

Read Genesis 39:7–20. In these verses, where do we find the key to
     why Joseph acted as he did?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

How was Joseph “rewarded” for his refusal to yield to temptation?
     Gen. 39:20. He was falsely accused and thrown into prison. Is that
     what he gets for being faithful?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        This is an important point to remember. Can we expect that our
     determination to do what is right, no matter the cost, will mean that
     things will turn out OK for us in the short term? What about folk
     who have lost their jobs, their spouses, their families, indeed, even
     their lives because they refused to compromise with sin? We have
     examples of this in the Bible, and perhaps you know people who have
     gone through something similar. Or perhaps you have gone through
     it yourself. In the end, suppose Joseph had spent the rest of his life
     rotting in jail? Had he still done the right thing?

      “For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption,
      but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting
      life” (Gal. 6:8, NKJV). What is this text telling us? What is
      placed in contrast to what? What is at stake? Why, then, is
      the issue here of paramount importance? How does what Paul
      writes here help us to understand why, no matter the immediate
      results, Joseph did right?

     Samson and the Fruits of Failure
       In Judges 13–16, the Bible gives us the story of Samson. Read
     through the texts (as much as time allows), keeping in mind the idea
     of self-control and temperance. There are plenty of powerful lessons
     we can learn from Samson’s example. How tragic that someone with
     so many gifts and so much promise could get so easily sidetracked.
       “Samson in his peril had the same source of strength as had Joseph.
     He could choose the right or the wrong as he pleased. But instead of
     taking hold of the strength of God, he permitted the wild passions of
     his nature to have full sway. The reasoning powers were perverted,
     the morals corrupted. God had called Samson to a position of great
     responsibility, honor, and usefulness; but he must first learn to govern
     by first learning to obey the laws of God. Joseph was a free moral
     agent. Good and evil were before him. He could choose the path of
     purity, holiness, and honor, or the path of immorality and degradation.
     He chose the right way, and God approved. Samson, under similar
     temptations, which he had brought upon himself, gave loose rein to
     passion. The path which he entered upon he found to end in shame,
     disaster, and death. What a contrast to the history of Joseph!”—Ellen
     G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 1007.

Read Judges 13:24, 25. Considering what we know about Samson,
     what important message, and warning, is found in those two
     texts?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Despite his great promise, Samson allowed his passions and lusts
     to overcome everything good. Who hasn’t struggled with the reality
     of this conflict? The great controversy isn’t just a symbol; it depicts
     the battle between Christ and Satan that is waged, not simply as some
     cosmic conflict in the heavens but in every human being, as well.
     Though Christ paved the way for all people to share in His victory,
     the battle for our hearts and flesh is being fought, indeed, in our hearts
     and our flesh. Sure, Christ won it all for us. But we have to choose
     to claim His victory all the time and, by the choices we make, we are
     deciding for one side or another in the great controversy.
       		
      How are you experiencing the reality of the great controversy in
      your own heart and flesh? What choices are you making? What
      do these choices tell you about which side you really are on?

     Paul’s Long Race
        “Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one
     receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. And
     everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things.
     Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imper-
     ishable crown. Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I
     fight: not as one who beats the air. But I discipline my body and
     bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I
     myself should become disqualified” (1 Cor. 9:24–27, NKJV).

        Read prayerfully and carefully Paul’s words here to the Corinthians.
     Notice how much in this he talks about himself and his struggles. We
     should find comfort in seeing that even a faithful Christian such as
     Paul, one of the true giants of faith, had to struggle with self, with sin,
     with the flesh. We are not alone in our battle. Heaven is going to be
     filled with people who knew the clamors of the flesh.

Based on the texts above, answer the following questions:

     • What analogy does Paul use to help us understand the battle
     with self and sin that we all struggle with? What are the crucial
     differences, though, between the analogy and the reality he’s
     referring to?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     • How confident was Paul regarding the race he was in? Where
     did his confidence come from? Why should we have the same
     confidence?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     • Though Paul shows confidence, he’s also aware of the possibility
     of failure. How does he describe it, and what is his solution? How
     does his answer fit in with the theme this week?

      How to Grow in Self-Control
         “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud
      of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so
      easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that
      is set before us” (Heb. 12:1, NKJV). Paul here again uses the race
      analogy that we saw earlier. What are some of the “weights” that
      you find are holding you back?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

Read Colossians 3:1–10. These verses give us rules for holy living as
      new persons in Christ. From these verses we learn several impor-
      tant things we must do to grow self-control in our lives. What do
      you find listed there, and how can you apply them to your own
      life and in a way that they will help get victory over the sin that
      so easily encumbers us?

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Every skill has to be practiced. Self-control doesn’t come in a day.
      It comes in hits and misses, in successes and failures, as we try to
      practice it day after day. “Fight the good fight of faith” (1 Tim. 6:12,
      NKJV); “Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but
      I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also
      laid hold of me” (Phil. 3:12, NKJV).
         Don’t constantly put yourself in places where your weaknesses will
      be tested, where your most-difficult-to-control drives will be out on
      the firing line of temptation. We must avoid even the appearance of
      evil (1 Thess. 5:22). “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no
      provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts” (Rom. 13:14).

       What are some areas of your life where self-control is definitely lack-
       ing? Why is it sometimes easier to get “victory” over dessert than to
       get victory over a spirit of bitterness and resentment? What changes
       can you make that will help you have more self-control?

                                                                           85

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Samson,” pp. 560–568, in
         Patriarchs and Prophets.

            “The divine promise to Manoah was in due time fulfilled in the birth
         of a son, to whom the name of Samson was given. As the boy grew up
         it became evident that he possessed extraordinary physical strength. This
         was not, however, as Samson and his parents well knew, dependent upon
1
         his well-knit sinews, but upon his condition as a Nazarite, of which his
         unshorn hair was a symbol. Had Samson obeyed the divine commands as
         faithfully as his parents had done, his would have been a nobler and hap-
         pier destiny. But association with idolaters corrupted him. The town of
         Zorah being near the country of the Philistines, Samson came to mingle
         with them on friendly terms. Thus in his youth intimacies sprang up, the
2
         influence of which darkened his whole life. A young woman dwelling
         in the Philistine town of Timnath engaged Samson’s affections, and
         he determined to make her his wife. To his God-fearing parents, who
         endeavored to dissuade him from his purpose, his only answer was, ‘She
         pleaseth me well.’ The parents at last yielded to his wishes, and the mar-
         riage took place.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 562.

    Discussion Questions:				
          l
          1 G. Gordon Liddy was one of the infamous Watergate conspira-
          tors. Liddy ended up serving more jail time than anyone else in
          this scandal, which rocked the United States in the 1970s. One
          time, when trying to recruit a young woman for criminal activity,
          Liddy invited her to a restaurant. During the discussion, she asked
          how she could trust him; that is, suppose he were caught, how
          could she know that he would not turn her in? In order to prove to
          her his self-control, Liddy placed his finger over a lit candle at the
          table, and held it there long enough for his flesh to start burning
          before he removed it. His point was to show her just how much
          self-control he had. How does that kind of self-control compare
          with the fruit of the Spirit we have looked at this week? Can we
          find something noble and worth emulating in that kind of self-
          control? Are self-control and discipline always necessarily good?

          l2 In what ways might self-control become a means to fanati-
          cism? How could we avoid the danger of making self-control a
          form of legalism?

          l
          3 Do you know someone who is suffering because of principle;
          that is, when tempted, they exhibited self-control like Joseph
          did and are now suffering some difficult consequences? How
          can you, either as a class or as an individual, help this person
          through his or her difficult time?

My Brother’s Prayer
by U. K. Rao
   I live in a village on the eastern coast of India. As a teenager I got involved
with a gang and began drinking. The gang was known for its violence and
law breaking, but I stayed away from those activities.
   My younger brother, Simon, isn’t like me. He has a heart for God. Even
though our village doesn’t tolerate Christians, my younger brother became
a Christian. This caused trouble in my family, and my parents sent him
away.
   One night I was at home drinking when Simon sneaked into the house.
He came into my room and began praying. I remember saying, “Brother,
pray for me.” And he did. As he prayed for me, I felt the desire for alcohol
leave my body. “What power is in you that when you pray to your God, I
become sober?” I asked him.
   “God has told me to pray for you,” Simon answered. “His power will
help you.” He invited me to attend church with him, and I agreed to go.
On Saturday morning I heard a voice so real that I turned to see who was
talking. The voice said, “Go to the church.” I started toward the church
when I met some of the gang members and invited them to come with me.
They laughed and made fun of Jesus. But I was determined to go.
   My brother’s prayers were changing me. Whenever I craved alcohol,
that voice whispered, “Simon is praying for you; Jesus can deliver you.”
Soon I was alcohol free, and six months later I was baptized.
   My conversion stirred up people in my village. Some wanted to learn
about God, but others were furious. Non-Christians don’t want Christians
near them. They wouldn’t let them draw water from the well or even
breathe the same air. New believers were fined or forced to leave the vil-
lage. I was warned not to talk about God or Jesus to other villagers.
   Then the lay evangelist who was working with the new believers in our
village suddenly died. The field president asked me to prepare to take his
place. People who knew my background of drinking and gangs wondered
at the change in me. I told them that the living God saved me and took
away my desire to drink.
   Because they saw the change in my life, some listened and began to
worship with us. Now we have 50 people worshiping in a small room each
Sabbath. These people want God’s power in their lives. And my greatest
joy is to lead them to Jesus.

     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Righteousness


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 23:25–28, Rom.
     3:28, 8:4, 10:3, Gal. 3:6, 1 John 2:3–6, 5:1–3.

Memory Text: “ ‘Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for
     righteousness, for they shall be filled’ ” (Matthew 5:6, NKJV).



     L
             ast week we finished our study on nine branches of the fruit of
             the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23). The next two weeks we will study
             two more: “for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righ-
     teousness, and truth” (Eph. 5:9, NKJV). In this verse, Paul repeats the
     reference to “goodness” while he adds righteousness and truth. This
     week we look at what this “righteousness” is.
        We understand righteousness in two ways. First, there is the imputed
     righteousness of Christ, which is what Jesus has done for us, the righ-
     teousness that covers us and that is our title to heaven. Second, there
     is the imparted righteousness of Christ, which is what He does in us,
     through the Holy Spirit, to mold us into His image. Thus understood,
     righteousness has two inseparable components, even though it’s all
     really one righteousness—the righteousness of Christ, without which
     we would have no hope of salvation.

     The Necessity of Righteousness
       “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
     the deeds of the law” (Rom. 3:28). “For the Lord is righteous, He
     loves righteousness; His countenance beholds the upright” (Ps. 11:7,
     NKJV). “The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but
     He loves him who follows righteousness” (Prov. 15:9, NKJV). “Who
     Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having
     died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were
     healed” (1 Pet. 2:24, NKJV). “That the righteous requirement of the
     law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but
     according to the Spirit” (Rom. 8:4, NKJV). “ ‘But seek first the king-
     dom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added
     to you’ ” (Matt. 6:33, NKJV). “If you know that He is righteous, you
     know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him”
     (1 John 2:29, NKJV).

Referring to the texts quoted above, respond to the following ques-
     tions:

     If we cannot be justified by the law, how then are we justified?

     _______________________________________________________

     Although we know that God hates sin but loves sinners, what
     wrong conclusions must we avoid?

     _______________________________________________________
     		
     What does “that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in
     us” mean? Can we ever keep the law well enough to fulfill it? Or
     does Paul mean something else? If so, what?

     _______________________________________________________

     How should our lives be changed when we seek first the kingdom
     of God and His righteousness?

     What does it mean “to do righteousness”? Can we be righteous

     Do-It-Yourself Righteousness
       “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to
     establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righ-
     teousness of God” (Rom. 10:3, NKJV). What do you think Paul was
     writing about here? About whom was he writing, and how might these
     folk have tried to establish their “own righteousness”? Given human
     nature, why is that impossible anyway?
     ____________________________________________________________________

        A “do-it-yourself” activity is one in which a person does or makes
     something (as in woodworking or home repair) without professional
     training or assistance. In its broadest sense it is an activity in which
     one does something oneself or on one’s own initiative. We sometimes
     refer to a particularly successful person as a self-made man or woman.
     According to the Bible, however, a “do-it-yourself” approach to true
     righteousness is impossible. There is nothing that we can do of our-
     selves, no matter how hard we try, to be righteous before God. Our
     righteousness is as “filthy rags” (Isa. 64:6). In fact, seeking to make
     ourselves righteous often leads to the opposite result.

Read Matthew 5:20 and 23:25–28. How does Jesus here pinpoint
     the problem that comes from those who seek to make themselves
     righteous?

        The crucial thing for Christians to understand is how utterly depen-
     dent they are upon Christ for their righteousness. What makes them
     holy before God is what Christ has done for them, not what they do.
     The moment someone loses sight of that truth, it’s so easy for self-
     righteousness to rise up, along with pride and inner corruption. The
     scribes and Pharisees were prime examples of how that happens. So
     concerned with their outward deeds of piety, they lost sight of what
     really matters.

      In what ways might you be guilty of the same sin as the scribes
      and Pharisees? How might this trap be more subtle than we
      think?

      Christ Our Righteousness (Rom. 5:17)
Read Romans 5:17–19 and summarize in your own words what Paul
      is saying here. How are we condemned, and how do we become
      righteous?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

If the righteousness of Jesus is a gift, how do we obtain it? Gal. 3:6,
      James 2:23.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         In Romans 5:19, notice the emphasis on disobedience and on obedi-
      ence. One man’s disobedience, Adam’s, led to all of us becoming sin-
      ners. This is basic biblical teaching. Adam’s sin brought the downfall
      of the human race. We’re all, each of us, every day of our lives, living
      with the results. No one is immune.
         The same verse, however, also talks about obedience. Whose
      obedience? Of course, the obedience of Christ, who alone has the
      righteousness needed for salvation, the righteousness given to all
      those who will “receive the abundance of grace.” Indeed, in that
      same verse Paul says that those who receive this grace get “the gift of
      righteousness.” Notice, it is a gift. As a gift it must be unearned and
      be undeserved. The moment it’s earned, or deserved, it’s no longer
      grace (Rom. 4:4).
         Yet, it’s not a blanket gift. The righteousness of Christ isn’t auto-
      matically bestowed on everyone (Rom. 5:17, NASB). Paul is clear. It
      comes to those who will receive it; that is, it is given to those who
      claim it by faith—such as Abraham, who believed God, and it was
      “accounted to him for righteousness” (Gal. 3:6).

       Do you really understand what it means to be saved by faith?
       How well do you grasp the idea that it’s only the righteous-
       ness of Jesus, credited to you by faith, that allows you to stand
       righteous and justified before God? What can you do to better
       grasp this wonderful provision, the foundation of the gospel?
                                                                          91

      Righteousness and Obedience (1 John 2:29)
      Though we are covered by the righteousness of Christ, that righ-
   teousness must be revealed in our lives. Righteousness isn’t just a
   legal declaration. It also becomes a reality in the life of the person
   who has it.
      How carefully we should heed John’s words: “Little children, let no
   man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he
   is righteous” (1 John 3:7).
      		
What might we be deceived about in regard to what it means to be
   righteous?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Righteousness is the fruit of the Spirit that is connected to obedience. To
      some people, obedience is inconsistent with salvation by faith. On occasion
      one might hear, “Now that you have accepted Jesus as your Savior, won’t
      you accept Him as the Lord of your life?” The implication seems to be
      that our obedience to the will of God and our salvation are separate issues.
      That’s a radical misinterpretation of what salvation is. John wrote that liv-
      ing a righteous life is a verifiable indicator of those who have salvation.

Read 1 John 2:3–6. What’s John’s point there?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         When the subject of obedience is raised, it is not unusual for someone
      to point out that we are not saved by works. While there can be no doubt
      that Lucifer’s obedience to the will of God did not put him into heaven,
      we must bear in mind that it was his disobedience that caused him to be
      expelled. The same can be said for Adam and Eve. Their obedience did
      not put them into the Garden of Eden, but their disobedience to the will
      of God resulted in their being put out of the garden.
         “Righteousness is right doing, and it is by their deeds that all will
      be judged. Our characters are revealed by what we do. The works
      show whether the faith is genuine.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object
      Lessons, p. 312.

       How well do you manifest the fruit of righteousness in your life?
       What practices might you need to give up that are hindering
       the fruit of righteousness in your life? (Be careful not to try to
       rationalize them away!)

      The Righteous Life
        “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
      and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
      begotten of him. By this we know that we love the children of God,
      when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the
      love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his command-
      ments are not grievous” (1 John 5:1–3).

How does John tie in the love of God with the love other fellow believ-
      ers have and with keeping the commandments? Why would he
      link all these together?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         “The man who attempts to keep the commandments of God from
      a sense of obligation merely—because he is required to do so—will
      never enter into the joy of obedience. He does not obey. When the
      requirements of God are accounted a burden because they cut across
      human inclination, we may know that the life is not a Christian life.
      True obedience is the outworking of a principle within. It springs
      from the love of righteousness, the love of the law of God. The
      essence of all righteousness is loyalty to our Redeemer. This will lead
      us to do right because it is right—because right doing is pleasing to
      God.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 97, 98, empha-
      sis provided.
         And what better way to inspire a desire to be loyal to God than
      through contemplation of His incredible sacrifice in our behalf on the
      cross? There’s no power in telling people that they have to keep the
      law. The power comes in pointing people to Jesus and to His substi-
      tutionary death in our behalf. The power comes from letting sinners
      know that their sins can be forgiven through Jesus, and they can stand
      perfect before God in the robe of Christ’s righteousness.
         Love of God, and not the fear of hell and condemnation, should be
      the power that motivates our lives, and nothing will cause us to love
      God more than focusing on the Cross and the riches and promises that
      are ours through it.

       Do you really love God? If so, how do you know? (Might you
       be deceiving yourself?) What do you do or say that reveals the
       reality of this love? In other words, what evidence is there that
       this love is real?
                                                                         93

    Further Study: “It is not enough for us to believe that Jesus is not
          an impostor, and that the religion of the Bible is no cunningly devised
          fable. We may believe that the name of Jesus is the only name under
          heaven whereby man may be saved, and yet we may not through
          faith make Him our personal Saviour. It is not enough to believe the
          theory of truth. It is not enough to make a profession of faith in Christ
          and have our names registered on the church roll. ‘He that keepeth
          His commandments dwelleth in Him, and He in him. And hereby we
1
          know that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath given us.’
          ‘Hereby we do know that we know Him if we keep His command-
          ments.’ 1 John 3:24; 2:3. This is the genuine evidence of conver-
          sion. Whatever our profession, it amounts to nothing unless Christ
          is revealed in works of righteousness.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s
          Object Lessons, pp. 312, 313.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 How can we avoid the trap of legalism, that of thinking that
           our works will save us or that of cheap grace, thinking that our
           works have nothing at all to do with our salvation? How do we
           strike the right balance here? Which ditch do you tend to lean
           more toward, cheap grace or legalism?
3
           l
           2 What is the inherent danger of having our lives driven by the
           desire to do good works? What can this lead to, and how can we
           avoid it?

           l
           3 Think of a person you know who seems to be “righteous.”
           What is this person like? How does he or she act? How does he
           or she treat people? What does this person talk about? What can
           you learn from this person?

           l4 We tend to think of righteousness in individual terms, which
           is correct. But is there not a community element, as well? Can
           our church community be “righteous”? If so, how? What would
           a “righteous” church community look like? How does yours
           compare with the ideal that you’ve come up with?

           l
           5 If salvation by faith means more than merely making a pro-
           fession of faith in Christ and having our names registered on the
           church roll, then what does it really mean? What is “faith” in the
           biblical sense of the term?

A Child’s Song
by Maye Porter
   Asap peeked into the hospital ward in her hometown of Kavieng, Papua
New Guinea. The doctor wasn’t there, so she slipped inside. She knew
that the doctor didn’t want her to be around sick people, but Asap was
on a mission. The patients looked so sad, and she wished she could do
something to cheer them up.
   Sing! A voice seemed to whisper. So Asap walked from bed to bed
singing songs she had learned in Sabbath School.
   One old man, Salatiel, smiled as Asap approached his bed. “What
church do you attend, Girlie,” he asked teasingly.
   “The Adventist church,” she answered.
   “What day do you attend church?” he asked.
   “On Sabbath, the seventh day,” she said innocently.
   Her simple answer surprised him. He gave her his Bible and said,
“Show me a verse that says that Saturday is the Sabbath.”
   Five-year-old Asap couldn’t read, but she opened the Bible and pointed
to a verse. “Here,” she said to the man. “Read this.”
   Salatiel read the verse Asap had pointed to. He blinked and read it
again. “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord” (Exod. 20:10).
   “Go get your father,” he told Asap. “Hurry!”
   Asap scampered from the hospital and soon returned with her father. “I
want you to see this miracle,” Salatiel said, pointing to the verse Asap had
shown him. “Surely the Sabbath is the Lord’s day of worship!” he said.
   Asap’s father studied the Bible with Salatiel, and by the time the old man
was well enough to return to his village, he had accepted many new Bible
truths. “How am I going to explain this to my pastor and others in my vil-
lage?” Salatiel asked. Asap’s pastor offered to go with him to help him.
   Many people listened as Salatiel and the pastor explained the Sabbath
and other Bible truths, and soon several asked to be baptized. The pas-
tor invited Asap and her family to attend the baptism, and when it was
Salatiel’s turn to be baptized in the sea, little Asap took his hand and led
him to the water. Today a new group of believers worship in a little bam-
boo church in their village—all because a little girl obeyed when the Holy
Spirit whispered, “Sing!”
   Someone needs your help to find the Savior today. And every day your
mission offerings help to share your faith with people you may never
meet.

Maye Porter and her pastor-husband have served as missionaries throughout the South
Pacific Division. Currently they share their faith on Norfolk Island, off the coast of eastern
Australia.

       Lesson             12 *March 13–19
     The Fruit of the Spirit Is
     Truth
										




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Chron. 25:2; Ps. 51:17;
     Jer. 29:13; John 7:16, 17; 14:6; 17:3; Heb. 5:14.

Memory Text: “And you will seek Me and find Me, when you
     search for Me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:13, NKJV).



     T
            he Greek word for truth, aletheia, has two meanings. One is
            objective truth (actual facts, verity, or principle), and the other
            is subjective truth (truth as a personal excellence—a candor of
     mind that is free from affectation, pretense, dissimulation, falsehood,
     and deceit). Truth, then, is what we know, the objective “facts on the
     ground,” as it were. But there’s the subjective element of truth, as well,
     which entails how we individually respond to what we learn. When
     both of these are real in our lives, we will manifest truth as a fruit of
     the Spirit.
       That’s why both elements are crucial to the Christian walk. We need
     to know the basic objective truth as it is found in Jesus, and then we
     need the personal subjective experience of having our lives changed
     by that truth.
       Look at Judas. He was with Jesus for more than three and a half
     years. Judas had all sorts of truth revealed to him. He saw things the
     rest of us only can read about. And yet, in the end, look what good it
     did him.
       May we all take heed.

     “I Am . . . the Truth”
       “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No
     one comes to the Father except through Me’ ” (John 14:6, NKJV).
     Write out a short paragraph explaining what you think this text
     means.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        On one level, this text radically challenges the relativism (the idea
     that truth is only subjective and personal) so current in much of the
     world today. Jesus’ words leave no ambiguity: There’s none of this
     “Each finds his own path to God,” and so forth. With these words,
     Jesus establishes the reality of objective truth. Here is Truth. Period.
     Few verses in the whole Bible are more contrary to the sentiment of
     relativism than this.
        At the same time, there’s a whole other element, as well. The Truth
     is a Person. You come to truth through a relationship with a Person.
     This is a radically different idea from the notion of truth being only a
     group of facts. Jesus, a human being, is the Truth; thus, if you want to
     know truth, you have to know Jesus.

How does what’s written above help us understand Christ’s words
     in John 17:3?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       We have to be careful, however, with this notion that all our religion
     means is having a relationship with God. Everyone lives in a relation-
     ship with God, one way or another. Folk who deny His existence live
     in relationship with God. Pilate had a relationship with Jesus; so did
     Caiaphas. Even the devil has a relationship with Jesus—he hates Him.
     The gospel is not a call to have a relationship with Jesus but to make a
     commitment to Him. Nicodemus, for instance, had a relationship with
     Jesus, one in which he eventually committed his life and all that he
     had to Christ. That’s the kind we all need!

      No question, you have a relationship with Jesus. The questions
      you need to ask yourself are, What kind do I have? And, How
      can I make it better?
                                                                         97

     The Spirit and Truth
       “ ‘However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will
     guide you into all truth’ ” (John 16:13, NJKV).

        In view of what we learned yesterday, it is obvious that the work
     of the Holy Spirit is to point us to Christ and to help us abide in Him.
     “ ‘But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the
     Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will tes-
     tify of Me’ ” (John 15:26, NKJV).
        Look at this powerful insight: “The preaching of the word will be
     of no avail without the continual presence and aid of the Holy Spirit.
     This is the only effectual teacher of divine truth. Only when the truth is
     accompanied to the heart by the Spirit will it quicken the conscience or
     transform the life. One might be able to present the letter of the word
     of God, he might be familiar with all its commands and promises; but
     unless the Holy Spirit sets home the truth, no souls will fall on the Rock
     and be broken.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 671, 672.

What emphasis is Ellen G. White placing on the work of the Holy
     Spirit here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       What we see in the work of the Holy Spirit is both the objective
     and subjective aspect of Truth. The Spirit comes, and He testifies of
     Jesus and reproves “ ‘the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of
     judgment’ ” (John 16:8). These are hard facts about the world, about
     God, about reality.
       At the same time, the work of the Holy Spirit doesn’t end simply
     with teaching us these truths. Our lives need to be changed by our
     understanding of them. These objective and eternal truths will do us
     no good unless our lives are transformed by them, and part of that
     process (perhaps even the most important part) is for us, as she wrote,
     to be broken on the Rock (see Ps. 51:17).

      How were you broken (or were you ever)? What happened?
      What changes came? What did you learn about life, about suf-
      fering, about God from that experience? What other lessons
      might you still need to learn?

     “With All Your Heart”
       “And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me
     with all your heart” (Jer. 29:13, NKJV).

        “With all your heart” means “sincerely,” true in word and act. The word
     sincere comes from two Latin words—sine (without) and cera (wax).
     Apparently in the past, less-than-honest sculptors would secretly fix the
     flaws and cracks in their work by plugging them with wax, which, of
     course, doesn’t hold. Hence, sincerity means being real and genuine, not
     artificial. It means speaking or acting “from the heart” and meaning it.

Read 2 Chronicles 25:2. What is that text saying? What important
     point is being made about what’s inside us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Hebrew word translated in some versions as “perfect” comes
     from the root slm (from which shalom is derived). It means, basically,
     “full,” “complete,” or “at peace.” Thus, we have here a king who did
     the right thing but not with a heart that was in the right place. He
     wasn’t sincere in his actions. This raises the possibility that a person
     could be doing the right things for the wrong reasons. Though we may
     be able to fool some of the people some of the time, and ourselves
     all the time, we can’t fool God any of the time. How interesting that
     when David prayed for his son, the first thing he wanted him to have
     was “a perfect heart” (1 Chron. 29:19, NASB).
        Sincerity is important because the one who isn’t sincere, the one
     whose heart isn’t committed to what’s true and right, is someone with a
     divided heart. There surely is something else pulling on such a person,
     and as long as he or she doesn’t let go, as long as this person still allows
     those other allegiances a place, the heart cannot be slm, complete, or
     perfect before God. The key, then, is complete surrender to the Lord,
     a complete letting go of self. It’s not easy; in a real sense, to have that
     happen, you need to be, as we saw yesterday, broken on the Rock.

      How sincere are you in your faith? We’re not talking about occa-
      sional doubts, or having deep unanswered questions (everyone
      at times has doubts, and all have deep unanswered questions),
      nor are we talking about struggling with sin. Instead, we’re
      talking about your heart. Is it fully committed to God, “com-
      plete” before Him, or is it divided between God and something
      of the world? If it is the latter, what choices must you make?
                                                                             99

      A Conscience Seared
        Last week we saw how Jesus had sharp words for the fake “righ-
      teousness” of the scribes and the Pharisees (see Matt. 23:27), call-
      ing them “hypocrites.” The word hypocrite in the original language
      (hupokrites) means “actor.” Jesus was letting them know that He
      could discern their inner feelings and secret sins. It was as though
      He was telling them, “You act one way but inside you are another,
      as though you were acting in a play. Cannot you be real?” Another
      time Jesus said, “ ‘Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is
      written: “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far
      from Me” ’ ” (Mark 7:6, NKJV). His meaning is obvious.

Read 1 Timothy 4:2 and Titus 1:15. What important point is Paul
      talking about here? Our conscience is the place where the Holy
      Spirit makes contact with us. What can happen to us if we con-
      stantly are doing wrong?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        No question, the more we continue in evil, and the more we do what
      we know is wrong, the more defiled our conscience becomes and the
      further from the Truth we get. Again, you can have more than enough
      head knowledge to be saved. The final fires will, unfortunately, have
      way too many folk who knew more than enough objective truths to be
      saved. But, as we are saying, objective truth alone is not a fruit of the
      Spirit. Truth lived out in our life, that’s the fruit we need to bear.

Read Hebrews 5:14 and John 7:16, 17. How do these texts help us
      better understand the idea of truth as a fruit of the Spirit?

       What’s your own experience of a “seared conscience”? How
       long did it take until the act that had, at first, seared your con-
       science barely touched it at all? Why did that happen, and why
       is it so spiritually dangerous?

Walking in Truth
  “I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children
walking in truth, as we received commandment from the
Father” (2 John 4, NKJV). “If we say that we have fellowship
with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the
truth” (1 John 1:6, NKJV). What important point is being made
in both these texts regarding what it means to have a saving
relationship with Jesus?

   Truth, as a fruit of the Spirit, isn’t just what we know—it’s what we
do. Living in God’s light means more than just knowledge. Look at
how John explains what walking in darkness is like: “He that saith he
is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He
that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion
of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and
walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
darkness hath blinded his eyes” (1 John 2:9–11).
   Thus, walking in the light, walking in the truth, is more than just
keeping the Ten Commandments, at least according to the letter of the
law. In the end, when all is said and done, isn’t living in the truth basi-
cally manifested by how we deal with people and how we treat them?
If we are sharp, cross, unforgiving, vengeful, hateful, unsympathetic;
if we treat people as means rather than as ends, if we are trampling
upon others in an attempt to advance ourselves, then we are walking
in darkness, no matter how strictly we keep the Sabbath, no matter
how faithfully we adhere to the health message, no matter how much
we profess faith in Jesus, pay tithe, and go to church. In one sense, it’s
often a lot easier to learn correct doctrine and theology than it is to be
kind, selfless, and giving to others, is it not?

 Think about your interactions with folk in the past twenty-
 four hours. How have you treated them? What kind of words
 did you use? How comfortable would you be if your attitudes
 and actions toward them were made public (one day they will;
 see Matt. 10:26). What does your answer tell you about what
 changes you need to see made in your life?

                                                                      101

    Further Study: “It is not the length of time we labor but our will-
          ingness and fidelity in the work that makes it acceptable to God. In
          all our service a full surrender of self is demanded. The smallest duty
          done in sincerity and self-forgetfulness is more pleasing to God than
          the greatest work when marred with self-seeking. He looks to see how
          much of the spirit of Christ we cherish, and how much of the likeness
          of Christ our work reveals. He regards more the love and faithful-
          ness with which we work than the amount we do.”—Ellen G. White,
          Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 402, emphasis supplied.
             “The service rendered in sincerity of heart has great recompense.
1         ‘Thy Father which seeth in secret Himself shall reward thee openly.’
          By the life we live through the grace of Christ, the character is
          formed. The original loveliness begins to be restored to the soul. The
          attributes of the character of Christ are imparted, and the image of
          the Divine begins to shine forth. The faces of men and women who
          walk and work with God express the peace of heaven. They are sur-
2         rounded with the atmosphere of heaven. For these souls the kingdom
          of God has begun. They have Christ’s joy, the joy of being a blessing
          to humanity. They have the honor of being accepted for the Master’s
          use; they are trusted to do His work in His name.”—Ellen G. White,
          The Adventist Home, p. 535.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Is there any sense at all in which truth could be relative; that
3
           is, it may not apply all the time to every situation? If not, why
           not? Are there certain truths, perhaps, that could be relative
           while others aren’t?

           l
           2 Dwell more on this idea of what it means to be sincere in your
           faith. However crucial sincerity is, why is that not enough? After
           all, folk who strap bombs to themselves and blow themselves up
           are, it would seem, sincere. What else is needed?

           l
           3 Why is spending time in the Word so important if truth is
           more than head knowledge? What are ways in which we can
           learn to study our Bible so that the Truth in there can impact
           and change our lives for the better?

           l
           4 How can you help someone whose conscience has been so
           hardened in sin that they don’t feel their need of help?

           l
           5 In class, discuss this question: What’s better, to do the right
           thing for the wrong reason or the wrong thing for the right rea-
           son?

In Difficult Times: Part 1
by Richard Lasu
   My partner and I arrived in Kajo Keji, a small town in southern Sudan,
to plant a church. We knew no one and had no place to stay, so we prayed
for God’s leading.
   We found a Protestant pastor’s home, and he invited us to stay with
him that night. The next day was Sabbath, and we spent time explaining
to the pastor who we were and what we believe. He invited us to preach
in his church the next day, which is a custom in our region. We gladly
accepted.
   We chose to speak on the Second Coming, for we knew the people
would rejoice to be reminded that Jesus is coming again. After church
many of the members stopped by the pastor’s house where we were
staying to visit with us. The next morning we thanked the pastor for his
hospitality and went in search of a hut in which to live.
   We met a woman in town who said that she had been at church on
Sunday. When we told her that we were looking for a place to stay, she
suggested that her husband had several huts he wasn’t using and was will-
ing to introduce us to him. Her husband agreed to give us a hut at no cost
because we were pastors. We thanked the couple and moved in.
   That evening the woman gathered her neighbors at the hut to worship
with us. For three days we worshiped with these neighbors in the morn-
ing and again in the evening. But the woman’s husband lost interest and
stopped coming.
   The next evening as I sat in the hut, I heard feet running on the dirt path.
Suddenly our landlord burst into the hut with a gun. “Why are you making
my hut a place for worship?” he demanded.
   Before I could answer the man, his wife, who had heard the shout-
ing, ran to my hut. Then a soldier entered and pointed his gun at me. He
thought I was robbing the man, and he tried to stab me. The landlord’s
wife cried out, and the soldier realized his mistake.
   The landlord ordered us to leave his compound and threw our things
outside. We picked up our things and wondered where to go. It was ten
o’clock at night, and we had no place to go. Soldiers had imposed a cur-
few, and it was dangerous to be out. We didn’t know what to do.

      The Fruit of the Spirit: The
      Essence of Christian
      Character

      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 6:33, John 15:8,
      Rom. 3:20–26, 14:17, 1 Tim. 6:11, 1 John 2:15.

Memory Text: “To them God willed to make known what are
      the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is
      Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27, NKJV).



      W
                 hen Moses asked God to show him His glory, it was then
                 that the Lord revealed to him His character as merciful,
                 gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth
      (Exod. 34:6). And so when “we all, with open face beholding as in
      a glass the glory of the Lord, [we] are changed into the same image
      from glory [character] to glory [character], even as by the Spirit of the
      Lord” (2 Cor. 3:18).
        “By believing in Christ, the fallen race he has redeemed may obtain
      that faith which works by love and purifies the soul from all defile-
      ment. Then Christlike attributes appear: for by beholding Christ men
      become changed into the same image from glory to glory, from char-
      acter to character. Good fruit is produced. The character is fashioned
      after the divine similitude, and integrity, uprightness, and true benevo-
      lence are manifested.”—Ellen G. White, My Life Today, p. 54.

     Seek First the Kingdom of God		

        So often our prayers are more about what we can get as opposed
     to what we should become. Think about your own prayers, or about
     the prayers that you hear others pray. No matter how legitimate the
     concerns are, what category do most of them fall under: What can I
     get, or what can I become? How do we understand this tendency in
     light of what Jesus says to us below?

       “ ‘But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and
     all these things shall be added to you’ ” (Matt. 6:33, NKJV). What
     does Jesus mean when He tells us to seek “first” the kingdom of
     God? Why seek that first? See Matt. 16:26.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

How does Romans 14:17 help us understand what the kingdom of
     God is?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Notice that righteousness, peace, and joy are the fruit of the Spirit.
     Therefore, we should seek first the fruit of the Spirit before anything
     else. In the end, we can have everything the world offers, but what
     does that mean if we don’t have righteousness, peace, and joy?
        If someone were to ask, “But does this mean that Jesus isn’t inter-
     ested in my physical or financial well-being?” How would you answer
     in the light of Christ’s command to put the fruit of the Spirit before
     physical or material needs?
        A concerned mother said, “Pastor, please pray for my boy. He is
     out of the faith, and he has lost his job. Pray that he will find work.”
     Was this concerned mother seeking first the kingdom of God and His
     righteousness for her son? Keeping in mind that the priority of the
     Christian life is not to get but to become, what should her request for
     her boy have been?

      What are your main concerns as revealed not just by your
      prayers but by your life in general: getting what you want for
      yourself or becoming what God wants you to become? What
      does your answer tell you about your priorities?
                                                                         105

      Other Fruit of the Spirit
         Galatians 5:22, 23 and Ephesians 5:9 are not the only texts that
      list the fruit that constitute the essence of Christian character. Many
      of the fruit are repeated in 1 Timothy 6:11, 2 Timothy 3:10, and
      2 Peter 1:5–7, where qualities are added, such as godliness, virtue, and
      knowledge. It is interesting to note that 1 Corinthians 13:4–8 echoes
      the qualities of love and states many of them using the negative word
      not: “does not envy; . . . does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does
      not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no
      evil; does not rejoice in iniquity” (NKJV).
         It should be clear by now that there is not one official checklist
      when it comes to the fruit of the Spirit. There are many different
      aspects and nuances of Christian character. What the apostles do in
      each case is to list those that are especially applicable to their readers.
      What led Paul to the enumeration in Galatians was doubtless his pas-
      toral knowledge of the particular needs of the congregation to which
      he was writing.
         The fruit of “godliness” is mentioned in 1 Timothy 6:11. In the
      original language, the word godliness means “reverence, respect, and
      piety toward God.” Romans 5:4, 5 mentions the quality of “hope.”
      What role does hope play in the Christian character? When all is said
      and done, our Christian faith offers us nothing if not hope.
         Second Peter 1:5–7 is a list of qualities, among them “virtue,”
      which is not mentioned in the list in Galatians 5:22, 23. Virtue is
      associated with moral goodness as are modesty and purity. Why is
      this quality indispensable in the Christian life? How does this quality
      relate to the seventh commandment?
         Second Peter 1:5, 6 adds “knowledge” to the list. Though the word
      that is used, gnosis, signifies general knowledge and understanding as
      fruit of the Spirit-filled life, what role would knowledge play? How
      would knowledge relate to, for instance, the gift of discernment?
         Peter did not call his list in 2 Peter 1:5–7 the fruit of the Spirit, but
      essentially that’s what the qualities listed are, because they reveal
      what kind of people we should be as followers of Jesus.

       How well are these characteristics manifested in your own life?
       If you are discouraged by what you see, what’s your one hope?
       What’s the only place you can flee to, and what can you find
       there?

     Perseverance in Faith
       Yesterday’s discussion question brought up the question of how
     well we are doing in cultivating the fruit that is our privilege to bear
     for the honor and glory of God. No doubt, as one looks at all these
     qualities of character and then compares oneself to them, it would be
     easy to get discouraged. After all, shouldn’t we be bearing more fruit
     than we are?
       That’s a fair question, one that we should all seriously think about.
     “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith” (2 Cor. 13:5). We
     need to take stock of ourselves, of how we are living and of what kind
     of witness we present to the world.
       At the same time, too, we can face a danger. As Christians, we have
     the example of Jesus, the only sinless human being who ever lived.
     As we compare ourselves to Him, how easy it could be to get discour-
     aged. How easy to see His sinlessness and perfection in contrast to our
     sinfulness and weaknesses. We do have a perfect standard to follow, a
     perfect law to obey, and a perfect Savior to emulate. As we all know,
     we often fall far short of that standard, of that law, and of that Savior.
     How easy it can be, too, after falling and falling, after not seeing the
     kind of growth we would like, to get discouraged, even to the point of
     giving up, thinking, “Why bother? I just can’t do it.”
       Here, though, is where we need to understand fully what salvation
     by faith is about. Here is where we need to understand where our
     salvation lies, and here is where we need to understand what Jesus
     accomplished for us on the cross.

Read Romans 3:20–26. What message is there for us about salva-
     tion? Why is this truth so important to cling to, especially when
     we feel discouraged about the state of our own fruit?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      No matter how earnestly we seek to live the Christian life and
      fight the battle against sin and self, as long as we keep before us,
      every day, every moment, the reality that our acceptance with
      God is found in Jesus and His righteousness, which He worked
      out for us and which He credits to us by faith, we will never
      give up. Why should we? Our salvation remains secure, not in
      ourselves but in Jesus.

      The Challenge of the World
        “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone
      loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 John 2:15,
      NKJV). What is this text saying? Does it mean that God doesn’t
      love those who love the world, or that those who love the world
      don’t love God? Explain.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________


        “At times the longings of the soul go out for holiness and heaven;
      but there is no time to turn aside from the din of the world to listen
      to the majestic and authoritative utterances of the Spirit of God.
      The things of eternity are made subordinate, the things of the world
      supreme. It is impossible for the seed of the word to bring forth fruit;
      for the life of the soul is given to nourish the thorns of worldliness.”
      —Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 51.
        While we must be aware of the dangers of legalism, ancient Israel
      always backslid when it tried to contemporize itself and become like
      the nations around it. First John 2:15 warns that love of the world
      makes impossible a heartfelt love for God. How careful we need to
      be as a church in making sure that, in our attempts to reach the world,
      we don’t become enamored by it and swept into it, all in the name of
      the Lord!

How can a person know when his or her love for the world has super-
      seded his or her love for God? What signs should we look for?
        		

         The danger of loving the world more than God takes on new mean-
      ing in James 4:4: “Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that
      friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore
      wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God”
      (NKJV). Why would James use the metaphor of adultery for church
      members who are swept up with the world? Notice, too, how in
      1 John 2:15 John leaves no room for compromise. It’s either God, or
      it’s the world.

       What aspects of the world do you struggle with the most? What
       things do you find alluring? How can you learn to fight the fight
       of faith and not get swept up in something that, in the end, can-
       not satisfy and will destroy you?

How to Grow the Fruit of the Spirit
(John 15:8)

   Although we cannot make a seed grow, there are definitely things
we can do that will facilitate growth until it bears fruit. So it is in the
Spirit-filled life. While the work of the Holy Spirit in the heart of the
believer is a part of the great mystery of life itself, Scripture has given
us definite instruction on how to encourage that growth so that we
may fulfill Jesus’ desire that we bring forth much fruit to the glory of
the Father (John 15:8).
   What follows below are some ways to encourage the growth of the
fruit of the Spirit:
   Through study of the Word of God. What does 2 Timothy 3:16
declare that the Scripture is profitable for? As a result, what will be
accomplished in our lives? (See vs. 17; see also Ps. 119:105.)
   Through prayer. “Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of
spiritual power. No other means of grace can be substituted, and the
health of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart into immedi-
ate contact with the Well-spring of life, and strengthens the sinew and
muscle of the religious experience. Neglect the exercise of prayer, or
engage in prayer spasmodically, now and then, as seems convenient,
and you lose your hold on God. The spiritual faculties lose their vital-
ity, the religious experience lacks health and vigor.”—Ellen G. White,
Gospel Workers, pp. 254, 255.
   Through the right kind of thoughts. “Finally, brethren, whatso-
ever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things
are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
there be any praise, think on these things” (Phil. 4:8). How can we
learn to keep our mind on elevated thoughts?
   Through our Christian witness. The man that Jesus healed of
demons requested to go with Him. Jesus denied his request and rather
asked him to return to where he lived and tell what the Lord had done
for him (Mark 5:18–20). How does sharing our faith contribute to the
growth of the fruit of the Spirit in our lives?

 The fruit of the Spirit isn’t going to happen on its own. Your
 own choices will determine your destiny. What changes do you
 need to make in your lifestyle, in your associations, in anything
 and everything you do that can better allow for your spiritual
 growth?

    Further Study: “God bids us fill the mind with great thoughts,
          pure thoughts. He desires us to meditate upon His love and mercy,
          to study His wonderful work in the great plan of redemption. Then
          clearer and still clearer will be our perception of truth, higher, holier,
          our desire for purity of heart and clearness of thought. The soul dwell-
          ing in the pure atmosphere of holy thought will be transformed by
          communion with God through the study of the Scriptures.
             “ ‘And bring forth fruit.’ Those who, having heard the word, keep
1         it, will bring forth fruit in obedience. The word of God, received into
          the soul, will be manifest in good works. Its results will be seen in a
          Christlike character and life. Christ said of Himself, ‘I delight to do
          Thy will, O My God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.’ Ps. 40:8. ‘I
          seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent
          Me.’ John 5:30. And the Scripture says, ‘He that saith he abideth
2         in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.’ 1 John
          2:6.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 60.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 As a church, with a mission to spread the three angels’ mes-
           sages to the world, we often struggle to find ways to make our-
           selves and our message relevant to the culture around us. What
           inherent dangers do we face when we do that? History shows
3          that more often than not, the church through the centuries ends
           up getting converted to the ways of the world, as opposed to the
           world getting converted to the ways of the church. What about us,
           as Adventists? Do we fool ourselves into thinking that this isn’t
           happening to us, or that it can’t happen to us? Do we see evidence
           of this already happening? And, if so, what can we do?

           2 In the twenty-first century, in your own culture, what are
           some of the greatest challenges to growing the fruit of the Spirit?
           What specific aspects of the culture must you unflinchingly fight
           against?

           l3 Why is the Cross so central to the whole question of the fruit
           of the Spirit and character development? What does the Cross
           offer us that’s indispensable in character development? After all,
           without the Cross, what would even be the purpose of bearing
           this fruit?
           			
           l4 Why do our character development and good works bring
           glory to God? What’s that all about?

In Difficult Times: Part 2
by Richard Lasu
   We were trying to plant a church in Kajo Keji, southern Sudan, but
Satan was angry. A few days after we started work, our landlord threw us
out. Soldiers patrolled the streets, and it was dangerous to be out. But we
didn’t know where to go.
   We knelt and placed our lives in God’s hands. Then we started walking.
We reached a home behind a large fence. I knocked, and a security guard
answered. The man knew we were pastors and told the owner, who invited
us to sleep in his sitting room. The next morning this man told us he was
a soldier and was being transferred to another area. He invited us to stay
in his house and care for it for as long as we needed it.
   Nearby we found a big mango tree. We cleared the debris from under
it and started holding worship services there. Two days later the woman
who had befriended us found us and asked for Bible studies.
   One Sabbath we were worshiping with five other people when a soldier
came saying he had a warrant to arrest our former landlord’s wife. I asked
the soldiers to wait until our worship was over, but he refused, saying he
must take her immediately. Finally he agreed to allow us to pray with her
before he took her away.
   Just as the soldier and the woman disappeared around a curve, a plane
flew over and dropped bombs on the town center. The soldier fled the
scene, and the woman returned to worship with us. Our prayer service
turned into a praise service.
   Within a few months 30 people were worshiping with us, and 11
people were preparing for baptism. Other churches in the area weren’t
happy about our work and tried to break up our new congregation. But we
fasted and prayed, and God worked on our behalf. The woman who had
befriended us became a leader in the church.
   It isn’t easy to plant a church among opposition. But God blessed our
efforts. The war in southern Sudan has disrupted the lives of millions of
people, but peace has come, and the people are returning to their villages.
The church in Kajo Keji is growing again.
   Your mission offerings help advance the work in difficult places around
the world. Thank you!

2010    Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

          Next quarter’s Bible study guide will look at the wonderful truths God
       has given to the Adventist health movement. The Lord revealed these
       principles because He loves us and wants what is in our best interest. This
       quarter’s lesson on healthful living written by the General Conference
       Health and Temperance Ministries Department was produced with the
       goal of helping us to achieve as healthful a lifestyle as possible until the
       Lord provides “the redemption of our bodies” (Rom. 8:23, NIV).
