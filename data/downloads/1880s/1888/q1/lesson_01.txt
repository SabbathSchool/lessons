           Late Missionary at Basel, Switzerland, Editor of Les Signes des Temps, and author of numerous
                                           Theological Books and Tracts.


      This book has been revised and enlarged, and now contains 548 pages, with steel portrait of author.
It is a mine of useful information on the Sabbath question. It treats the subject from a Biblical and his-
torical standpoint. Every passage of Scripture which has any conceivable connection with the Sabbath,
in the Old Testament or in the New, is examined at length. The various steps by which the change from
the seventh day to the first day was made, 'and the final exaltation of the Sabbath, are given in detail.
Every Bible student should have a copy of this book.
